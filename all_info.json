{"8_17": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The stairwell.\nLeonard: I was unstoppable. I mean, I was, I was on fire. It was like my mind and my body were totally connected, like, like athletes must feel when they\u2019re in the zone.\nPenny: Again, it was miniature golf.\nLeonard: Admit it, you\u2019re a little turned on.\nPenny: You can\u2019t be this proud.\nLeonard: Why not?\nPenny: Because I beat you.\nLeonard: Hey.\nPenny: Hi.\nSheldon: Oh, good. You\u2019re back.\nAmy: We have some exciting news.\nLeonard: Okay.\nSheldon: As you know, Amy and I have been together a long time, and a lot of things I never thought possible now seem possible.\nPenny: Okay.\nAmy: After a careful evaluation of our relationship, we decided that the time was right to take a step forward.\nLeonard: Okay.\nSheldon: Do you want to say it?\nAmy: Let\u2019s say it together.\nTogether: We\u2019re getting a turtle.\nPenny: This is why I\u2019ve been saying we should keep champagne on ice.\nSheldon: Sarcasm?\nAmy: Yes.\nSheldon: Okay. That was tricky, \u2019cause when it comes to alcohol, she generally means business.\nLeonard: Well, we\u2019re, we\u2019re very happy for you.\nPenny: Yes.\nAmy: Thank you. Acquiring a joint pet is a big step for us.\nSheldon: No. It\u2019s true. It means that we care so much about each other, there\u2019s enough left over for an eight-ounce reptile.\nLeonard: Why a turtle?\nSheldon: After much deliberation, we\u2019ve determined that a turtle is the ideal pet. They don\u2019t shed fur, they don\u2019t make noise.\nAmy: For Halloween, we can dress him as a cobblestone.\nSheldon: Yeah. And if he ever goes berserk, I know I can outrun him. Coincidentally, that\u2019s also why I chose you as a roommate.\nLeonard: Well, congratulations. Who would\u2019ve thought you two would be the first in our group to start a family?\nPenny: Mm-hmm.\nAmy: That\u2019s what I said.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: Emily\u2019s apartment.\nRaj: So, where\u2019s your roommate tonight?\nEmily: Well, I thought it was a little unfair that she\u2019s always here, and you never get a chance to stay over, so I killed her.\nRaj: But remember our agreement? You can joke about murdering people, but you have to say just kidding.\nEmily: And the more important thing to remember is that I\u2019d never hurt you. Oh, crap. I have to run over to the hospital and check on a patient.\nRaj: That\u2019s okay. I can come back later.\nEmily: No. No, don\u2019t be silly. I won\u2019t be gone long. Just stay here.\nRaj: Okay, cool. Oh, and you\u2019re sure your roommate\u2019s not gonna come back while I\u2019m here alone, right? \u2018Cause that\u2019ll be awkward.\nEmily: Oh, don\u2019t worry. She\u2019s in Palm Springs.\nRaj: Oh, good.\nEmily: Well, her torso is. Just kidding. I put her in a wood chipper.\nScene: A pet store.\nSheldon: Oh, dear Lord. Oh, dear Lord.\nAmy: It\u2019s okay. You made it. We\u2019re fine.\nSheldon: That was a lot of puppies.\nAmy: Let\u2019s forget about them, and pick ourselves out a nice turtle. Oh, how about this one up on the log?\nSheldon: Oh, I don\u2019t know. He kind of looks like a jerk. How about this one?\nAmy: Well, he\u2019s barely moving. He looks half dead.\nSheldon: I know. I like him, too. Hi, little guy. How\u2019d you like to come home with us? You\u2019ll be living with me because we don\u2019t live in the same house.\nAmy: But that\u2019s not your fault. Like you, we\u2019re taking it ridiculously slow. You\u2019ll stay with me when he\u2019s at Comic-Con or away for work.\nSheldon: Or if they accept Daddy\u2019s application to live on Mars.\nAmy: What are you talking about?\nSheldon: Oh, there\u2019s this company that\u2019s attempting to establish a colony on Mars, and I applied to be among the first to go. What should we name him? You know, I came in thinking Seth, but he kind of looks Italian.\nAmy: You applied for a mission to be a colonist on another planet, and couldn\u2019t be bothered to tell me?\nSheldon: Would you have approved?\nAmy: Of course not.\nSheldon: Well, based on your reaction, it looks like I made the right choice. Isn\u2019t that right, Giuseppe?\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: Hey, hey. Listen, I, I have a little confession to make.\nPenny: Aw, is this your first time?\nLeonard: No, I got you something for Valentine\u2019s Day, and I was too embarrassed to give it to you.\nPenny: Well, why?\nLeonard: Well, \u2019cause I got it at the dirty store.\nPenny: You went to the dirty store without me?\nLeonard: In sunglasses and a hat after I parked two blocks away.\nPenny: Well, get it. Get it for me.\nLeonard: Yeah?\nPenny: Yeah.\nLeonard: Okay, uh, well, I hope it\u2019s fun. I mean, it, it comes with paints, and, and it\u2019s kind of creative and artistic.\nPenny: Okay, did you go to the dirty store or Michaels?\nLeonard: No, no. We cover ourselves in body paint, and then, then we get on this big canvas and do our thing.\nPenny: Whoa, that\u2019s kind of a big step for a guy who only recently agreed to take his socks off.\nLeonard: You\u2019re making fun of me. Forget it.\nPenny: No. No, come on, I want to do it.\nLeonard: Really?\nPenny: Yeah, let\u2019s you, me, and your very, very pale feet make some art. Hey, when you got back to this store, I want to go with you.\nLeonard: Okay, but it\u2019s a drive, the one I went to is in San Diego.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s apartment.\nHoward: How are the taxes going?\nBernadette: Okay. But you got a lot of receipts for the Lego store in here.\nHoward: Those are business expenses. You can write those off.\nBernadette: A two hundred dollar R2-D2 is a business expense?\nHoward: Oh, Bernie, you\u2019re gonna have to sound a lot more confident when we get audited. (On phone) Hey, what\u2019s up?\nRaj: Oh, Emily ran back to the hospital, so I\u2019m just hanging out at her place. What are you, uh, what are you doing?\nHoward: Just playing video games while Bernie does the taxes.\nRaj: What are you, a little kid? Is she gonna cut your dinner into little pieces, too?\nHoward: She doesn\u2019t have to, I filled up on jelly beans.\nRaj: So, uh, what game are you\u2026 Oh. Crap.\nHoward: What\u2019s wrong?\nRaj: I can\u2019t get Emily\u2019s night-stand to close.\nHoward: So?\nRaj: She\u2019s gonna know I was looking in it.\nHoward: Why were you looking in it?\nRaj: Well, there\u2019s a question I better have a good answer to before she gets back.\nHoward: Okay, calm down. There\u2019s probably something jammed behind it. Just, uh, pull it out and see what\u2019s there.\nRaj: Hang on. Oh no. Oh, no. Oh, God, no.\nHoward: You know what, you sound busy, I\u2019m gonna let you go.\nRaj: Dude, the whole front came off. Now she\u2019s gonna know I was snooping.\nBernadette: What\u2019s happening?\nHoward: Raj was snooping through Emily\u2019s drawers and broke one.\nBernadette: Aw. I\u2019m gonna miss her.\nScene: Penny\u2019s bedroom.\nPenny: So what do you think?\nLeonard: I thought it\u2019d be a little more, just more.\nPenny: I\u2019m not even sure why we were out of breath. Uh, I mean, did we move at all?\nLeonard: Maybe along the z-axis, but x and y are looking pretty sad.\nPenny: Okay, come on. We are not old boring people. We can do better than this.\nLeonard: Uh, Th, that\u2019s true. How late did we stay up last night?\nPenny: Almost 1am.\nLeonard: Damn straight, almost 1am. And we weren\u2019t even watching TV. We were watching Netflix, like the kids do.\nPenny: Yeah, is it a comedy? Is it a drama? Nobody knows. Now, come on. We are gonna do this.\nLeonard: Yeah. You get the paint, I\u2019ll rest for 30 to 40 minutes, and then we do this.\nScene: The stairwell. \nSheldon: I can\u2019t believe you almost had me bring a wild animal into my home.\nAmy: No one told you to poke the turtle\u2019s face.\nSheldon: I was playing Got Your Nose. That\u2019s how you get children to like you.\nAmy: I\u2019m surprised you even care if he likes you, since you\u2019re planning on leaving the planet the first chance you get.\nSheldon: Ugh, this again. Amy, I\u2019ve already had one new hole torn in my body today. I don\u2019t need another one.\nAmy: Sheldon, I know the odds of you even going to Mars are incredibly small, but it still hurts that you would volunteer for something that would take you away from me forever.\nSheldon: So you\u2019re saying you wouldn\u2019t leave me for the chance to be one of the first humans to colonize another planet?\nAmy: I would at least mention it before filling out the application.\nSheldon: Huh, that\u2019s exactly what Leonard, Wolowitz, Koothrappali, Bernadette and Penny said.\nAmy: And who says you could even survive an interplanetary mission, anyway? You could barely survive a tiny turtle bite.\nSheldon: First of all, this has only made me stronger. But beyond that, all I did was fill out an application.\nAmy: You know what? Go to Mars, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Is there anything I can do to cheer you up?\nAmy: No. Forget it.\nSheldon: What if I play the Star Trek theme on my nose?\nAmy: Please don\u2019t.\nSheldon: Yep, you\u2019re mad.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s apartment. Howard is on the phone to Raj.\nHoward: Okay, let me see the damage.\nRaj: Hang on.\nHoward: Well, I think you broke the dowels. You\u2019re not gonna have time to glue it back on, you\u2019ll have to nail it.\nRaj: With what?\nHoward: Does she have any pillows or wine glasses?\nRaj: She does.\nHoward: Great. Neither of those. Try a hammer.\nRaj: Did that feel good? You feel like a big man now?\nScene: The apartment. \nSheldon: I was going to make you red zinger, but since Mars is the red planet, I went with peppermint.\nAmy: Why do you even want to do this?\nSheldon: Actually, as part of the application, I was required to make a short video answering that very question. You want to see it?\nAmy: Can\u2019t you just tell me?\nSheldon: But I made a video.\nSheldon (on video): I\u2019m Dr. Sheldon Cooper, and I\u2019d like to tell you why I should be chosen to go to Mars. I\u2019m exceedingly smart. I graduated college at 14. While my brother was getting an STD I was getting a PhD. Penicillin can\u2019t take this away. Being in close quarters, cleanliness is important and my hygiene is impeccable. In fact, animals don\u2019t trust me because I smell like nothing. Literally nothing. During the seven-month space flight, I can keep up morale with my wacky sense of humour. Hey, Leonard, is there any peanut brittle left in that can?\nLeonard (on video): You mean this weirdly suspicious one?\nSheldon (on video): Yes. Open it and check.\nLeonard (on video): I don\u2019t get it. There\u2019s actually peanut brittle in\u2026 Please go to Mars.\nSheldon (on video): But on a more serious note, the most important reason I want to go to Mars is that I believe, as a scientist, it\u2019s my duty to push the boundaries of human knowledge forward. Now, I know that life on Mars will be difficult. But life here on Earth is no picnic. Also, picnics are no picnic. Where should we go for lunch? Oh, I know, the ground. In conclusion, thank you for considering me for this journey of a lifetime. To Mars.\nSheldon: Afterwards, Leonard blew his nose, and pie came out.\nScene: Penny\u2019s bathroom.\nLeonard: Right there, right there, Oh, God, that\u2019s it.\nPenny: How did you get paint in your eye?\nLeonard: Because you wouldn\u2019t let me wear safety goggles.\nScene: Emily\u2019s bedroom. Raj is still on the phone with Howard.\nRaj: This looks terrible. She, she\u2019s gonna know.\nHoward: It\u2019s fine. You just need two more nails.\nRaj: Okay, where should I put them?\nHoward: In Emily\u2019s eyes.\nRaj: You\u2019re not helping.\nBernadette: Well, maybe this is what you get for snooping.\nRaj: You know, it, it\u2019s bad enough that I have to deal with this\u2026\nEmily: Raj? I\u2019m back.\nRaj: Oh, no. Hey.\nEmily: Hi.\nRaj: How was the hospital?\nEmily: Fine. What were you doing in there?\nRaj: Uh w, well, okay, look, I, I don\u2019t want to lie to you. I got curious, I was looking around and I broke the drawer on your night stand.\nEmily: You were looking in my night stand?\nRaj: Yeah.\nEmily: So, the first time I leave you alone, you snoop on me?\nRaj: You\u2019ve never snooped around my apartment?\nEmily: No.\nRaj: Come on, think back. It would really help if you had.\nEmily: I can\u2019t believe you don\u2019t trust me.\nBernadette: She sounds really mad.\nHoward: We should hang up.\nBernadette: Yeah, we should.\nHoward: But we\u2019re not going to, are we?\nBernadette: Not a chance.\nHoward: What happened to snooping is wrong?\nBernadette: Howard, you\u2019re going to jail for tax fraud. Who cares?\nScene: Penny\u2019s bedroom.\nLeonard: Well, we did it.\nPenny: We sure did.\nLeonard: I mean, I was on fire. I, I was in the zone, like an athlete.\nPenny: Sweetie, I beat you at this, too.\nLeonard: So, where do we want to hang it?\nPenny: What? Are you kidding? We\u2019re not hanging it.\nLeonard: But it\u2019s an expression of our love.\nPenny: And our butts. Not hanging it.\nLeonard: Seems a shame to throw it away.\nPenny: Yeah. We could give it to Sheldon, and tell him William Shatner painted it.\nLeonard: God, I love you. I love you so much.\nScene: The apartment. \nAmy: I think I\u2019m gonna go home.\nSheldon: Why? I really don\u2019t understand what\u2019s happening here.\nAmy: You know, Sheldon, at any other time, learning that you had plans to go live on Mars would be a slow news day. But a couple of hours ago, we were getting a turtle. And silly as it sounds, I thought that meant something.\nSheldon: Amy. Oh, why didn\u2019t I give her Sleepy Time tea? Amy, wait. Getting a turtle meant a great deal to me, too.\nAmy: Sure. Unless something better comes along.\nSheldon: Do you want me to withdraw my application?\nAmy: What I want is for us to be planning our future together.\nSheldon: And in that future, are we on the same planet? Because I\u2019ve seen people make the long-distance thing work.\nAmy: We\u2019re on the same planet.\nSheldon: Okay. Does that planet have to be Earth?\nAmy: Are you asking me to go to Mars with you?\nSheldon: I am. Yeah, if I\u2019m going to a barren, lifeless environment where the chances of survival are slim to none, I want you there with me. Why don\u2019t we go back to the apartment, and fill out your application?\nAmy: Okay. I suppose being the first people on a new planet would be incredibly exciting.\nSheldon: Oh, I know. We could be the first to plant a flag on Mars. We could be the first to watch Mars Attacks! on Mars. We could be the first to say good lord, what on Mars are you talking about?\nAmy: You know, we could also be the first people to procreate on Mars.\nSheldon: You just can\u2019t keep it in your space pants, can you?\nAmy: Think about it. If we had a family there, our kids would be Martians.\nSheldon: They would, wouldn\u2019t they? We could give them cool Martian names. And we could teach them about Martian history. Like, who planted those flags? And, uh, where did that copy of Mars Attacks! come from?\nAmy: I guess we\u2019ll have to make a new video together, as a couple.\nSheldon: Good idea. And since you\u2019ve had such a rough day, I\u2019m gonna let you throw the pie in Leonard\u2019s face.\nScene: Emily\u2019s bedroom.\nRaj: Thank you for forgiving me.\nEmily: That\u2019s okay. At some point, we were bound to have our first fight.\nRaj: Well, it almost happened when you called my apple pie crust doughy, but the truth is you were right, and I was just angry at myself.\nEmily: Can I ask you one thing?\nRaj: Of course. What?\nEmily: Did you look in my closet?\nRaj: No. Just the drawer.\nEmily: You promise you didn\u2019t look in the closet?\nRaj: I promise. Why, what\u2019s in there?\nEmily: Don\u2019t worry about it. Good night.\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "7_23": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The upstairs landing of Mrs Wolowitz\u2019s house.\nBernadette: Almost there. You\u2019re doing great.\nHoward: Thanks for lifting my spirits. Next time, try lifting the box.\nRaj: Please hurry.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): I don\u2019t need a treadmill.\nHoward: The doctor says you need to get exercise.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): I get plenty of exercise.\nHoward: Crushing my will to live isn\u2019t exercise.\nRaj: If she isn\u2019t gonna use it, then why are we doing this?\nHoward: She\u2019ll use it. All I need is to rig it with a fishing pole and a HoneyBaked Ham.\nRaj: All right. Now what?\nBernadette: We set it up in Howie\u2019s old room.\nRaj: Do you know how to set it up?\nHoward: Please, I\u2019m an MIT-trained engineer. I think I can handle\u2026 Ma, look out.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Aaaaah! I told you this thing would kill me.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The apartment.\nRaj: So she\u2019s gonna be laid up for at least six weeks.\nLeonard: Poor Mrs. Wolowitz.\nAmy: Should we do something for her?\nSheldon: I know. Let\u2019s go see the new Spider-Man movie.\nAmy: Sheldon, we\u2019re talking about your friend\u2019s mother. She got hurt.\nSheldon: I thought that subject had run its course, so I changed it. It\u2019s called reading the room, Amy.\nPenny: Hi.\nLeonard: Hey, how were things on the set?\nPenny: Uh, pretty good, actually.\nRaj: So the movie\u2019s not as bad as you thought?\nPenny: Oh, no, it is, but I decided instead of complaining about it, I\u2019m just gonna go in every day and give it my all.\nAmy: Good for you.\nPenny: Thanks. There\u2019s no reason why I shouldn\u2019t be the best bisexual go-go dancer slowly transforming into a killer gorilla anyone\u2019s ever seen.\nLeonard: I don\u2019t know. The bisexual gorilla go-go dancer in Schindler\u2019s List is tough to beat.\nSheldon: Ah, very good. Because a gorilla go-go dancer of any sexual preference would be out of place in a film about the Holocaust.\nLeonard: It only gets funnier when you explain it, Sheldon.\nSheldon: I know.\nScene: Mrs Wolowitz\u2019s house.\nHoward: Okay, she\u2019s all settled in the guest room.\nBernadette: Maybe we should get one of those machines to help her up the stairs.\nHoward: You mean a forklift?\nBernadette: Howie.\nHoward: I\u2019m sorry. I just can\u2019t deal with this right now.\nBernadette: Taking care of your own mother? How can you say that?\nHoward: Bernie, she\u2019s gonna be off her feet for six to eight weeks. Are you prepared to feed her, wash her and take her to the toilet?\nBernadette: I would do it for my mother.\nHoward: Yeah, of course you would, you\u2019re a loving person. I\u2019m what my people would call a putz.\nBernadette: Look, I\u2019m not crazy about the idea, but what other choice do we have?\nHoward: We get a nurse. Preferably someone from a third world country who\u2019s used to suffering and unpleasant smells.\nBernadette: You\u2019d hire a total stranger to take care of the woman who raised you? That\u2019s so cruel.\nHoward: Not if we pay them well and let them listen to the music of their homeland.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): I need to tinkle.\nHoward: Sounds like a job for a loving person. Would you like me to play some Polish music while you carry her to the toilet?\nBernadette: You are a putz.\nHoward: As advertised.\nScene: A cinema.\nSheldon: Thanks for coming with me.\nRaj: Thanks for inviting me after everyone else said no. Aren\u2019t you gonna get 3-D glasses?\nSheldon: I brought my own. No sense in risking bridge-of-nose herpes.\nRaj: Is that a real thing?\nSheldon: Well, until they invent nose condoms, I\u2019m not finding out.\nRaj: Emily, Hey.\nEmily: Oh, hey, Raj.\nRaj: Uh, this is my friend, Sheldon. Sheldon, this is Emily.\nSheldon: Oh, yes, you\u2019re the dermatologist. I went for a walk yesterday without sunscreen. Do you see anything on my forehead that I should be concerned about?\nEmily: Um, you know what? I better go. My movie\u2019s about to start.\nRaj: Are you here alone?\nEmily: No, not really.\nRaj: What do you mean, not really?\nMan: Hey, should we get our seats?\nEmily: Yeah. It was nice seeing you. Um, I\u2019ll call you later.\nRaj: Yeah, okay.\nSheldon: That was awkward, right?\nRaj: Uh-huh.\nSheldon: Is it because she\u2019s dating you but was out with that other fellow?\nRaj: Yes.\nSheldon: Good. I thought she saw something on my forehead.\nScene: The movie set. \nDirector: And action.\nWil Wheaton: Please don\u2019t shut me out.\nPenny: Go away. Just go away.\nWil: I swear, I will find a way to turn you back.\nPenny: What gave you the right to mix my DNA with that of a killer gorilla?\nWil: I was trying to save your life.\nPenny: Life? What life? Look at me, I\u2019m a monster. And now I have blood on my hands, or paws. I don\u2019t know.\nWil: You can\u2019t give up. I love you.\nPenny: I love you, too. But I\u2019m afraid I love killing more. Like, one day, I might actually try and kill you.\nDirector: And cut. All right. All right, let\u2019s set up for the next scene.\nPenny: Actually, you know what? Can we do one more? I think I could do it better.\nDirector: Let\u2019s just move on. No one cares.\nPenny: Well, I care. I mean, look, if we\u2019re gonna do this, why not try and make it something we\u2019re actually proud of?\nDirector: Look, sweetie, this movie is garbage, but you should be happy about that, \u2019cause if it was a good movie, you wouldn\u2019t be in it.\nLeonard: Whoa, whoa, hang on. There\u2019s no need to insult her.\nDirector: And who are you?\nLeonard: I\u2019m her boyfriend.\nDirector: Isn\u2019t she too hot for you?\nLeonard: A little, yeah.\nDirector: Well, boyfriend, get off my set.\nPenny: You can\u2019t do that. He\u2019s with me.\nDirector: You know what? You can get off my set, too. You\u2019re fired.\nPenny: What? You can\u2019t fire me. I\u2019m the star. I\u2019m the girl that goes bananas. It says so on the poster.\nDirector: Yeah, but we just shot the last scene where we see your face. So from now own, the star of the movie is whoever wears this.\nWil: Hey, if you\u2019re gonna fire her, then you have to fire me, too.\nScene: A bar.\nWil: Wow, that fell apart really fast.\nScene: The apartment.\nRaj: Thanks for skipping the movie. I couldn\u2019t sit in that theatre for two hours wondering about Emily and that guy.\nSheldon: Oh, quite all right. After my forehead melanoma scare I\u2019ve learned not to sweat the small stuff. Well, sorry, I don\u2019t have all the ingredients to make chai tea.\nRaj: You don\u2019t have to make me anything.\nSheldon: No, I do. You\u2019re upset about Emily and you\u2019re Indian. I need to make you chai tea. Now, I have all the ingredients except cardamom seeds. Do you happen to have any on you?\nRaj: Sorry, I left them in my turban.\nSheldon: Oh, I\u2019ll make English breakfast tea. They destroyed your culture. That\u2019s close enough. You know, I\u2019m curious, why are you so upset about seeing Emily with another man?\nRaj: Wouldn\u2019t you be upset if you saw Amy out with someone else?\nSheldon: Can\u2019t happen. We have an ironclad relationship agreement which precludes her from physical contact with anyone other than me.\nRaj: But you don\u2019t have sex with her, either.\nSheldon: Slick, huh?\nRaj: To be truthful, Emily and I haven\u2019t dated that long, and we never agreed to be exclusive to each other.\nSheldon: Have you had intercourse?\nRaj: No.\nSheldon: Well, stick to your guns. There will be a lot of pressure.\nScene: Mrs Wolowitz\u2019s house.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): I\u2019m hungry again.\nHoward: It\u2019s like the world\u2019s fattest cuckoo clock.\nBernadette: You know, you\u2019re always talking about having a baby someday. This is exactly what it\u2019s gonna be like.\nHoward: No, it\u2019s not.\nBernadette: Come on. The constant fussing, eating, pooping, burping, drooling. We\u2019re even waiting for the day when she can finally walk on her own.\nHoward: Maybe you\u2019re right. Anything she finds on the floor goes right in her mouth.\nBernadette: I\u2019m just telling you now, if we do have kids, don\u2019t expect me to do all the work.\nHoward: Hey, I\u2019m a very paternal person. I\u2019d be excellent at taking care of a baby.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): I\u2019m still hungry.\nHoward: I\u2019m coming, you big baby.\nScene: The bar.\nPenny: You know, the only thing worse than doing a movie where they glue monkey hair to your ass is getting fired from a movie where they glue monkey hair to your ass.\nWil: Forget it, man, it\u2019s crap. You just move on to the next thing.\nPenny: Yeah, well, it\u2019s easy for you to say. You used to be famous.\nWil: Hey. I just lost a job for you.\nPenny: All right, I\u2019m sorry, you\u2019re famous.\nWil: Penny, it\u2019s not about being famous. It\u2019s about the art. It\u2019s about the passion we have for our craft. (Text message tone) I have an audition for Sharknado 2. If I book this, I am totally gonna pay you back for this beer.\nPenny: God, what am I doing with my life?\nLeonard: You having second thoughts about acting?\nPenny: You were on set, you saw what it was like.\nLeonard: Yeah, but it\u2019s not always that bad.\nPenny: Oh, really?\nLeonard: What about when you did, uh, Anne Frank at that cute little theater?\nPenny: It was over a bowling alley.\nLeonard: Yeah, but there was ample parking.\nPenny: Are you done?\nLeonard: And you were so good in the TV commercial.\nPenny: It was for haemorrhoid cream.\nLeonard: And I got itchy and swollen just watching you.\nPenny: Leonard, you are really not cheering me up.\nLeonard: Come on. How can you be sad when you\u2019re going home with all five-foot-six of this?\nPenny: Hmm. You think you\u2019re five-foot-six, that\u2019s funny.\nScene: The apartment.\nRaj: I don\u2019t understand it. I\u2019m a nice guy, I have a great job, I\u2019m well-educated, come from a good family. Why don\u2019t women want to be with me?\nSheldon: An interesting question. Well, good night.\nRaj: What? Don\u2019t send me home. I can\u2019t be alone right now.\nSheldon: That\u2019s your problem. You can\u2019t be alone.\nRaj: What do you mean?\nSheldon: How many women have you had dates with?\nRaj: Eleven.\nSheldon: How many of those women did you think would become your perfect companion?\nRaj: Eleven. Wait. Do I count the 200-pound Sailor Moon girl that Howard and I had a threesome with at Comic Con?\nSheldon: Sure.\nRaj: I\u2019ll stick with eleven. She liked Howard better.\nSheldon: Well, now do you see the problem?\nRaj: Maybe. I, I don\u2019t know.It\u2019s late, I should, I should go. Look, I do get what you\u2019re saying. Instead of desperately clinging to any woman who will go out with me, I need to work on my fear of being alone.\nSheldon: I was trying to suggest chemical castration, but it\u2019s my bedtime, so whatever gets you out the door. Good night.\nScene: Mrs Wolowitz\u2019s house.\nBernadette: Howie, I\u2019m back!\nHoward: Shh, I just got her to sleep.\nBernadette: Sorry.\nHoward: What took you so long? The grocery store is a few blocks away.\nBernadette: They only had regular yoghurt. I had to go to a different store to get the extra-fat kind your mom likes.\nHoward: Then why do I smell coffee on your breath?\nBernadette: So what? After two days of taking care of her, excuse me for stopping to get a mocha.\nHoward: A mocha? Well, it must be nice to be queen.\nBernadette: Queen? I\u2019ve been killing myself here.\nHoward: Well, whose fault is that? I wanted to get a nurse, but you were all, I\u2019m nice, I want to take care of people.\nBernadette: I\u2019m glad I got that mocha. And you know what else I\u2019m glad about? I bought you a brownie and I ate it in the car.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Howard.\nHoward: Thanks a lot. Now I have to go rub her belly again.\nScene: Raj\u2019s apartment.\nRaj: Hey.\nEmily: Thanks for letting me come over.\nRaj: Of course. Please, come in.\nEmily: I just wanted to say how sorry I am about tonight, and I want to make sure that we\u2019re okay.\nRaj: Uh, look, you and I haven\u2019t made any commitments to each other.\nEmily: I know. I just felt like I needed to explain. The guy I was with did my last tattoo, and he\u2019s been asking me out for months. I finally said yes just to get it over with.\nRaj: It\u2019s okay.\nEmily: Really?\nRaj: Well, I mean, yeah, it freaked me out a little, but that\u2019s my issue, not yours.\nEmily: Wow. If I saw you out with another woman, I\u2019d be pretty upset.\nRaj: Thank you. Not just for being upset, but for believing that could happen.\nEmily: Just so you know, I\u2019m not seeing anyone else.\nRaj: Well, me, neither.\nEmily: Okay.\nRaj: Okay. Please. So, uh, you, you have tattoos?\nEmily: Yeah.\nRaj: I don\u2019t. I have a hole in my belly button that may or may not have been a piercing.\nEmily: That\u2019s cool.\nRaj: It\u2019s a piercing. So, uh, how many tattoos?\nEmily: One on my shoulder, one not on my shoulder and one really not on my shoulder.\nRaj: It\u2019s, uh, been a long time since I\u2019ve seen a girl\u2019s really not her shoulder.\nEmily: Well, how about you show me your piercing and I show you my tattoos?\nRaj: But, uh, before I take my shirt off, I just need like ten minutes to do some crunches.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment.\nPenny: Oh, my God. What a day.\nLeonard: Can I get you anything?\nPenny: No. I need to start making some smart decisions.\nLeonard: With your career?\nPenny: With my life.\nLeonard: Like what?\nPenny: I don\u2019t know. We could get married.\nLeonard: Come on, be serious.\nPenny: I am.\nLeonard: Why? Because I\u2019m a, a smart decision?\nPenny: Well, yeah.\nLeonard: So I\u2019m like a bran muffin.\nPenny: What? No, that\u2019s not what I\u2019m saying.\nLeonard: No, it\u2019s exactly what you\u2019re saying. I\u2019m the boring thing you\u2019re choosing because I\u2019m good for you.\nPenny: What does it matter? The point is, I\u2019m choosing you.\nLeonard: Well, it matters a lot. I don\u2019t want to be a bran muffin. I, I want to be a Cinnabon, you know? A strawberry Pop-Tart. Something you\u2019re excited about even though it could give you diabetes.\nPenny: Sweetie, you can be any pastry you want.\nLeonard: No, no. No, it\u2019s too late. I\u2019m your bran muffin. Probably fat-free and good for your colon.\nPenny: You know what? Forget it. I never should\u2019ve brought it up.\nLeonard: You know I want to marry you, but you\u2019re only doing this because you got fired and you\u2019re feeling sorry for yourself.\nPenny: Okay, it may look that way, but getting fired from that movie was the best thing that could have happened to me, okay? I finally realize I don\u2019t need to be famous or have some big career to be happy.\nLeonard: Then what do you need?\nPenny: You, you stupid Pop-Tart.\nLeonard: Oh. Then I guess I\u2019m in.\nPenny: Really? You guess you\u2019re in?\nLeonard: Not like, I guess I\u2019m in. Like I guess, I\u2019m in!\nPenny: Okay. Leonard: Cool.\nLeonard: So is that it? Are, are we engaged?\nPenny: Yeah, I think so.\nLeonard: All right.\nPenny: What\u2019s wrong?\nLeonard: I\u2019m not sure. Just feels a little anticlimactic.\nPenny: Yeah, it kind of does, huh?\nLeonard: Oh, I know. This might help.\nPenny: Where did you get a ring?\nLeonard: I\u2019ve had it for a couple years, not important. Penny, will you marry me?\nPenny: Oh, my God, yes.\nLeonard: This would have been so much more romantic if you didn\u2019t have monkey hair on your finger.\nScene: Mrs Wolowitz\u2019s house.\nHoward: How you feeling?\nBernadette: Last night was a little rough, but I think we\u2019re gonna get through this.\nHoward: I\u2019m proud of us.\nBernadette: Me, too.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Where\u2019s my pancakes?!\nForeign Nurse: Coming, Mrs. Wolowitz!\nBernadette: You were right.\nHoward: Welcome to Team Putz.\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "7_10": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: A radio studio.\nIra Flatow: This is Science Friday. I\u2019m Ira Flatow. My guest today is responsible for the discovery of the first stable super-heavy element. Welcome, Dr. Sheldon Cooper.\nSheldon: Thank you. Uh, the university made me come here. I didn\u2019t want to. Uh, big fan of the show.\nIra: So, I understand that you actually discovered this element by mistake.\nSheldon: Yes.\nIra: And some people in the science community are calling it The Wonder Blunder.\nSheldon: Who? Give me their names. I bet it\u2019s Wolowitz.\nIra: It\u2019s just such a fascinating story. Your calculations are way off, but they find the element anyway. It\u2019s like misreading a treasure map and still finding the treasure.\nSheldon: Can we talk about something else? Do you know that I yodel?\nIra: That\u2019s interesting, but this could be taking you down the path toward a Nobel Prize. And in chemistry, no less. And wouldn\u2019t that be unusual? Because you\u2019re a physicist.\nSheldon: Yes, yes, I\u2019d be a physicist with a Nobel in chemistry. Everyone laugh at the circus freak. You know, I don\u2019t need to sit here and take this, Flatow. It is because of bullies like you, every day more and more Americans are making the switch to television.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The apartment. Sheldon is on the phone.\nSheldon: President Seibert, I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re yelling. You\u2019re the one who made me go on the radio. I was expecting a professional science interview, not an attack by some morning zoo shock jock. Well, if the university needs money so badly, perhaps you should start a swear jar. Whoa, that one\u2019s worth a dollar.\nAmy: I know you don\u2019t like it, but every time you do an interview, it raises the profile of the university. That translates to funding.\nSheldon: Yeah, well, I\u2019m not just some trained monkey dancing for coins.\nLeonard: Of course you\u2019re not. People love trained monkeys.\nPenny: How can you not be happy? You\u2019re tall, thin and famous. Oh, my God, I\u2019m jealous of Sheldon.\nSheldon: Look, you\u2019re gonna be doing this stuff for a while. You\u2019re just gonna have to find a way to get used to it.\nSheldon: But none of you know what this is like. Being celebrated for something you wish you never did.\nPenny: Mmm, you clearly haven\u2019t been with me at Mardi Gras.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s apartment.\nBernadette: Want to pause the video game and help me clean up?\nHoward: I am cleaning up. Look at the mess the Joker made of Gotham City.\nBernadette: Come on, it\u2019s your friend who\u2019s coming to stay here.\nHoward: Raj grew up in India. Trust me, he\u2019s seen worse.\nBernadette: Howie. \nHoward: I promise I\u2019ll help out the rest of the week.\nBernadette: The rest of the week? You said it was just gonna be a night or two.\nHoward: Yeah, but if I told you a week, would you have said yes?\nBernadette: No.\nHoward: Then you left me no choice.\nBernadette: I love Raj, but that\u2019s a long time for a house guest.\nHoward: I know, but they\u2019re tenting his building. He can\u2019t find a hotel he likes that allows dogs.\nBernadette: He\u2019s bringing Cinnamon?\nHoward: For a whole week, the nerve of some people.\nScene: Sheldon\u2019s bedroom. Sheldon is playing with his train set.\nSheldon: Here comes the Embarrassment Express. With stops at Fraudville, Wonder Blunderberg, and Kansas City. Because it\u2019s a hub.\nAmy: Sheldon, can I come in?\nSheldon: Do you have cookies?\nAmy: No.\nSheldon: Good. I don\u2019t deserve cookies. Come in. Wil?\nWil Wheaton: Hey, Sheldon. It\u2019s been a while.\nSheldon: Why are you here?\nWil: Amy said you were having a rough time, and I thought maybe we could talk. Is that okay?\nSheldon: Certainly. Although, right now, I\u2019m having a rough time because there\u2019s three people in my room, and it\u2019s starting to feel like a discotheque.\nAmy: Sheldon, you said you were unhappy getting attention for something you wished you never did.\nWil: Yeah, I know a little something about that.\nSheldon: Oh, nonsense, Wil. Your endless tweets are not that bad.\nWil: I remember why it\u2019s been a while. Sheldon, I was actually talking about when I was a kid on Star Trek.\nSheldon: How could you not like getting attention for playing Wesley Crusher? You were wonderful. A know-it-all boy genius with an eidetic memory. Who couldn\u2019t relate to that?\nWil: Well, not everybody felt that way. A lot of people really hated the character, and some of them hated me because of it. I would do interviews, and people would be mean to me.\nSheldon: That just happened to me. Next time you\u2019re stuck for a tweet, feel free to say what a jerk Ira Flatow is.\nAmy: Sheldon, the point is Wil learned to embrace that part of his life and moved on to bigger and better things.\nWil: Yeah, I\u2019m an author now, I do public speaking, and I have my own Web series about board games.\nAmy: Uh, we\u2019re trying to cheer him up, so\u2026 \nWil: I\u2019m just saying that there was a time when I thought I would never get out of Wesley Crusher\u2019s shadow. But now, it\u2019s just one small part of a pretty great life, and it\u2019s a part that I\u2019m happy is there.\nSheldon: I do see what you\u2019re saying. That helps.\nWil: Good.\nSheldon: Would you two like to stay and play trains with me?\nWil: Sure.\nAmy: Okay.\nSheldon: Oh, great, now, I work the controls, I say all aboard. You sit quietly and watch.\nWil:Can I blow the whistle?\nSheldon: You should probably go.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s apartment.\nHoward: You\u2019re gonna brush your teeth on my couch?\nRaj: No, I\u2019m gonna brush Cinnamon\u2019s teeth.\nHoward: Why bother? She spends half the time licking her butt.\nRaj: And the other half licking my face. That\u2019s why I\u2019m brushing her teeth.\nBernadette: Hey, guys. Sorry I\u2019m so late. Did you already have dinner?\nHoward: No, we were waiting for you.\nBernadette: Aw, that\u2019s so sweet.\nHoward: Yeah. So what do you feel like making?\nRaj: Howard, the poor thing just got home from work. Let me get you a glass of wine. I\u2019ll cook dinner.\nBermadette: Oh, Raj, you\u2019re our guest.\nRaj: Don\u2019t be silly. Sit. You look like you\u2019ve had a long day.\nHoward: No, she always looks like that. Because she married an idiot.\nBernadette: Thank you, Raj.\nRaj: Please, this is my way of thanking you for letting me stay here. Now, tell us all about your day.\nBernadette: Okay, um, well, first, I was late to a meeting \u2019cause I was stuck in traffic.\nHoward: Well, I keep telling you to put that traffic app on your phone.\nRaj: Hey, when you got home today complaining that you felt sick from eating too many jelly beans, did I tell you how to fix it? No. I said, aw, that must hurt, and I rubbed your belly.\nHoward: I thought of you the whole time.\nRaj: All I\u2019m saying is there\u2019s a time to just listen. \nBernadette: Thank you.\nRaj: There\u2019s also a time to stop eating too many jelly beans. And it\u2019s when you\u2019re ten.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Hello, President Siebert. Thank you for taking my call. I just wanted you to know that you can now expect enthusiastic participation from me regarding my discovery. Oh, no, no, no, no. No need to thank mNo, thank my friend, Wil Wheaton. For your information, I have nine friends, hmm? Ten if we include you. Nine it is. Ah, it\u2019s ten. I\u2019ll count Wolowitz. Hello, friend Leonard.\nLeonard: Hey, you\u2019re in a good mood.\nSheldon: I\u2019m in a great mood.\nLeonard: Well, you\u2019re about to be in an even better one. I didn\u2019t want to say anything until I knew for sure, but, I\u2019ve been re-running the tests on your element in my lab and I disproved it. Your element does not exist.\nSheldon: Yeah, but what about the Chinese research team? They found it.\nLeonard: Yeah, it turns out someone added simulated signals to the data files. They faked the results.\nSheldon: Really?\nLeonard: Yes. Do you know what that means? That means all of this attention that you hate goes away.\nSheldon: So no more interviews?\nLeonard: No, it\u2019s all over.\nSheldon: I can\u2019t believe it.\nLeonard: Well, you\u2019re welcome.\nSheldon: You robbed me of my greatest achievement.\nLeonard: What?\nSheldon: I\u2019m back down to nine friends. Make it eight, I\u2019m sick of Wolowitz, too.\nLeonard: I, I don\u2019t understand. All you\u2019ve done since you discovered this stupid element was complain. I was trying to make you happy.\nSheldon: By taking away my only claim to fame? Well, if you wanted to make me happy, you could have told me a joke. Or shown me a cute video of a koala and an otter becoming unlikely friends.\nLeonard: Oh, there is no winning with you. And koalas and otters don\u2019t even live near each other.\nSheldon: That\u2019s what makes their friendship unlikely,\nPenny: Hey, what\u2019s with all the yelling?\nSheldon: Leonard disproved my element. Now all the attention is going to go away.\nPenny: Oh, that\u2019s great. You must be thrilled, \nSheldon: That\u2019s it, I\u2019m down to seven friends.\nPenny: He\u2019s counting hobbits and superheroes, right?\nSheldon: When I thought the element was real, I didn\u2019t want it. But now that Leonard made it not exist, I want it more than anything in the world.\nLeonard: The, the element never existed. I didn\u2019t take it away, science took it away. Be mad at science.\nSheldon: Don\u2019t you dare use science against me. Science is my best friend. Oh, good, I\u2019m back up to eight.\nLeonard: Will you tell him he\u2019s out of his mind.\nPenny: Actually, I get what he\u2019s saying.\nSheldon: Oh, yes, nine. Welcome back, buddy.\nPenny: It\u2019s like if you\u2019re dating someone you\u2019re not that into, and then they break up with you and then you want them more than ever.\nSheldon: I have no idea what she\u2019s talking about, but we\u2019re ganging up on you so I agree.\nLeonard: Okay, Sheldon, what do you want me to do, hide the information? If I don\u2019t publish it, it\u2019s just a matter of time before someone else does.\nSheldon: No, no, of course you have to publish. That\u2019s your responsibility as a scientist. Doing otherwise would be unethical. You have no choice.\nLeonard: Fine, I\u2019ll publish.\nSheldon: Can you believe this guy?\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s apartment.\nBernadette: Aw! Raj did the dishes.\nHoward: How do you know I didn\u2019t do them?\nBernadette: Because once, when all the knives were dirty, you cut a bagel with your keys.\nRaj: Good morning, everybody. I picked up coffee while I was out. Bernadette, here\u2019s your soy peppermint mocha.\nBernadette: Aw, you didn\u2019t have to do that.\nRaj: Oh, my pleasure, and don\u2019t worry about your presentation today. You\u2019re gonna be great.\nHoward: Yeah, you\u2019re gonna knock it out of the park.\nBernadette: What presentation do I have today?\nHoward: Just go.\nRaj: He loves you.\nHoward: What are you doing? Are you trying to make me look bad?\nRaj: I\u2019m just being a good house guest.\nHoward: No, you\u2019re being a better husband than I am. Doing the dishes, getting coffee, knowing about her life, who does that?\nRaj: Oh, come on, I brought you one, too.\nHoward: I don\u2019t want coffee.\nRaj: That\u2019s why I got you hot chocolate.\nHoward: Give me that. Just stop showing me up.\nRaj: Howard, listen to me. You\u2019re a great husband. Yes, your listening skills could use some work. But it\u2019s amazing how far you\u2019ve come given that you\u2019re an only child raised by an over-protective mom.\nHoward: Um, is this getting weird?\nRaj: Hang on.\nHoward: So, yes.\nScene: Sheldon\u2019s office.\nLeonard: Hey. I just wanted to let you know that I, I posted my findings.\nSheldon: I saw. And I just posted a retraction of my paper. Now the whole scientific community knows I was wrong.\nLeonard: These things happen all the time, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Not to me. The only other retraction I ever had to issue was when I was seven and I conceded that my brother was the greatest ninja in East Texas. But that was just a ploy to get my face out of his armpit.\nBarry: Thew he is. It\u2019s my favowite superhewo, the Wetwactor.\nLeonard: Come on, don\u2019t give him a hard time.\nBarry: I\u2019m sowwy, Cooper. I wetwact it. By the way, Hofstadter, nice job dispwoving the Chinese team.\nLeonard: It\u2019s not a big deal.\nBarry: It\u2019s a huge deal. Cooper, maybe physics just isn\u2019t your thing. Have you ever considered a caweer in wetail? That way you could take things back for a wiving.\nLeonard: Okay, Barry, that\u2019s enough.\nSheldon: No, no, no, that\u2019s okay. I can fight my own battles. Isn\u2019t that right, Bawwy.\nBarry: Is? Is that a wefewence to my speech impediment? That\u2019s pwetty hurtful. I, I can\u2019t contwol it.\nSheldon: You\u2019re right, That was uncalled for. I take it back.\nBarry: Of course you do. Because you\u2019re the Wetwactor.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s apartment.\nBernadette: Raj, this dinner was amazing. If you\u2019re here much longer, I\u2019m gonna have to buy bigger clothes.\nRaj: Nonsense. You need a little fattening up. You\u2019ve been looking too skinny lately.\nBernadette: Aw. Howie, how come you never say anything sweet like that?\nHoward: What are you talking about? Remember last week, when I asked you if you were wearing Spanx and you weren\u2019t? How\u2019s that different?\nBernadette: Maybe you could try being more thoughtful, like your friend Raj.\nHoward: Yeah, well, maybe you could try being more like Raj. \nBernadette: Oh, really?\nHoward: Yeah, yeah. He packed me a lunch this morning. And there was a note inside that said go get \u2019em.\nBernadette: Like I don\u2019t do enough around here. Now I need to pack your lunch? And by the way, why do you need a note telling you to go get \u2019em? You\u2019re a grown man, you should know to go get \u2019em.\nHoward: I do know to go get \u2019em, but sometimes it\u2019s nice to have emotional support when I\u2019m going and getting them.\nRaj: Hey, hey, do you hear yourselves? Let\u2019s just, you know, all calm down and take a step back.\nBernadette: This is stupid. Why are we fighting?\nHoward: I don\u2019t know. I guess I was just feeling like I\u2019m a lousy husband.\nBernadette: You\u2019re not a lousy husband. You\u2019re a great husband. I was the one feeling like a lousy wife.\nHoward: Are you kidding? You\u2019re the best. I know what the problem is. It\u2019s him.\nRaj: Oh, what did I do?\nHoward: You made us feel like we\u2019re not trying hard enough.\nBernadette: Yeah, we were totally fine half-assing our marriage till you showed up.\nRaj: Look, I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re upset with me, but I just have to say it\u2019s nice to see the two of you on the same page.\nHoward: Oh, it does feel good to have you backing me up for once.\nBernadette: I back you up all the time.\nHoward: That is not\u2026 he\u2019s doing it again. \nBernadette: What is wrong with you?\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: I can\u2019t believe they kicked you out. \nRaj: I can\u2019t believe they\u2019re still married. Oh, no, I forgot Cinnamon\u2019s toothbrush at Howard\u2019s. I guess you\u2019re sharing with Daddy again. \nPenny: Bark once if you need me to call PETA.\nSheldon: What\u2019s that animal doing in our apartment?\nLeonard: Oh, relax, she\u2019s in her crate. She can\u2019t get out.\nSheldon: I have two words for you, Jurassic Park. This day just keeps getting worse and worse.\nPenny: You know, if it makes you feel any better\u2026\nSheldon: It probably won\u2019t.\nPenny: You\u2019re probably right.\nAmy: Sheldon, it\u2019s a beautiful night. Why don\u2019t you and I go for a nice walk together?\nSheldon: Oh, everything is just sex with you isn\u2019t it?\nRaj: Sheldon, I think you might find the support you\u2019re looking for if you realize that relationships are a give and take. She can only be there for you as much as you are for her.\nAmy: Thank you, Rajesh.\nRaj: And, Amy, you need to be patient with Sheldon, instead of pressuring him to accept intimacy on your terms.\nAmy: You should probably go.\nScene: The radio studio.\nIra: I\u2019m Ira Flatow, and this is Science Friday. I\u2019d like to welcome back Dr. Sheldon Cooper, who thought he had discovered a new super-heavy element only to have it disproved by my next guest, Dr. Leonard Hofstadter. Welcome to Science< Friday, gentlemen.\nLeonard: Thanks.\nSheldon: Thank you. Ira, if I may, I\u2019d like to apologize for my behaviour last week.\nIra: It\u2019s all right.\nSheldon: Now, isn\u2019t there something you\u2019d like to say to me?\nIra: No. Now, Dr. Hofstadter. Can you walk us through the process you used to disprove his theory?\nLeonard: Well\u2026\nSheldon: I believe I can answer that.\nLeonard: He asked me.\nSheldon: Fine.\nLeonard: As I was saying\u2026\nSheldon: You\u2019re telling it wrong. Ira, to really understand the story here, you have to start at the very beginning. A small town in East Texas, where a young genius named\u2026\nLeonard: Sheldon.\nSheldon: That\u2019s right, Sheldon Cooper. He was bitten by his neighbour\u2019s dog, leading to his first scientific breakthrough, the doggie death-ray. Which, sadly, he couldn\u2019t build because Santa wouldn\u2019t bring him enriched uranium.\nIra: You know, I\u2019d really like to hear it from Dr. Hofstadter, if it\u2019s okay with you.\nSheldon: What a surprise. Did you invite me back just so you could ignore me?\nIra: Actually, I didn\u2019t invite you. You came in, you took a seat, and I\u2019m not comfortable with confrontation.\nLeonard: Sheldon, this interview is supposed to be about me.\nSheldon: Well, that seems like a snooze. Even for public radio.\nPenny (listening in her apartment): You know, if we did a shot every time they said something embarrassing, this would be one hell of a drinking game.\nAmy: A little early for alcohol, isn\u2019t it?\nSheldon: You know, I don\u2019t just say smart things about science. I also yodel. (Does)\nAmy: I\u2019ll get the vodka.\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "3_7": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The apartment.\nPenny: Wow, Sheldon, I cannot believe you made up your own game.\nSheldon: Oh, Research Lab is more than a game. It\u2019s like the slogan says, the physics is theoretical, but the fun is real.\nLeonard: We must not be playing it right.\nPenny: All right, five. One, two, three, four, five. Oh, wow, look at that, my Department of Defence research grant is renewed.\nSheldon: Oh! Great roll! Now you can demolish your Soviet-style cyclotron and build the large Hadron Collider.\nPenny: Yay.\nSheldon: You\u2019re a natural at this, Penny. And as the first beta testers, you two\u2019ll have quite the edge when we play with Wolowitz and Koothrappali on Sunday.\nLeonard: Oh, gee, Sheldon, I don\u2019t think we can play on Sunday.\nSheldon: Why not?\nLeonard: Because of the reasons that Penny will now tell you. Penny?\nPenny: Actually, I have to pick up my friend Justin from the airport.\nLeonard: There you go, she has to pick up her friend Justin at the airport, aAnd I can\u2019t play \u2019cause I\u2019m going with her, right?\nPenny: Um, yeah, if you want. I mean, there may not be room. He\u2019s got a lot of stuff, like guitars and amplifiers.\nLeonard: Wait. What are you talking about?\nPenny: My friend, Justin.\nSheldon: Pay attention, Leonard. That\u2019s why she can\u2019t play on Sunday.\nLeonard: Who is this Justin?\nSheldon: Your turn, Leonard.\nPenny: I told you about him.\nLeonard: No, you didn\u2019t.\nSheldon: Roll the dice, Leonard.\nPenny: Yeah, my friend from Omaha, plays the guitar. Anyway, he\u2019s coming to L.A. looking for some session work, so I told him he could just crash on my couch for a few weeks.\nSheldon: Come on, Leonard, if you roll a six, Penny dies horribly in a nuclear meltdown. See what I mean when I say the fun is real?\nLeonard: Hang on. Some guy is going to be sleeping on your couch?\nPenny: He\u2019s not some guy. He\u2019s my friend.\nLeonard: So by friend, do you mean friend friend, gay friend, or ex boyfriend who you\u2019re now platonic with but still might have a thing for you friend\u201d?\nPenny: Well, he\u2019s definitely not gay.\nLeonard: Oh, a definitely not gay musician sleeping on my girlfriend\u2019s couch. Yippee.\nPenny: Okay, we went out a little bit, a long time ago, but we were never like going out.\nLeonard: Okay, not to be pedantic, but the last I checked went out was in fact the past tense of going out, which I think we all know is a popular euphemism for saw each other naked.\nSheldon: I\u2019ll just roll for you.\nPenny: Do you have a problem with Justin staying with me?\nLeonard: What was your first clue?\nSheldon: Uh-oh! Industrial accident.\nPenny: You know what? Don\u2019t talk to me like I\u2019m an idiot.\nLeonard: I\u2019m not talking to you like you\u2019re an idiot! I\u2019m saying the whole idea is idiotic!\nSheldon: You accidentally stare at a helium-argon laser. Lose one turn and a retina.\nPenny: How is that not talking to me like I\u2019m an idiot? It\u2019s my friend, it\u2019s my couch, and it\u2019s my freakin\u2019 life!\nSheldon: It\u2019s also your roll.\nLeonard: You know what? It is your life. If you want to have some stupid guitarist stay on your couch, then fine. Why don\u2019t you just rent some bunk beds and invite The Black Eyed Peas?\nPenny: Hey, if I want to invite the entire line up of Lollapalooza to sleep in my apartment, I will, and it\u2019s none of your business!\nLeonard: Are you listening to yourself? Do you know how childish you sound right now?\nPenny: Oh, now I\u2019m a child? Well, at least I\u2019m not an idiot anymore!\nLeonard: The two aren\u2019t mutually exclusive!\nPenny: Oh, you are such a\u2026 (Sheldon has placed ice in the blender and turned it on) What the hell is he doing?\nLeonard: He\u2019s drowning us out. He doesn\u2019t like fighting.\nPenny: Sheldon, just stop, look, the fight is over. Oh, and FYI, you never even heard of The Black Eyed Peas until you met me!\nLeonard: I heard of \u2019em. Didn\u2019t know they were a band. Sheldon, she\u2019s gone. You can turn off the blender.\nSheldon: Has your relationship reached its inevitable ugly end?\nLeonard: No, we just had a little spat.\nSheldon: Look on the bright side. As the result of Penny\u2019s forfeit, you have become the world\u2019s first winner of Research Lab. Would you like a commemorative snow cone?\nCredits sequence\nScene: Leonard\u2019s car.\nLeonard: I don\u2019t get how she can just announce that an old boyfriend is going to be sleeping on her couch.\nSheldon: Hey, I thought of a game we can play in the car.\nLeonard: I don\u2019t want to play a game, Sheldon.\nSheldon: It\u2019s called Scientists. Now, I will name three scientists, then you will put them in order of the size of their contribution to their respective fields. To make this game even more compelling, you must consider only the contribution of the man to the field, not the validity of the field itself. For example, Abu Musa Jabir ibn Hayn made a greater contribution to the discredited field of alchemy than Halbert Vanderplatt made to neurobiology. Okay, ready to have some fun?\nLeonard: An old boyfriend who\u2019s definitely not gay. That\u2019s what a guy likes to hear, definitely.\nSheldon: All right, I\u2019ll start with an easy one, um, Isaac Newton, Madame Curie and Niels Bohr.\nLeonard: And then I say one little thing and I end up being the bad guy!\nSheldon: Hint, Madame Curie had her husband to help her.\nLeonard: What am I supposed to say? Sure, Penny, I\u2019m cool with your old boyfriend sleeping in your apartment. Well, Leonard, it doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re cool or not because I\u2019m Penny and I\u2019m pretty and I can do whatever the hell I want! Oh, I get it! You think you\u2019re doing me a favour just by being in a relationship with me! No, no, Leonard! I\u2019m doing you a favour just by being in the same room as you!\nSheldon: Leonard! Stop the car!\nLeonard: What?\nSheldon: I can\u2019t listen to the two of you fight anymore.\nScene: Leaving the apartment.\nSheldon: Come on, come on, we\u2019re late.\nLeonard: Calm down, we\u2019ll make the movie.\nSheldon: I believe my alarm is appropriate, given the situation. The movie starts in 17 minutes, which means we\u2019ll need to make all the lights on Colorado Boulevard, plus skip the concession stand, and preshow urination.\nRaj: Oh, dude, I wish you had said something before I pounded that last Red Bull.\nSheldon: Go, go, Power Rangers, go!\nPenny: Hey.\nLeonard: Hey. We\u2019re, uh, going to the movies.\nSheldon: No, we\u2019re not. We\u2019re standing in the hallway, suffering through an awkward encounter.\nLeonard: Hang on. They\u2019re showing a new digital print of Time Bandits, you wouldn\u2019t want to come, would you?\nPenny: Not really, no.\nSheldon: All right, invitation pointlessly offered, invitation declined as expected, everyone\u2019s civil, nobody\u2019s fighting. Have a nice evening.\nLeonard: Just give us a minute.\nHoward: Oh, take all the time you need.\nLeonard: So, are we going to talk about last night?\nPenny: Are you ready to apologize?\nLeonard: No.\nPenny: E-e-e-e-eh! Wrong answer, but thank you for playing.\nLeonard: Oh, come on. This is stupid.\nPenny: Oh, there it is again! You think I\u2019m stupid!\nLeonard: No, there\u2019s a difference between being stupid and acting stupid.\nPenny: Oh, yeah? well, there\u2019s a difference between being a jerk and being an ass!\nLeonard: No, there isn\u2019t! They\u2019re synonyms!\nRaj: Well, that was rather unpleasant.\nHoward: Yeah, I don\u2019t think I need my preshow urination anymore.\nSheldon: Leonard, when that woman moved in three years ago I told you not to talk to her, and now look, we\u2019re going to be late for the movies.\nScene: The comic book store.\n \nHoward: Hey! Look! Amazing Spider-Man 183.\nSheldon: Got it.\nHoward: Remember this one? Spider-Man loses a big fight and then his girlfriend breaks up with him. Want me to get it for you? It\u2019ll help take your mind off things.\nStuart: Hey, guys. What\u2019s going on?\nLeonard: Oh, we need to kill a couple hours till the next showing of Time Bandits.\nStuart: Oh, well, no problem. I was thinking of closing early and going home, but let\u2019s face it, that\u2019s just a slightly smaller lonely room filled with comic books.\nLeonard: Thanks, Stuart. Let me ask you something. Do you think it\u2019s okay for Penny to have an ex-boyfriend sleep on her couch?\nHoward: No, I mean, she\u2019s obviously way out of line.\nLeonard: Thank you!\nHoward: But if she dumps you, she\u2019ll have a new boyfriend by tomorrow morning and you\u2019ll have a new girlfriend when you figure out how to build one. So the only question is, how long until you fold?\nLeonard: I am not going to fold.\nRaj: Well, excuse me, I don\u2019t think Penny\u2019s out of line at all. You don\u2019t own her. It\u2019s like my girl, Beyonce says, if you like it, you shoulda put a ring on it.\u201d\nHoward: Come on. At the very least, when she found out Leonard was upset about it, she should\u2019ve backed off.\nRaj: You mean like when a guy\u2019s upset because his friend agreed to take a cooking class with him and then doesn\u2019t show up because he\u2019s doing a juice fast with his mother?\nHoward: I didn\u2019t know you were upset about that.\nRaj: Really! Did you miss all the subtle indicators, like me saying, Howard, I am upset.\nHoward: Okay, sorry.\nRaj: Maybe it means something different in this country. Back in India, it means you\u2019re upset with a guy named Howard!\nHoward: I said I\u2019m sorry.\nRaj: Sorry doesn\u2019t make up for the fact that I had to make chicken and rice with this vegan guy. Do you know what vegan chicken and rice is? Rice!\nHoward: Yeah, well, you think I was having fun, sitting around all night listening to my mother say \u201cHave you ever peed so much in your life?\u201d\nRaj: Oh, my God, you are such a mama\u2019s boy.\nHoward: Hey, don\u2019t bring my mother into this!\nRaj: You brought your mother into this!\nSheldon: Stop it, both of you. All this fighting, I might as well be back with my parents! Damn it, George, I told you if you didn\u2019t quit drinkin\u2019 I\u2019d leave you! Well, I guess that makes you a liar, \u2019cause I\u2019m drunk as hell and you\u2019re still here! Stop yelling! You\u2019re making Sheldon cry! I\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s making Sheldon cry! That I let you name him Sheldon.\nHoward: Boy, what got him so upset?\nRaj: Oh, sure, you can tell when Sheldon\u2019s upset.\nScene: The Cheesecake Factory.\n \nPenny: Oh, thank you very much. Come back soon. With the other half of my tip. Hey, Sheldon, what are you doing here?\nSheldon: This is a restaurant. It\u2019s lunchtime. I would think, as a waitress, you\u2019d be familiar with the paradigm.\nPenny: Is Leonard coming?\nSheldon: No, I believe Leonard is waiting for you to come crawling back to him and apologize.\nPenny: Well, that\u2019s not gonna happen.\nSheldon: I assumed that would be your attitude. Hence, my true purpose in coming here.\nPenny: Which is?\nSheldon: I want you to crawl back to him and apologize.\nPenny: I\u2019m busy.\nSheldon: Excuse me, miss. I\u2019d like to order lunch.\nPenny: Fine. What do you want?\nSheldon: I have a few questions. First, I notice that you offer soup and a half-sandwich?\nPenny: Yes.\nSheldon: Where exactly does the half-sandwich come from? Are you giving me half of someone else\u2019s sandwich, or do I have to wait for someone else in the restaurant to order the other half?\nPenny: No, no, Sheldon, they just make a half-sandwich.\nSheldon: You can\u2019t make a half-sandwich. If it\u2019s not half of a whole sandwich, it\u2019s just a small sandwich.\nPenny: Okay, fine, it\u2019s soup and a small sandwich. Is that what you want?\nSheldon: Of course not. I\u2019ll have my usual.\nPenny: Great.\nSheldon: Aren\u2019t you going to ask me if I want a beverage?\nPenny: Don\u2019t you usually get lemonade?\nSheldon: Yes.\nPenny: Do you want lemonade?\nSheldon: Yes.\nPenny: Anything else?\nSheldon: Yes, I want you to apologize to Leonard.\nPenny: I am not going to apologize. I\u2019ve done nothing wrong. He is completely overreacting.\nSheldon: Irrelevant. The disruption in your relationship is making my life intolerable.\nPenny: Well, I\u2019m sorry, Sheldon, but this really isn\u2019t about you.\nSheldon: I don\u2019t follow.\nPenny: Yeah, yeah, I\u2019ll be right there. Look, Sheldon, I have to go.\nSheldon: All right, let\u2019s assume, ad argumentum, that in this case, Leonard is wrong.\nPenny: Leonard is wrong.\nSheldon: Considering the number of transgressions you\u2019ve committed that he\u2019s overlooked, don\u2019t you think that, just this once, you could return the favour?\nPenny: I\u2019m coming. Goodbye, Sheldon. What do you mean, transgressions I\u2019ve committed?\nSheldon: Were you under the impression that Leonard has no complaints about you?\nPenny: Like what? Yeah, yeah, I see you, you\u2019re making a little cheque sign in the air, I got it, just hold your horses. What does Leonard complain about?\nSheldon: Your driving, the plethora of stuffed animals on your bed that stare at him during your amorous activities, your constant tardiness, your singing.\nPenny: My singing?\nSheldon: That\u2019s actually from my list, but Leonard would be a fool if he didn\u2019t agree with it.\nPenny: Okay, if Leonard has so many problems with me, why hasn\u2019t he just said so?\nSheldon: Because, according to him, you\u2019re oversensitive and have a temper.\nPenny: Oh, really? Well, then, do me a favour and tell Leonard that he can drop dead!\nSheldon: And she wonders why she\u2019s constantly undertipped.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: Hey.\nSheldon: Oh, good, you\u2019re home. I need you to do me a favour.\nLeonard: Sure.\nSheldon: Go apologize to Penny.\nLeonard: What?\nSheldon: Right now would be good.\nPenny (knocking): Leonard!\nSheldon: Although, a few minutes ago would have been better.\nPenny: I hear you don\u2019t like my stuffed animals, my driving or my punctuality.\nLeonard: What? Who would tell you something like that? Why would you tell her something like that?\nPenny: It doesn\u2019t matter why he told me. It\u2019s true, isn\u2019t it?\nLeonard: Okay, yeah, it\u2019s true, but I can live with that stuff. What I can\u2019t live with is you casually informing me that some guy\u2019s going to be staying in your apartment without even asking me first!\nPenny: That isn\u2019t even your problem, the problem is you don\u2019t trust me!\nLeonard: Oh, come on. Sheldon, have you ever once heard me say that I don\u2019t trust Penny? Sheldon? Where did he go?\nPenny: Oh, your yelling must have freaked him out again.\nLeonard: Where are you going? You just walk away in the middle of an argument?!\nPenny: No, I\u2019m going to go find your damn roommate before he hurts himself trying to cross the street or something!\nLeonard: Why didn\u2019t you say so?\nPenny: Oh, now I need your permission for that, too?!\nLeonard: Well, I can\u2019t read your mind, Penny!\nPenny: Really? Why not? You\u2019re so smart, and I\u2019m so dumb!\nScene: Raj\u2019s apartment.\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Raj. (Knock, knock, knock) Raj. (Knock, knock, knock) Raj.\nRaj: Stop knocking! It\u2019s open! Please tell my parents that our dark matter research is at a critical juncture, and I can\u2019t come home for my cousin Sanjay\u2019s wedding.\nMrs Koothrappali: Sheldon, ask our son what we\u2019re supposed to say to Mr. and Mrs. Choudhry, whose daughter, Lakshmi is flying in from London, for the sole purpose of meeting him.\nRaj: I didn\u2019t ask you to set me up with Lakshmi.\nMrs Koothrappali: You should be thanking us!\nDr Koothrappali: Yes, Lakshmi just got her stomach stapled. You have an opportunity to get in good with her before she loses weight, and her self-esteem goes up.\nRaj: I don\u2019t care! And why don\u2019t you think I can find a woman for myself?\nMrs Koothrappali: Because you\u2019re 27, and the closest thing we have to a daughter-in-law is that Jewish boy Howard.\nRaj: Oh, that is completely below the belt. Sheldon, tell my parents that Howard and I are just friends. Sheldon? Howard and I are just friends! Fine. I\u2019ll come home for Sanjay\u2019s wedding.\nScene: Penny\u2019s car.\nPenny (out of the window): Sheldon! (whistles) \nLeonard: What are you doing? He\u2019s not a lost dog.\nPenny: Hey, why don\u2019t you just let me find him while you sit there hitting your imaginary brake?\nLeonard: The brake might be imaginary, but that stop sign you just ran wasn\u2019t.\nPenny: What stop sign?\nLeonard: Eyes on the road. Eyes on the road!\nScene: Outside Howard\u2019s house. Sheldon rings the doorbell.\nHoward\u2019s Mother: Howard, answer the door! I\u2019m busy!\nHoward: I\u2019m busy too, you answer it.\nHoward\u2019s Mother: I can\u2019t! I\u2019m on the toilet!\nHoward: For God\u2019s sake, I don\u2019t need to hear that! Can\u2019t you just say, I\u2019m busy?\nHoward\u2019s Mother: I said I\u2019m busy, but that wasn\u2019t good enough for you!\nHoward: You know what? I hope it\u2019s one of those home invasion deals, and they shoot me in the head.\nHoward\u2019s Mother: Well, if it\u2019s a home invader, don\u2019t tell them I\u2019m on the toilet!\nHoward: There\u2019s no one there. You\u2019re hearing things, you crazy old lady!\nScene: The comic book store.\nLeonard: Hey, Stuart, have you seen Sheldon?\nStuart: Yeah, he\u2019s, uh, over in the graphic novel section. Built himself a little nest.\nLeonard: Thank you.\nStuart: Uh, Penny?\nPenny: Yeah?\nStuart: Is everything okay?\nPenny: What do you mean?\nStuart: Uh, Sheldon told me you and Leonard were having a fight?\nPenny: Oh, yeah, kind of. It\u2019s, it\u2019s no big thing.\nStuart: Oh, good, good. (She moves away) I love you.\nLeonard: I\u2019m not leaving until you talk to me.\nPenny: All right, what\u2019s going on?\nLeonard: It\u2019s a little hard to explain. He does this thing where he pretends he\u2019s in an alternate dimension that occupies the same physical space we\u2019re in, but he can\u2019t perceive us.\nSheldon: Don\u2019t flatter yourself. I\u2019m just ignoring you.\nPenny: Come on, Sheldon, let\u2019s go home. Look, we\u2019re done fighting.\nSheldon: I\u2019ve heard that before, but then, the next thing you know I\u2019m hiding in my bedroom, blaring a Richard Feinman lecture while my mom is shouting that Jesus would forgive her if she put ground glass in my dad\u2019s meatloaf, and my dad\u2019s on the roof skeet-shooting her Franklin Mint collectible plates.\nPenny: Okay, there\u2019s going to no more shouting and no skeet-shooting.\nSheldon: Really? Where\u2019s your friend Justin going to sleep?\nLeonard: Yeah, where\u2019s he gonna sleep?\nPenny: Oh, my God, would you let this go?!\nStuart: I\u2019d let it go.\nLeonard: Why should I let it go? Why don\u2019t you just tell the guy to find another place to sleep? (Sheldon turns on a loud toy robot) Oh, for God\u2019s sakes. So, you have childhood issues, we all have childhood issues, at some point, you just need to grow up and get past them. (Sheldon turns on another robot)\nPenny: Leonard, will you just let me handle this, please? Look, let\u2019s just\u2026 Sheldon, please,\ntry and understand. Look, Leonard and I are in a relationship, and occasionally, we\u2019re going to fight. But no matter what happens between us, we will always love you. Right, Leonard?\nLeonard: Always is a long time. Sure. Always.\nPenny: You know, how about we buy you this robot, and then we all go home?\nSheldon: I want that one.\nPenny: Okay, you can have that one.\nLeonard: Oh, come on, he\u2019s just going to play with it twice, and then it\u2019ll end up in his closet with all the other junk.\nPenny: Buy him the robot, Leonard.\nSheldon: Can I get this comic book, too?\nPenny: Yes, you can.\nStuart: We meet again.\nScene: Penny\u2019s bed. \nLeonard: So what did Justin say when you told him he couldn\u2019t sleep on your couch?\nPenny: He\u2019s a musician. He\u2019ll sleep in his own vomit, if he has to.\nScene: The apartment. Sheldon is in his spot. Beside him, a long haired bearded person is asleep. There is a guitar propped up on the arm of the sofa.\nSheldon: I should have asked for much more than a comic book and a robot.\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "4_2": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The apartment. Sheldon has a series of whiteboards across the room.\nLeonard: Whatcha doin\u2019 there? Working on a new plan to catch the roadrunner?\nSheldon: The humorous implication being that I am Wile E. Coyote?\nLeonard: Yes.\nSheldon: And this is a schematic for a bird-trapping device that will ultimately backfire and cause me physical injury?\nLeonard: Yes.\nSheldon: What I\u2019m doing here is trying to determine when I\u2019m going to die.\nLeonard: A lot of people are working on that research. So what is all this?\nSheldon: My family history factoring in longevity, propensity for disease, et cetera.\nLeonard: Interesting. Cause of death for Uncle Carl was KBB. What\u2019s KBB?\nSheldon: Killed by badger.\nLeonard: How\u2019s that?\nSheldon: It was Thanksgiving. Uncle Carl said, I think there\u2019s a badger living in our chimney. Hand me that flashlight. Those were the last words he ever spoke to us.\nLeonard: I don\u2019t think you need to worry about death by badgers being hereditary.\nSheldon: Not true. The fight or flight instinct is coded genetically. Instead of fleeing, he chose to fight barehanded against a brawny member of the weasel family. Who\u2019s to say that I don\u2019t share that flawed DNA?\nLeonard: You can always get a badger and find out.\nSheldon: But seriously, even if I disregard the Uncle Carl factor, at best I have 60 years left.\nLeonard: That long, huh?\nSheldon: 60 only takes me to here. I need to get to here.\nLeonard: What\u2019s there?\nSheldon: The earliest estimate of the singularity, when man will be able to transfer his consciousness into machines and achieve immortality.\nLeonard: So, you\u2019re upset about missing out on becoming some sort of freakish self-aware robot?\nSheldon: By this much.\nLeonard: Tough break. You want eggs?\nSheldon: You don\u2019t get it, Leonard. I\u2019m going to miss so much, the unified field theory,\u00a0 cold fusion, the dogapus.\nLeonard: What\u2019s a dogapus?\nSheldon: A hybrid dog and octopus. Man\u2019s underwater best friend.\nLeonard: Is somebody working on that?\nSheldon: I was going to. I planned on giving it to myself on my 300th birthday.\nLeonard: Wait a minute. You hate dogs.\nSheldon: A dogapus can play fetch with eight balls. No one can hate that.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The apartment.\nHoward: What do we owe you?\nLeonard: It came to $28.17. Let\u2019s say six bucks apiece.\nHoward: Here you go.\nLeonard: Thank you.\nPenny: What?\nLeonard: Never mind. I got it.\nPenny: Oh, you wanted me to pay.\nLeonard: It\u2019s no big deal.\nPenny: No, no, no, no. You\u2019re right. We\u2019re not going out anymore, I should pay for myself. (After Raj whispers to Howard, and Howard laughs) What?\nHoward: He said if he had woman parts, he\u2019d eat for free the rest of his life.\nPenny: Yeah, but you wouldn\u2019t be able to talk to yourself. I\u2019m a little low on cash.\nLeonard: Hmm? How much you got?\nPenny: Nothing.\nLeonard: How can you walk around with no money?\nPenny: I\u2019m cute. I get by.\nLeonard: It\u2019s okay, you can owe me.\nPenny: Okay.\nLeonard: Sheldon, six bucks.\nSheldon: No, thank you. I\u2019m not eating pizza tonight.\nPenny: But it\u2019s Thursday. Thursday\u2019s pizza night.\nSheldon: Not for me. Thursday is now Cruciferous Vegetable Night. Tonight\u2019s selection, brussels sprouts.\nHoward: Really? You\u2019re changing the Sheldonian calendar?\nSheldon: It\u2019s a small price to pay.\nPenny: For what?\nLeonard: No, no, don\u2019t ask.\nPenny: Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.\nSheldon: In order to live long enough to fuse my consciousness with cybernetics, I need to change my diet.\nPenny: Wait. Cybernetics is robot stuff, right?\nSheldon: Correct.\nPenny: So you want to turn yourself into some sort of robot?\nSheldon: Essentially, yes.\nPenny: Okay, here\u2019s my question. Didn\u2019t you already do that?\nSheldon: Flattering, but sadly, no. I\u2019m also planning to begin an exercise regimen designed to strengthen my cardiovascular system. AKA jogging.\nPenny: Wait. Honey,have you ever run before?\nSheldon: Certainly. I\u2019ve run from bullies, dogs, angry chickens, and one particularly persistent P.E. teacher determined to bend me over and give me a scoliosis test.\nHoward (after Raj whispers to him): You\u2019re right, Penny jogs. Maybe you guys can run together.\nSheldon: That\u2019s an excellent idea. Yeah, if we chat, it will create the illusion of time going faster.\nPenny: No, it won\u2019t. Um, how does he know I jog?\nHoward: Oh, he watches you from his car with high-powered binoculars.\nPenny: Oh, my God, that is so creepy!\nHoward: I know! (Raj whispers to him) And he says he\u2019s not gonna stop. (Raj whispers to him urgently) Then see a shrink and figure out how to talk to women.\nScene: Leonard\u2019s bedroom\nSheldon (off): (Knock, knock, knock) Ugh. (Knock, knock, knock) U-u-ugh. (Knock, knock, knock) Lenu-u-ugh.\nLeonard: What the hell? What\u2019s the matter?\nSheldon: I have pain radiating from my navel to my lower right abdomen. I\u2019m nauseated and feverish. I believe I may have cholera.\nLeonard: There\u2019s no cholera in Pasadena. Just like last summer, when there was no malaria in Pasadena.\nSheldon: Well, if it\u2019s not cholera, then based on a quick Internet search, the other explanations in decreasing order of likelihood are Hirschsprung\u2019s Disease, botulism, a 30-foot tapeworm or accidental ingestion of chrysanthemum blossoms.\nLeonard: When would you have accidentally eaten chrysanthemum blossoms?\nSheldon: It\u2019s part of an unlikely scenario that involves sleepwalking and a 24-hour flower mart with a less-than-vigilant proprietor. Oh, Lord, my belly!\nLeonard: Have you had your appendix out?\nSheldon: I haven\u2019t. I\u2019ve been meaning to, but who has the time?\nLeonard: Let\u2019s get you to the hospital.\nSheldon: So this is how it ends, with cruel irony. Just as I make the commitment to preserving my body, I am betrayed by my appendix, a vestigial organ. Do you know the original purpose of the appendix, Leonard?\nLeonard: No.\nSheldon: I do. And yet I\u2019m doomed while you live on.\nLeonard: Funny how things work out, isn\u2019t it?\nSheldon: Oh, Lord, I think it\u2019s about to burst! (Loud sound of farting) On the other hand, it might have been the Brussels sprouts.\nLeonard: Good night.\nSheldon: Good night. Appendicitis. What a nervous Nelly.\nScene: The hallway.\n \nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny.\nPenny: Coming, coming. Hey, nice knees.\nSheldon: Thank you. They\u2019re my mother\u2019s.\nPenny: Oh. And the Flash shirt is what? Because you\u2019re gonna run really fast?\nSheldon: No, the Flash shirt is because it\u2019s Friday, but it\u2019s nice when things work out. Where\u2019s your heart rate monitor?\nPenny: I don\u2019t have one.\nSheldon: What about your pedometer?\nPenny: Don\u2019t have one.\nSheldon: Do you have telematics in your shoes connected to an iPod?\nPenny: Uh, no.\nSheldon: What do you do, you just go out there and gambol about like a bunny?\nPenny: No. I just run till I\u2019m hungry, then I stop for a bear claw.\nSheldon: Why are you doing that?\nPenny: It\u2019s good to stretch your muscles before you run.\nSheldon: All right.\nPenny: All right, let\u2019s start with a toe touch. Okay, you do it.\nSheldon: I am doing it.\nPenny: Oh. Wow. Good job. Okay, um, can you do this?\nSheldon: We\u2019ll never know.\nPenny: Okay, let\u2019s just warm up on the run.\nSheldon: Okay.\nPenny: Okay, let\u2019s go.\nSheldon: Yeah, I\u2019ve been reading up on biomechanics. I think you\u2019ll be surprised at my\u2026 Wah! Oh!\nPenny (squealing): Oh, my God, are you okay?\nSheldon: I think so.\nPenny: Oh, let me help you up.\nSheldon: Thank you. (Loud sound of farting)\nPenny: Oh, Sheldon!\nSheldon: If it makes you feel any better, Thursday is no longer Cruciferous Vegetable Night.\nScene: The apartment. \n \nLeonard: Here\u2019s my chicken curry. Howard, your shrimp biryani.\nHoward: Thank you, sir.\nLeonard: Palak paneer, that\u2019s Penny.\nPenny: Thanks.\nLeonard: And for Rajesh Koothrappali, from whose homeland these tasty dishes originate, one large order of chicken McNuggets.\nPenny: Hey, what\u2019s my share?\nLeonard: Uh, 12 bucks.\nPenny: Okay, can I get you after Friday when I get paid?\nLeonard: Sure.\nPenny: What am I up to now?\nLeonard: Well, okay, with the Indian food, the pizza, the Thai food, the tank of gas, the frozen yogurt and your rent, uh, a little over fourteen hundred dollars.\nPenny (after Raj whispers to Howard and they both laugh): What now?\nHoward: He\u2019s just expressing his admiration that you don\u2019t even have to put out to get free stuff.\nPenny: It\u2019s not free, I\u2019m gonna pay him back. (Raj whispers. Both laugh again) Shut up!\nLeonard: Sheldon, are you gonna join us?\nSheldon: Coming! (From the bedroom area, a wheeled device consisting of a base, a tee-shirt on a coat hanger, and a computer monitor with Sheldon\u2019s face, appears). Greetings, friends.\nLeonard: Greetings, whatever the hell you are.\nSheldon-bot: I am a mobile virtual presence device. Recent events have demonstrated to me that my body is too fragile to endure the vicissitudes of the world. Until such time as I am able to transfer my consciousness, I shall remain in a secure location and interact with the world in this manner.\nHoward (after Raj whispers to him): Really? That\u2019s your question? When did he put a ramp in?\nSheldon-bot: You\u2019re in my spot. This may seem a little odd at first, but over time you\u2019ll grow accustomed to dealing with me in this configuration.\nPenny: Yeah, to be honest, I don\u2019t see much difference.\nSheldon-bot: Thank you. That\u2019s what I was going for. Now, Leonard, tomorrow, when we go to work, you\u2019ll need to allow some extra time to get me down the stairs. For your convenience, I disassemble into four pieces.\nLeonard: This is ridiculous. I\u2019m coming to talk to you.\nSheldon-bot: You don\u2019t know where I am. My physical body is safely ensconced in a secure, undisclosed location.\nLeonard: You\u2019re in your bedroom.\nSheldon-bot: No, I\u2019m not.\nLeonard: I can hear your voice coming from your bedroom.\nSheldon-bot: No, you can\u2019t. Wait. Come back. Halt. Authorized personnel only!\nPenny: So, either one of you weirdos want to buy my underwear? Only fourteen hundred bucks.\nScene: Sheldon\u2019s bedroom.\nLeonard: Sheldon, this is ridiculous.\nSheldon: I\u2019m behind you. Please look at me when you\u2019re talking to me.\nLeonard: I am looking at you.\nSheldon: No, you\u2019re not. Pay no attention to that man in the bed.\nLeonard: You cannot exist as a virtual presence. Not here and certainly not at work. Oh, good God.\nSheldon: At my age, do you know how I\u2019m statistically most likely to die?\nLeonard: At the hands of your roommate?\nSheldon: An accident.\nLeonard: That\u2019s how I\u2019m going to make it look.\nSheldon: Until I can transfer my intellect to a more durable container, my body will remain safely ensconced in my bed.\nLeonard: Fine, but don\u2019t expect my help.\nSheldon: You have to help, it\u2019s in the roommate agreement.\nLeonard: No, it\u2019s not.\nSheldon: Section 74.C. The various obligations and duties of the parties in the event one of them becomes a robot.\nLeonard: I\u2019ll be damned.\nScene: Leonard\u2019s car\nSheldon-bot: This is delightful.\nLeonard: Uh-huh.\nSheldon-bot: It\u2019s much easier to enjoy the picturesque route we travel to work when you remove the spectre of fiery vehicular death.\nLeonard: Refresh my memory. Why didn\u2019t I just put you in the trunk?\nSheldon-bot: Because I called shotgun. Remember?\nLeonard: Right.\nSheldon-bot: You seem tense. Perhaps this will relax you.\nLeonard: I don\u2019t want to listen to music, Sheldon.\nSheldon-bot: Very well. I don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re not enjoying this. Together, in this car, with my enhanced capabilities, we\u2019re like Knight Rider.\nLeonard: Except in Knight Rider, the car isn\u2019t a yammering sphincter.\nSheldon-bot: You mock the sphincter, but the sphincter is a class of muscle without which human beings couldn\u2019t survive. There are over 50 different sphincters in the human body. How many can you name?\nLeonard: I was wrong, this is exactly like Knight Rider.\nSheldon-bot: Perhaps you\u2019d be interested in a different game.\nLeonard: No.\nSheldon-bot: This is a photograph of the 1911 Solvay Conference on the theory of radiation and quanta. Using Photoshop, I\u2019ve introduced a few anachronisms. See if you can spot all 24. I\u2019ll give you the first one. Madame Curie should not be wearing a digital watch. And go.\nLeonard: That\u2019s it. Bye-bye. (Turns off screen.)\nSheldon-bot (screen switching itself back on): Bazinga.\nLeonard: Whoa!\nSheldon-bot: I have an override switch.\nLeonard: I almost died!\nSheldon-bot : And I\u2019m safe and sound in bed. Who\u2019s crazy now?\nLeonard: I\u2019m still going to go with you.\nScene: A corridor at the university.\nSheldon-bot : Hello, Professor Hoskins. Nice to see you, Mindy. Konichi-wa Dr. Nakamora. Sorry the Swedes disproved your theory. Leonard, my door.\nLeonard: What about it?\nSheldon-bot : Be a lamb and open it for me.\nLeonard: Why? What\u2019s the problem?\nSheldon-bot : You think you have me stymied, don\u2019t you?\nLeonard: No, I think a doorknob has you stymied.\nHoward: Oh, look, it\u2019s Leonard and R2-D-Bag.\nRaj: That\u2019s my joke. I told it last night. You can\u2019t just use it.\nSheldon-bot : Raj, be a lamb and open the door for me.\nRaj: Oh, sure.\nSheldon-bot : He\u2019s a lamb. You\u2019re not.\nRaj: I\u2019m a lamb.\nScene: The Cheesecake Factory\nSheldon-bot : Isn\u2019t this nice? The pleasures of fellowship and camaraderie without having to tolerate your germy breath on my skin.\nHoward: I say we just take him to Tatooine and sell him to some Jawas.\nRaj: That\u2019s two, dude. Write your own jokes.\nPenny: Oh, great. Hi, I\u2019m Penny, I\u2019ll be your waitress.\nLeonard: Why are you introducing yourself?\nPenny: I\u2019d rather people not know I have any prior connection to you whatsoever.\nSheldon-bot : Can you tell me the specials this evening?\nPenny: Sheldon, I\u2019m not waiting on you.\nSheldon-bot: Obviously. I don\u2019t even have water yet.\nPenny: Because you\u2019re not here.\nSheldon-bot: That\u2019s discrimination against the otherwise located. I\u2019m going to have to go over your head. Manager, manager. Oh, Lord, look who it is.\nHoward: Is that Steve Wozniak?\nLeonard: I think it is.\nSheldon-bot : The Great and Powerful Woz.\nLeonard: Penny, Steve Wozniak was one of the cofounders of Apple Computer. He and Steve Jobs started it\u2026\nPenny: Yeah, I know who he is. I watch Dancing with the Stars.\nSheldon-bot : I must speak to him.\nLeonard: Of course you must.\nPenny: You know, there\u2019s an Olive Garden down the street. You guys should try it sometime.\nSheldon-bot : Excuse me, Mr. Wozniak?\nSteve Wozniak: Oh, hey. Nice virtual presence device.\nSheldon-bot : Thank you. I just want to say I\u2019m a big fan. You\u2019re my fifteenth favourite technological visionary.\nSteve Wozniak: Only fifteenth?\nSheldon-bot : It\u2019s still six spots above Steve Jobs. I care neither for turtlenecks nor showmanship.\nSteve Wozniak: Yeah, I never got that turtleneck thing.\nSheldon-bot : One of my proudest possessions is a vintage 1977 Apple Two. Despite the file system limitations of Apple DOS 3.3, it was a pretty nifty little achievement.\nSteve Wozniak: Thanks, we were shooting for nifty. You know, if you had it here, I\u2019d autograph it for you.\nSheldon-bot: Don\u2019t move for 15 to 30 minutes, depending on how the buses are running.\nSteve Wozniak: Nerds.\nScene: The hallway. Sheldon exits carrying the Apple 2.\nSheldon: I\u2019m coming, Woz, I\u2019m coming. (Trips on stairs.) Ow! Aw.\nScene: The hallway. Sheldon-bot approaches Penny\u2019s door and starts bashing into it.\nSheldon-bot : (Bash) Penny. (Bash) Penny. (Bash) Penny.\nPenny: What up, Shel-Bot?\nSheldon-bot: I can\u2019t get out of bed. I hurt my ankle.\nPenny: What do you want me to do?\nSheldon-bot: Sing me Soft Kitty.\nPenny: Really, you want me to sing Soft Kitty to a computer monitor?\nSheldon-bot: Would you rather come over and sing it to me in person?\nPenny: Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur.\nSheldon-bot: Closer to the microphone.\nPenny: Happy kitty, sleepy\u2026\nSheldon-bot: No. You have to start over.\nPenny: Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur. Happy kitty, sleepy kitty, purr, purr, purr.\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "8_1": "\n\t\t\t\tFollowing a \u201cpreviously on\u201d sequence.\nScene: A railway station. Sheldon is wearing no trousers.\nSheldon: Excuse me. Is it at all possible that you\u2019re knitting a pair of pants? Oh, well, no, you\u2019re understandably terrified. But, you know, allow me to explain. 45 days ago, um, I embarked on a railroad journey of healing because my university was making me do string theory, and my favorite comic book store burned down, and when my room mate got engaged, my girlfriend wanted to move in with me, which was no doubt a ploy just to see my, well, excuse my language, but my bathing suit parts. Uh, sir, may I use your phone?\nMan: I don\u2019t think so.\nSheldon: Yeah, well, I understand that I\u2019m half naked, but there is a reasonable explanation. While I slept in my sleeper car, all my possessions were stolen. Now, typically, I wear pyjamas, but I recently adopted a hobo lifestyle and pyjamas are the sleep-pants of the Man. I\u2019ll have you know, Mahatma Gandhi wore no pants and a nation rallied behind him. My good man, now, before you walk away, I know that I may appear deranged, but I am, in fact, a world-renowned physicist. Ask me the difference between a boson and a fermion. Go ahead, ask. Bosons have integer spin, fermions have half-integer spin. My legs are getting cold. Why won\u2019t anybody help me?\nCredits sequence. \nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: Morning.\nPenny: Hi. Want to do yoga with me?\nLeonard: Um, let me just have some coffee first, and then I\u2019ll have the strength to tell you how much I won\u2019t be doing that. (Phone rings) Hello?\nSheldon: Hello, Leonard.\nLeonard: Hey, buddy. Good to hear your voice.\nSheldon: Uh, I\u2019m in Kingman, Arizona, and, uh, I need you to come pick me up.\nLeonard: I\u2019d love to. I\u2019m just about to do yoga with Penny.\nSheldon: Leonard, I\u2019m at the police station. I was robbed. They took my phone, my wallet, my iPad, everything.\nLeonard: Oh, my God, are you okay?\nSheldon: No, I\u2019m not okay. Uh, I\u2019m wearing borrowed pants, I don\u2019t have I.D., and one of the officers here won\u2019t stop calling me chicken legs.\nLeonard: Okay. Uh, I\u2019ll, I\u2019ll come get you. What\u2019s the address?\nPenny: Hey, what\u2019s going on?\nLeonard: He got all of his stuff stolen.\nPenny: Oh.\n\u00a0\nSheldon: 2530 East Andy Devine Avenue,\nLeonard: Okay.\nSheldon: Hurry.\nLeonard: Sheldon, hang tight. Hey, do you want me to bring anything?\nSheldon: Oh, yes, please. A pair of pants. And my toothbrush. Yeah, and my mail. And a really good comeback for chicken legs, because \u201cI know you are, but what am I?\u201d was met with stony silence.\nLeonard: I\u2019ll be there as soon as I can.\nPenny: Is he okay?\nLeonard: Yeah, he\u2019s fine, he\u2019s just a little rattled.\nPenny: Oh.\nLeonard: Feel like driving to Arizona with me?\nPenny: I can\u2019t, I have that job interview.\nLeonard: Oh, right.\nPenny: Besides, I don\u2019t need six hours of your hair is different, why did you change your hair? I\u2019m holding my breath until your hair grows back.\nLeonard: All right, fine. Hey, can you think of a reason I shouldn\u2019t invite Amy to come with me?\nPenny: Nope.\nLeonard: Come on, you didn\u2019t even try.\nScene: Howard\u2019s car.\nRaj: Thanks for the lift.\nHoward: What\u2019s wrong with your car?\nRaj: I\u2019m having my windows untinted.\nHoward: Why?\nRaj: Got a hot girlfriend now. I want the haters to know.\nHoward: What are you talking about? No one\u2019s paying attention to you.\nRaj: Wow. How\u2019s that Hater-Ade taste, bro? Hey, this isn\u2019t the way to work.\nHoward: I just want to pop in and make sure Ma\u2019s okay.\nRaj: I thought Stuart was looking after her.\nHoward: He was, but now that her cast is off, he moved out. And honestly, I\u2019m kind of glad. It was getting a little weird.\nRaj: How so?\nHoward: I don\u2019t know, they\u2019re, chummy.\nRaj: Like us?\nHoward: No, not like us. Creepy chummy, like you and your dog.\nRaj: She feeds him out of her own mouth?\nHoward: I mean, he calls her Debbie, she calls him Stewie and they\u2019re all giggly around each other. And believe me, when food goes in that mouth, it does not come out.\nRaj: So are you worried because he\u2019s replacing you as a son or are you worried because he\u2019s becoming her lover?\nHoward: First of all, no one can replace me as a son. I\u2019m her little matzo ball. And secondly, my mother is well past having any kind of sex life.\nRaj: Okay, okay. Although many older women lead vibrant, active\u2026\nHoward: I said well past it.\nScene: Kingman Police Station.\nSheldon: Excuse me, Officer Hernandez? Any leads on the person who stole my belongings?\nHernandez: Not yet.\nSheldon: Well, perhaps I can help. Sherlock Holmes always says when you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth. Now, have, have you tried doing that?\nHernandez: Nope.\nSheldon: Well, maybe you should. There\u2019s lots of books called Sherlock Holmes, and there\u2019s no books called Officer Hernandez.\nScene: Leonard\u2019s car.\nLeonard: Thanks again for coming. Six hours was gonna be a long drive by myself.\nAmy: My pleasure. And I\u2019m not angry at all that my boyfriend was in trouble and called you instead of me. I love that,\nLeonard: Yeah, time\u2019s gonna fly by.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s apartment.\nPenny: I haven\u2019t been on a job interview in years. I\u2019m really nervous.\nBernadette: Don\u2019t be. You are built for pharmaceutical sales. You\u2019re cute, you\u2019re flirty and started that like there were gonna be three things.\nPenny: I don\u2019t have any experience in sales. Unless you count the bikini car wash I did in high school. But you already made me take that off my r\u00e9sum\u00e9.\nBernadette: This job is a lot like being a waitress, except instead of pushing the fish tacos \u2019cause they\u2019re about to go bad, you\u2019re just pushing our antidepressants before the FDA finds out they may cause rectal bleeding.\nPenny: They do?\nBernadette: Maybe. But like our lawyers say, the world is full of things that can cause a rectum to bleed. Anyway, I talked you up to Dan. He\u2019s the guy who\u2019ll be interviewing you.\nPenny: Oh, I really appreciate this. I just hope I\u2019m not in over my head.\nBernadette: You\u2019ll be fine. Just be yourself.\nPenny: I wish I felt more confident.\nBernadette: Penny, I wouldn\u2019t have put you up for this job if I didn\u2019t think you could handle it.\nPenny: Oh, thank you, but maybe I should cancel.\nBernadette: It\u2019s too late to cancel. You\u2019re going.\nPenny: But I don\u2019t know anything about pharmaceuticals.\nBernadette: Oh, I understand. You want to do something you\u2019re already good at. I know. Why don\u2019t I get you a job at the Sitting Around All Day Wearing Yoga Pants Factory?\nPenny: They\u2019re comfortable.\nScene: Mrs Wolowitz\u2019s house.\nHoward: Ma, I hope you\u2019re decent. Raj is here. You just started seeing naked women again, and I don\u2019t want you to be confused about where the boobs should be.\nStuart: Oh, hey, guys. What are you doing here?\nHoward: Uh, what are you doing here? I thought you moved out.\nStuart: Oh, yeah, I was going to, and then Debbie and I got to talking over dinner the other night. I didn\u2019t have any place to go, she likes having me around, so we both said, why leave? at the same time. It was precious.\nHoward: It\u2019s not that precious.\nRaj: I\u2019d like to back you up, but it sounds like it was pretty precious.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Stewie, I can\u2019t find my glasses.\nStuart: Be right there, Deb Deb. They\u2019re probably on her head.\nHoward: Or in her neck. Listen. You staying here seems like something she would\u2019ve talked to me about.\nStuart: Well, maybe if you called your mother more often, you\u2019d know.\nRaj: It wouldn\u2019t kill you to pick up the phone.\nScene: Kingman Police Station.\nSheldon: Any word on my stolen items?\nHernandez: We\u2019re doing everything we can.\nSheldon: You know, Sherlock Holmes liked to use cocaine to sharpen his focus. But I\u2019m sure those Cool Ranch Doritos are doing the trick.\nLeonard: Sheldon.\nSheldon: Leonard. Oh, I\u2019m so happy to see you.\nAmy: Are you okay?\nSheldon: Oh, I\u2019m fine. Why did you come?\nAmy: What do you mean, why did I come? You\u2019re my boyfriend. I haven\u2019t seen you in over a month. I just drove six hours to help you out. Don\u2019t you have anything to say besides why did you come?\nSheldon: I do, but, I feel uncomfortable saying it out loud in front of these police officers.\nAmy: Fine. Whisper it.\nSheldon (whispers): Shotgun.\nScene: Leonard\u2019s car.\nLeonard: So, Sheldon, tell us about your trip. Where\u2019d you go?\nSheldon: Where didn\u2019t I go? I went to New York, Chicago, Atlanta, Denver, Seattle.\nLeonard: How were they?\nSheldon: Oh, I have no idea. I never left the train station.\nLeonard: Hang on. You travelled across the entire country and never left a train station?\nSheldon: Why would I? That\u2019s where all the cool trains are.\nLeonard: I\u2019m sorry, so you never went outside?\nSheldon: Or had a single piece of fruit.\nScene: Pharmaceutical Company Office.\nDan: So, why do you think you\u2019d make a good pharmaceutical sales rep?\nPenny: Well, I\u2019m a people person. People like me. Some of my favourite people are people. I feel like I\u2019m saying people a lot. People, people, people. Okay, I\u2019m done.\nDan: You sure?\nPenny: People. Yes.\nDan: Good. So, how do you feel your previous job experience has prepared you for a career like this?\nPenny: Uh, well, as a waitress, sales was a big part of my job. I mean, believe me, I convinced a lot of very large customers, who should not be eating cheesecake, to have more cheesecake. I mean, one of those chubsters even had an insulin pump.\nDan: Uh-huh. I have an insulin pump.\nPenny: People.\nScene: Howard\u2019s car.\nHoward: It\u2019s weird, right? A grown man in his thirties living with my mother.\nRaj: That is weird. I thought he was, like, 45.\nHoward: Come on, you don\u2019t think it\u2019s a little odd?\nRaj: I don\u2019t know. I mean, she\u2019s lonely. He needs a place to stay. I doubt there\u2019s any funny business going on. And even if there was, who cares? They\u2019re both adults.\nHoward: Who cares? You wouldn\u2019t care if I slept with your mom?\nRaj: You know what? You\u2019re my best friend, and she\u2019s in a bad marriage. I give you my blessing.\nHoward: This is stupid. I\u2019m just gonna call my mother and be honest with her.\nRaj: \u2018Cause that\u2019s what little matzo balls do.\nStuart (voice on answerphone): This is Debbie.\nMrs Wolowitz (voice on answerphone): And this is Stuart.\nTogether: Just kidding.\nStuart (voice on answerphone): Leave a message.\nRaj: This is the part where you talk.\nScene: Pharmaceutical Company Office.\nDan: All right, let\u2019s say a physician was prescribing one of our competitor\u2019s drugs. How would you convince them to switch to ours?\nPenny: Um, any chance his car needs to be washed by a girl in a bikini? No. Okay, I\u2019m really sorry for wasting your time.\nDan: Don\u2019t worry about it. Thanks for stopping by.\nPenny: Okay, thanks. Um, I\u2019m sorry, listen, could you do me a favour and not tell Bernadette how badly I blew this interview? She\u2019ll get upset. And honestly I\u2019m a, a little terrified of her.\nDan: Wait, wait. You\u2019re scared of Bernadette?\nPenny: Yeah, kind of.\nDan: I thought it was just me. Everyone thinks she\u2019s so nice with that squeaky little voice.\nPenny: I know, but she\u2019s kind of a bully.\nDan: Wll, she is. I didn\u2019t even want to meet you, but, uh, I was too scared to say no to her.\nPenny: Me, too.\nDan: Yeah, yeah. One, one time, I had, I had to tell her we were cutting the, the research funding for one of the drugs she was developing.\nPenny: What happened?\nDan: I couldn\u2019t do it. She\u2019s still working on it. Oh, we\u2019re not gonna tell her about this, right?\nPenny: Oh, my God, no.\nScene: Leonard\u2019s car.\nSheldon: At the hot dog stand in the Denver train station, Heinz ketchup. At the hot dog stand in the Salt Lake City train station, Heinz ketchup. At the hot dog stand in the Indianapolis train station?\nLeonard: I don\u2019t care.\nSheldon: Wrong. Hunt\u2019s. Hey, Amy, what do you say? You ready to move on to the mustard round?\nAmy: Have you not noticed that I\u2019ve been sitting back here quietly stewing for the past two hours?\nSheldon: I just thought you were bad at the game.\nAmy: I\u2019m mad at you. How could you just go away like that without even saying good-bye, and then call Leonard for help instead of me?\nSheldon: Amy, may I please have a moment of privacy to speak with my roommate?\nAmy: We\u2019re in a moving car. What do you expect me to do? Stick my fingers in my ears?\nSheldon: Well, I was thinking put your head out the window like a dog, but that\u2019ll work. Please? This\u2019ll be quick. Leonard? As soon as we get home, I want to have coitus with Amy. Okay, she can\u2019t hear. The reason I called you is because I didn\u2019t want Amy to know I couldn\u2019t make it on my own.\nLeonard: What\u2019s the big deal?\nSheldon: Oh, of course it\u2019s no big deal to you. You idolize me, and nothing could ever knock me off that pedestal you put me on.\nLeonard: Well, yeah, it\u2019s true. You, you are a god to me.\nAmy: Can I stop now?\nLeonard: Just tell her.\nSheldon: I called Leonard because I failed. And I didn\u2019t want you to think less of me.\nAmy: You were worried about that?\nSheldon: Yes.\nAmy: Sheldon, it\u2019s okay with me that you\u2019re not perfect.\nSheldon: Can I have one more moment with Leonard?\nAmy: Sure.\nSheldon: Amy just hurt my feelings. I want to break up with her.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s apartment.\nHoward: Now, I never thought I\u2019d say this, but I\u2019m kind of excited to see Sheldon.\nBernadette: I never thought I\u2019d say this, but Penny got a job today.\nHoward: She did?\nBernadette: Well, the only reason she got it is \u2019cause the guy who interviewed her loves me.\nHoward (answering a knock on the door): What do you want?\nStuart: I, uh, kind of got the feeling you might not be okay with me staying at your mom\u2019s.\nHoward: You\u2019re right, I\u2019m not. I think it\u2019s weird.\nBernadette: Howie?\nHoward: It is. He\u2019s a grown man. He\u2019s just gonna live there rent-free? How is that gonna motivate him to get off his butt and get a job? I mean, do you even have a plan?\nStuart: Hey, you\u2019re not my father, okay? And besides, your mother and I were talking\u2026\nHoward: Your mother and I? You\u2019re not my father.\nStuart: I didn\u2019t say I was your father.\nHoward: Well, I didn\u2019t say I was your father.\nBernadette: Okay, calm down. You\u2019re not his father, he\u2019s not your father. Nobody\u2019s anybody\u2019s father.\nStuart: I, I\u2019m sorry you don\u2019t like my life choices, but it\u2019s my life.\nHoward: Well, it\u2019s my house, it\u2019s my rules.\nStuart: Oh, oh, okay, Dad, if I mow the lawn, can I have my allowance?\nBernadette: Hey, don\u2019t you take that sarcastic tone with him.\nStuart: I don\u2019t have to listen to you.\nHoward: Don\u2019t talk to her like that. That is my mother. Wife. My wife. I said my wife.\nStuart: You know what? This isn\u2019t getting us anywhere. When you\u2019re ready to apologize, you know where to find me.\nHoward: Yeah, in my house.\nStuart: That\u2019s right, sucka.\nScene: The stairwell. \nSheldon: I wish I\u2019d never gone on that trip. I feel no better now than when I left.\nAmy: But you still accomplished something.\nLeonard: Yeah. If you had told anyone that you were going away on a train by yourself across the country, do you know what they would have said?\nSheldon: That I couldn\u2019t do it?\nLeonard: Exactly. Right after they said yeah.\nAmy: But you did do it. So what if it didn\u2019t all go your way? That\u2019s what makes it an adventure.\nSheldon: That\u2019s a good point. You know, I\u2019m a lot like Gandalf the Grey. He fought the Balrog and emerged stronger than ever as Gandalf the White. I was robbed of my phone and pants, and I, too, came back stronger. And whiter, too, \u2019cause I wasn\u2019t in direct sunlight for six weeks.\nAmy: See? This trip was good for you.\nSheldon: Indeed. I was the world\u2019s smartest caterpillar. And then after pupating in our nation\u2019s railway system, I\u2019ve burst forth as the world\u2019s smartest butterfly.\nLeonard: Butterfly could\u2019ve gotten himself home from Arizona.\nSheldon: Yeah, I feel renewed. I\u2019m ready to deal with any changes that come my way.\nAll: Hey.\nPenny: Hey, look who\u2019s back.\nSheldon: Your hair is different. You changed your hair. I can\u2019t take this. I\u2019m out.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Would you like to see pictures from my trip?\nPenny: I thought your phone got stolen.\nSheldon: Yeah, it did, but luckily all my photos got backed up to the Cloud.\nLeonard: And you thought they all had a silver lining.\nSheldon: Here, day one, uh, this was the seat I was going to sit in but didn\u2019t because there were cracker crumbs on it. As it was first class, I suspect Ritz. This is the train bathroom. This is the Imodium I took so I would never have to use the train bathroom.\nPenny: I cannot believe you travelled the entire country and never left the train station.\nSheldon: I know. You know, I almost died in a fire in Des Moines, but I stayed put. FYI, that\u2019s when the Imodium gave out.\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "5_12": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The apartment.\nHoward: Completely empty box. If you\u2019d like to examine it?\nLeonard: Mm-hmm. Yep. I see nothing in this box but a wasted childhood.\nHoward: Little snarky there, cello lessons. And we have this completely ordinary cylinder. If you\u2019d like to examine it?\nRaj: Ordinary, yet I sense it is dripping with magical potential.\nSheldon: Oh, dear Lord. A man pops out for a moment to evacuate his bowels and catch up on the adventures of the Caped Crusader, only to emerge and discover his apartment has been transformed into a cabaret.\nLeonard: Sheldon, he\u2019s just practising for his cousin\u2019s birthday party.\nHoward: As I was saying, empty box, empty cylinder, and, ooh, voila. (Pulls out a goldfish in a jar)\nRaj: I\u2019m telling you, dude, there\u2019s a seat on the Hogwarts Express with your name on it.\nSheldon: This is how you\u2019re going to entertain your little cousin and his friends? By lying to them?\nHoward: How is this lying?\nSheldon: A magic show is an inherently deceitful proposition. This is an ordinary top hat. You\u2019ve chosen that card freely. I do not have a set of lock picks lodged in my keister.\nRaj: Can\u2019t you just enjoy the wonder, Sheldon? Why must you peek behind the curtain? Or up the butt?\nSheldon: If we poison the critical thinking faculties of children by telling them that rabbits come out of hats, then we create adults who believe in astrology and homeopathy and that Ryan Reynolds was a better choice for Green Lantern than lovable rogue Nathan Fillion.\nLeonard: Sheldon, he\u2019s just gonna do a few magic tricks for some kids. I really don\u2019t think they\u2019re gonna end up liking the Green Lantern movie.\nHoward: Don\u2019t be so hard on him. It\u2019s natural to be a little cranky when you have a quarter in your ear!\nSheldon: Coins lodged in body parts is not a source of amusement. When I was five, Billy Sparks put a Mexican peso up my nose.\nHoward: How is that not amusing?\nSheldon: It\u2019s still there. Takes me 45 minutes to get through airport security. (Storms out)\nHoward: Look, I made Sheldon disappear. Ta-da.\nLeonard: Next time, you should open with that.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The Cheesecake Factory.\nPenny: Ooh, look who\u2019s out on a date. Pasadena\u2019s favourite power couple, Shamy.\nSheldon: And that is the answer to the question, what is wrong with eating at The Cheesecake Factory?\nPenny: So, are we celebrating anything special tonight?\nAmy: Oh, yes. Our relationship agreement specifies that the second Thursday of every month, or the third Thursday in a month with five Thursdays, is date night.\nPenny: That is so hot.\nSheldon: All right, without objection, the minutes of the previous date are considered read and agreed to. Any new business?\nAmy: How was your day?\nSheldon: Superb. This morning I made a palindrome with my Alpha-Bits. Nice hat, Bob Tahecin.\nAmy: Sounds like you hit the ground running. I have a bit of good news myself. My most recent paper on how a cooperative long-term potentiation can map memory sequences in dendritic branches made the cover of Neuron.\nSheldon: Ooh! Speaking of good news, somebody just hit 100 Twitter followers.\nAmy: That\u2019s nice. Anyway, I\u2019ve been dreaming of this day for a long time.\nSheldon: Yeah, me, too. Triple digits, I\u2019m not gonna lie, feels pretty good.\nAmy: Sheldon, I\u2019m the sole author on a paper being published in a distinguished journal that may change the course of my field.\nSheldon: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Ooh, 101! Air\u2019s getting a bit thin up here.\nPenny: So, are we ready to order?\nAmy: Give me a minute. I\u2019m gonna go wash up.\nSheldon: Well, that\u2019s odd. We both washed up when we came in. It\u2019s probably a euphemism for urination.\nPenny: Sheldon, what is wrong with you?\nSheldon: Not much. Although, I can be faulted for being overly fond of koala bears. I don\u2019t know what it is, when they smart munching on eucalyptus, I just melt inside.\nPenny: Okay, Amy just told you some exciting news, and you acted like it was no big deal.\nSheldon: Oh, I see why you\u2019re confused. No, her news sounded important, but what you\u2019re forgetting is, it was an achievement in the field of biology. That\u2019s all about yucky, squishy things.\nPenny: Honey, she\u2019s upset. You\u2019re her boyfriend. You have to at least try to be excited by the things she\u2019s excited by.\nSheldon: What if they simply don\u2019t excite me?\nPenny: Well, just smile and think about koalas.\nSheldon: She\u2019d see right through that. We go to the zoo all the time. She knows my koala face. And for future reference, it\u2019s this.\nScene: Howard\u2019s bedroom.\nBernadette: Oh, you have a lot of magic stuff.\nHoward: Yeah. I started when I was a teenager. I thought I could show a girl a few tricks and invite her up to my bedroom to see the rest of the act.\nBernadette: Did it work?\nHoward: Ah, let\u2019s just say the only wand that ever saw any action was this one. Oh, look what my mom made us for the act.\nBernadette: Ooh. I like the fabric. Where\u2019d she get it?\nHoward: Well, she cut up one of her old bathing suits. She made these two vests and half a dozen napkins.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Has she tried on the vest yet?\nHoward: I just gave it to her!\nMrs Wolowitz (off): I hope it fits, she has a tricky figure! She\u2019s short and stacked, like me!\nHoward: She\u2019s not stacked like you, Ma! She never steps on hers!\nBernadette: Listen, Howie, maybe I\u2019m not the best choice to be a magician\u2019s assistant.\nHoward: You\u2019ll do fine. Hand me those rings? See? You nailed it.\nBernadette: You know, i-it\u2019s just that I\u2019m not that comfortable with little kids.\nHoward: Well, that\u2019s because you haven\u2019t been around them much. This is good practice. I mean, you are gonna be a mom someday, right?\nBernadette: Mmm, yeah, sure.\nHoward: Oh-ho-ho! I haven\u2019t seen this trick in years. It\u2019s called the dove pan. You let everyone see the pan is empty, but there\u2019s a secret compartment in the lid. And then you open it and produce a live\u2026 Don\u2019t look in there.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: Oh, a little Red Dead Redemption, huh?\nSheldon: Yes.\nLeonard: How come you\u2019re not doing a mission? You\u2019re just wandering around.\nSheldon: Had a rough night. I thought I\u2019d go for a walk and clear my head.\nLeonard: Some people go outside and do that.\nSheldon: It\u2019s after nine o\u2019clock, at this hour the streets of Pasadena are teeming with drunken sailors and alley cats.\nLeonard: You want to talk about it?\nSheldon: No. I think I\u2019ll just go in this saloon and drink my troubles away.\nLeonard: You know digital alcohol is never a solution. What\u2019s going on?\nSheldon: Hard as this may be to believe, it\u2019s possible that I\u2019m not boyfriend material.\nLeonard: Glad I was sitting down for that. Did you and Amy get in a fight?\nSheldon: Amy had a fight. I was being perfectly reasonable. I\u2019m gonna have a whiskey. Do you want anything?\nLeonard: No, I can\u2019t. I\u2019m playing Grand Theft Auto later. Look, I\u2019m no expert in women.\nSheldon: I\u2019ll say.\nLeonard: That\u2019s not necessary when someone\u2019s trying to help you.\nSheldon: I\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s the alcohol talking. Go on.\nLeonard: Sometimes with women you want to listen to what upsets them and then show them that you can grow and change.\nSheldon: Nuts to that. What else you got?\nLeonard: I don\u2019t know what to tell you. Buy her something.\nSheldon: How does that work?\nLeonard: Well, you skip over any attempt to repair your emotional connection and you win back her affection with an empty financial gesture.\nSheldon: Well, that approach has Sheldon Cooper written all over it.\nLeonard: Glad I could help.\nSheldon: It\u2019s appreciated. And if you ever manage to find a woman again, I\u2019ll be glad to return the favour.\nScene: The birthday party.\nHoward: And now, all the rings are magically linked together. My fiancee\u2019s wearing a magic ring, too. It made all my money disappear.\nBernadette: Oh, ah, right. (Bangs drum and cymbal) And now, the great Howdini\u2019s next miraculous illusion.\nChild: When are we gonna have cake?\nBernadette: After you\u2019ve been thoroughly amazed.\nChild: But we want cake now.\nBernadette: Well, you\u2019re not getting cake right now, capisce?\nHoward: Okay. Okay. Now, my lovely assistant is going to bring me an ordinary pitcher of milk.\nSecond child: I know how you do that trick.\nBernadette: Do you know how to pipe down?\nHoward: Okay, we\u2019re going to roll up this newspaper.\nSecond child: It\u2019s a fake pitcher.\nBernadette: You got wax in your ears? The man said it\u2019s an ordinary pitcher. Howdini.\nHoward: Okay, we\u2019re going to stick this in here (puts newspaper into trouser waistband) and then I\u2019m going to pour in the milk. I hope this works, because I didn\u2019t bring a change of pants.\nSecond child: Look, I Googled it. It\u2019s a fake pitcher.\nBernadette: That\u2019s it. No cake for you. Anyone else want to join the No Cake Club?\nHoward: She\u2019s just kidding, boys and girls. Everyone gets cake.\nBernadette: Not him.\nHoward: Just give me the pitcher. Behold! Wrong pitcher.\nScene: Bernadette\u2019s car.\nBernadette: I told you I\u2019m not good with kids.\nHoward: Yes, you did. Oh, I think my crotch is starting to curdle.\nBernadette: The thing is, my mother worked full-time. I had to take care of my brothers and sisters.\nHoward: Yeah, so?\nBernadette: Ugh, it was horrible. With their snotty noses and their poopy diapers and their little shrieky voices, always complaining. I don\u2019t want to get dressed. Joey keeps spitting in my mouth. This isn\u2019t the way Mom makes waffles. Well, okay, put your hand in here. Let\u2019s see how you like this waffle!\nHoward: All right, settle down. Red light. Red light, red light! Okay, we\u2019re fine.\nBernadette: I\u2019m sorry. I know it makes me sound like a bad person, but I just don\u2019t like children.\nHoward: Yeah, no, we all got that. But don\u2019t you think it\u2019ll be different when the child is ours?\nBernadette: Right, when it\u2019s our kid that\u2019s ruined my body and kept me up all night and I\u2019ve got no career and no future and nothing to be happy about for the next 20 years, sure, that\u2019ll be completely different.\nHoward: Well, yeah.\nScene: A jewellery store.\nSheldon: I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything in this jewellery store that Amy would appreciate more than the humidifier we were just looking at at Sears.\nPenny: Oh, my God, now I know what I sound like to you when I say stupid stuff.\nSheldon: Ooh, a pocket watch.\nPenny: Okay, I don\u2019t think Amy wants a pocket watch.\nSheldon: No, but maybe she wants a man with a pocket watch.\nPenny: Still saying stupid stuff. Ooh, does she like bracelets?\nSheldon: Well, she\u2019s very fond of her silver one that says allergic to penicillin. Maybe they have a dressier version of that?\nAssistant: Well, how are we doing this afternoon? Are we looking for anything special? Perhaps a ring for the lady?\nPenny: (Snorts) Trust me, we are not a couple.\nSheldon: Excuse me. I don\u2019t see why you get to snort derisively and point that out. You\u2019d be lucky to land a fella like me.\nPenny: Fine, go ahead.\nSheldon: (Snorts) Trust me, we are not a couple.\nAssistant: My apologies. How can I help you today?\nPenny: He\u2019s in trouble with his girlfriend and needs to buy her a present.\nAssistant: Great, trouble with girlfriends is what\u2019s putting my daughter through USC.\nPenny: Ooh, are these real diamonds?\nAssistant: Yes. Channel set baguettes, 20 points total weight.\nSheldon: Remarkable. Diamonds, crystallized carbon. Every day, people go to the grocery store and come home with sacks full of carbon in the form of charcoal briquettes that they toss in their barbeques and set on fire. But just because you\u2019ve got some carbon with the atoms stacked neatly, you expect me to plunk down thousands of dollars.\nAssistant: Actually, that\u2019s only 750. Everything\u2019s on sale.\nSheldon: Really. Talk to me about that pocket watch.\nScene: The apartment. The guys are playing Donkey Kong Jenga.\nHoward: I\u2019m still trying to wrap my mind around it. I always thought I\u2019d be a dad someday.\nRaj: Oh, me, too. You\u2019re so caring. I\u2019ve often pictured you guiding a young boy into manhood.\nLeonard: There you go, Howard. Sounds like Raj\u2019ll have your babies, problem solved.\nRaj: Hey, just because a man shows caring for another man doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s displaying the love that dare not speak its name. Did she definitely say she didn\u2019t want kids?\nHoward: Yeah, she doesn\u2019t like them. And from what I saw, the feeling was mutual.\nLeonard: What are you gonna do?\nHoward: I don\u2019t know. I can\u2019t see a life where I don\u2019t have kids. I mean, people have kids. I mean, even Donkey Kong had Donkey Kong Jr. So he could teach someone how to kidnap princesses and throw barrels at Italian plumbers.\nLeonard: You know, there\u2019s no guarantee even if you have kids that you\u2019re going to like them.\nRaj: Wow, that\u2019s rough. Where\u2019d you get that?\nLeonard: It\u2019s right off the dust jacket of my mom\u2019s last book.\nHoward: Maybe me and Bernadette aren\u2019t right for each other.\nLeonard: Look, Howard, I\u2019d say there\u2019s a lot of fish in the sea, but I watched you dangle your hook in the water for years. Do not throw her back.\nHoward: I don\u2019t want to, but this is kind of a deal breaker.\nRaj: What\u2019s your mom going to say if you call off the wedding?\nHoward: Huh, it\u2019ll kill her. On the other hand, if I don\u2019t give her grandchildren, that\u2019ll kill her, too. So, either way, on the Mom front, I\u2019m golden.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment.\nSheldon: What time did you tell Amy to be here?\nPenny: Eight o\u2019clock. (Sheldon checks pocket watch) Sheldon, that pocket watch is ridiculous.\nSheldon: Nonsense. I look like a train conductor. Under what pretext did you lure her here?\nPenny: I said, hey, want to come over and hang out?\nSheldon: Good, good, if you had said something clever, she might\u2019ve gotten suspicious.\nAmy: Hey.\nPenny: Hi.\nAmy: What\u2019s he doing here?\nPenny: Okay, he wants to talk to you.\nAmy: Well, I don\u2019t want to talk to him. And I\u2019m pretty disappointed in you, too. Although we both know that won\u2019t last.\nPenny: Sheldon, you\u2019re up.\nSheldon: Thank you. Amy, I\u2019d like to apologize. Your accomplishment was impressive. And I\u2019m proud of you.\nAmy: We both know that\u2019s your koala face.\nSheldon: I told you.\nPenny: Okay, look, he bought you this.\nAmy: Jewellery? Seriously? Sheldon, you are the most shallow, self-centred person I have ever met. Do you really think another transparently manip..oh! It\u2019s a tiara! A tiara! I have a tiara! Put it on me, put it on me, put it on me, put it on me, put it on me, put it on me, put it on me.\nPenny: You look beautiful.\nAmy: Of course I do, I\u2019m a princess, and this is my tiara!\nSheldon: You\u2019re right, the tiara was too much.\nScene: Howard\u2019s bedroom.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Howard! Bernadette\u2019s\u2026 Oh, she slipped right by me.\nBernadette: Here\u2019s your vest back.\nHoward: You should keep it. You could wear it again sometime.\nBernadette: Where?\nHoward: I don\u2019t know, hunting?\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Don\u2019t forget to talk to her about this mishegas where I don\u2019t get grandkids!\nHoward: Don\u2019t worry, Ma. I will, as soon as I can figure out a way to bring up such a sensitive issue!\nBernadette: I guess you talked to your mom, huh?\nHoward: I was upset. My mom can be a pretty good shoulder to cry on, if the smell of Bengay doesn\u2019t burn your eyes.\nBernadette: Look, it\u2019s obvious having kids is really important to you, and I think I came up with a solution.\nHoward: Really? That\u2019s great. What?\nBernadette: Well, seeing as how I make way more money than you anyway, what if I work and you stay home with the kids?\nHoward: Me?\nBernadette: Yeah. You know, you\u2019ll watch Barney and pull Cheerios out of their noses and go on play dates, and I\u2019ll work and have conversations with people my own age and enjoy my life.\nHoward: Yeah.\nBernadette: Yay, so we\u2019re good.\nHoward: Yeah, we\u2019re good.\nBernadette: You know, I don\u2019t know if this counted as a fight, but how about some make-up sex?\nHoward: I would love that.

Please say something.\nSheldon: Leonard, prepare to be humbled and weep at the glory of my genius.\nLeonard: Nope, it was better before.\nSheldon: Look at it. I feel like my mind just made a baby. And it\u2019s beautiful. It\u2019s not like human babies, which are loud and covered in goop.\nLeonard: Holy crap, Sheldon, did you just figure out a method for synthesizing a new stable super-heavy element?\nSheldon: Did I? Well, that can\u2019t be right. No one\u2019s ever done that before. Except me, because I just did it. Sheldon and his brain, yeah. Sheldon and his brain, yeah. Sheldon and his brain, yeah. Sheldon and his brain, yeah. Sheldon and his brain\u2026\nLeonard: Yeah, definitely better before.\nScene: The cafeteria.\nHoward: So I\u2019m almost done writing the song for Bernadette. Are you cool playing the cello?\nLeonard: If by cool you mean willing to, yes. If by cool you mean cool, clearly you\u2019ve never seen me play the cello.\nHoward: Great. Will you play the ukulele?\nRaj: Of course. I\u2019d be happy to shred it on my ax.\nHoward: Or you could just play your tiny, ridiculous guitar.\nRaj: Fine. I will melt her heart. And her face.\nSheldon: Gentlemen. Uh, no doubt you heard about my little breakthrough. Now, if your plan is to hoist me on your shoulders and carry me around the cafeteria, please refrain. I don\u2019t care for heights, motion sickness or the thought of your necks touching my buttocks. \nHoward: Seriously, congratulations, Sheldon.\nRaj: Yeah, I read your paper online. That technique for creating a new heavy element is inspired.\nSheldon: Oh, well, thank you. Believe it or not, I just learned a Chinese research team at the Hubei Institute for Nuclear Physics ran a test on a cyclotron, and the results were extremely promising.\nLeonard: Sheldon, that\u2019s incredible.\nSheldon: Yeah, I know. They called it the greatest thing since the Communist party. Although I\u2019m pretty sure that the Communist party made them say that. I like China. See, they know how to keep people in line.\nHoward: So, what happens next?\nSheldon: Oh, more testing, more success, more fame. Yeah, but don\u2019t worry, I will remain the same down-to-earth humble Joe I\u2019ve always been.\nLeonard: Good to know.\nSheldon: Now give me that cookie, I discovered an element.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment. \nPenny: Thank you so much for coming.\nRaj: You called the right person. I believe I have the perfect romantic evening for you to give Leonard.\nPenny: Okay, good, \u2019cause I\u2019ve been really struggling with this.\nRaj: As I\u2019m sure you\u2019re aware, the quickest way to a man\u2019s heart is through his\u2026\nPenny: Pants, but Leonard says sex doesn\u2019t count.\nRaj: Oh. You poor thing. You have one arrow in your quiver, and you just can\u2019t use it. Fortunately, another pathway to a man\u2019s heart is through his stomach. \nPenny: I don\u2019t know if I want to cook for him. He\u2019s kind of a picky eater. I mean, it\u2019s too salty, it\u2019s too dry, it\u2019s too burnt and frozen at the same time. Okay, come on, what else would sweep you off your feet?\nRaj: Well, I\u2019ve always had this fantasy that involves dancing. The sexual chemistry between my partner and me is electric. But boy, oh, boy, does my father not approve until he sees us in the big dance competition.\nPenny: Okay, that\u2019s just the plot for Dirty Dancing. What else would you love? Other than being lifted over Patrick Swayze\u2019s head.\nRaj: Oh, oh, uh, you could, uh, stand outside his window with a boom box in the air.\nPenny: That\u2019s from Say Anything.\nRaj: Look, I\u2019m a lonely guy, I watch a lot of movies. Look, Penny, if you truly want to be romantic, it needs to come from you.\nPenny: I get that, but why is this so hard?\nRaj: Well, you\u2019ve probably never had to do this stuff \u2019cause you\u2019re young and beautiful and men have always thrown themselves at you.\nPenny: Yeah, I\u2019m trying to be sad about that. I can\u2019t.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Let\u2019s see, what\u2019s next? Okay, here. This is the Magic Marker I was using when I made the discovery.\nAmy: I don\u2019t think the Smithsonian\u2019s gonna want your marker. \nSheldon: And that\u2019s why you\u2019re not on a list for my tree fort. Ooh, guess who\u2019s getting an article written about him in Physics Today? I\u2019ll give you a hint. You measured the diameter of his suspicious mole yesterday.\nAmy: Sheldon, I\u2019m so proud of you.\nSheldon: Well, you should be. My discovery is spreading like wildfire. Unlike my mole, which is holding steady at the size of a navy bean.\nAmy: What\u2019s next?\nSheldon: This is the very copy of The Handbook of Chemistry and Physics in which I looked up the reaction rates of mendelevium and\u2026\nAmy: And what?\nSheldon: No. No, no, no, no.\nAmy: What\u2019s wrong?\nSheldon: I\u2019ve made a horrible mistake.\nAmy: What are you talking about?\nSheldon: This table, it\u2019s in square centimetres. I read it as square metres. You know what that means?\nAmy: That Americans can\u2019t handle the metric system?\nSheldon: Amy, I was off by a factor of 10,000. \nAmy: But the Chinese team found the element.\nSheldon: Yeah, well, they shouldn\u2019t have. My calculations were wrong. There must be some resonance between the elements I didn\u2019t know about.\nAmy: So you just got lucky?\nSheldon: Sheldon Cooper does not get lucky.\nAmy: You and me both, brother. It doesn\u2019t matter. The element was found because of you, and that\u2019s groundbreaking.\nSheldon: What matters is the greatest scientific achievement of my life is based on a blunder. I\u2019m not a genius, I\u2019m a fraud.\nAmy: You know, Sheldon, in neuroscience, we\u2019re forever finding something in one part of the brain that we thought was someplace else.\nSheldon: Oh, great. Now I\u2019m worse than a fraud. I\u2019m practically a biologist.\nScene: Leonard\u2019s car.\nLeonard:: You got to stop beating yourself up over this. I mean, you made a mistake, but it was a happy mistake.\nSheldon: There\u2019s nothing happy about it. I\u2019m being given credit that I don\u2019t deserve. \nLeonard: Oh, people get things they don\u2019t deserve all the time. Look at me with you. \nSheldon: No, Leonard, this is going to haunt me for the rest of my life. Every science classroom, every periodic table, every textbook, this mistake will be staring back at me. Like that time you let Koothrappali wax your eyebrows. I\u2019ve got to find a way to stop this thing.\nLeonard: Buddy, I don\u2019t think you can. I mean, once it\u2019s out there, it\u2019s out there. This thing is like the science equivalent of a sex tape.\nSheldon: You know, frankly, I\u2019d prefer a sex tape.\nLeonard: You don\u2019t know what a sex tape is, do you?\nSheldon: No.\nScene: The cafeteria.\nHoward: Make sure you guys get to the restaurant by eight. Bernadette\u2019s meeting me there at eight thirty and I don\u2019t want to blow the surprise.\nLeonard: We\u2019ll be there.\nRaj: Got it. Now, uh, I have a question about the song. I was thinking at some point I could bust out a little rap.\nHoward: E-Ni-Ni-Ni-Ni-No.\nRaj: Come on, come on, you haven\u2019t even heard it yet. Leonard, give me a beat.\nLeonard: I will not.\nRaj: Oh, please?\nHoward: No, I want this to be romantic.\nRaj: It will be. I don\u2019t call anyone a ho, and the only time I use the phrase my bitch, I\u2019m referring to you.\nVoice: There he is. (General applause) \nSheldon: Stop it. Stop celebrating me.\nVoice: Woo!\nSheldon: And no woos. Oh, not you, Dr. Woo. You\u2019re fine. I want you all to know that you have no reason to applaud me. My so-called breakthrough wasn\u2019t the result of my genius. It was nothing more than a boneheaded mistake. So please refrain from praising me for it in the future.\nRaj: Wait, I don\u2019t understand. They didn\u2019t find the element?\nSheldon: Oh, no, they found the element. (More applause) No, no, stop it. I don\u2019t need to take this admiration from the likes of you people. How do I make them stop loving me?\nLeonard: Invite them to live with us.\nScene: A restaurant.\nPenny: Boy, Bernadette is gonna love this.\nLeonard: Yeah. It must be nice to have someone do something so romantic.\nPenny: Okay, you know what\u2019s not romantic? Rubbing it in someone\u2019s face.\nLeonard: Actually, it can be, but I told you sex doesn\u2019t count.\nHoward: I\u2019m getting worried about Bernadette. I\u2019m gonna call and check on her.\nSheldon: The National Science Foundation wants to give me a substantial grant.\nRaj: Oh, that\u2019s a big deal.\nSheldon: I know. When will this nightmare end?\nLeonard: Hey, I get that you feel bad about all the attention, but still, what you did is amazing. We\u2019re really proud of you.\nAmy: I\u2019m not.\nSheldon: You\u2019re not?\nAmy: Sheldon, I\u2019ve been thinking about it, and you\u2019re right. You don\u2019t deserve any credit. All you did was misread some numbers on a table. A very easy table, too. Honestly, I\u2019m embarrassed for you.\nSheldon: That\u2019s the most romantic thing I\u2019ve ever heard.\nPenny: Damn it, everyone\u2019s better at this than me.\nSheldon: Congratulations, Dr. Fowler. You just made the fort.\nHoward: Guys, there was an accident at Bernie\u2019s lab.\nLeonard: Oh, my God, is she okay?\nHoward: Yeah, but she\u2019s at the hospital in quarantine.\nPenny: What?\nAmy: Poor Bernadette.\nLeonard: Oh, no.\nSheldon: I hate to pile on the bad news, but I just got a raise.\nScene: The hospital. \nHoward: Oh, my God, Bernie, what happened?\nBernadette: Well, let\u2019s just say the next time you move a dozen vials of raccoon virus to the fridge, make two trips. \nHoward: You\u2019re sure you\u2019re okay?\nBernadette: Yeah, it\u2019s just a precaution. If there was a problem, I\u2019d be throwing up out of my eyeballs by now. Sorry I messed up our date.\nHoward: Oh, don\u2019t worry about it. I brought the date here. Guys, come on in.\nBernadette: What\u2019s all this?\nHoward: Well, tonight is the anniversary of our first date, and I wanted to celebrate it by writing a song for you.\nBernadette: Howie.\nAmy: Sheldon, get over here.\nSheldon: She might be contagious. Don\u2019t you think I\u2019m having a rough enough day?\nAmy: Sheldon.\nHoward (singing): If I didn\u2019t have you, life would be blue, I\u2019d be Dr. Who without the TARDIS.\nSheldon: Is it me, or does she not look so good?\nAmy: Shh.\nHoward: A candle without a wick, a Watson without a Crick, I\u2019d be one of my outfits without a dick-ie. I\u2019d be cheese without the mac, Jobs without the Wozniak, I\u2019d be solving exponential equations that use bases not found on your calculator making it much harder to crack. I\u2019d be an atom without a bomb, a dot without the com, and I\u2019d probably still live with my mom.\nAll: And he\u2019d probably still live with his mom.\nHoward: Ever since I met you, you turned my world around. You supported all my dreams and all my hopes. You\u2019re like uranium-235 and I\u2019m uranium-238, almost inseparable isotopes. I couldn\u2019t have imagined how good my life would get from the moment that I met you Bernadette.\nBernadette: Oh, Howie.\nHoward: If I didn\u2019t have you life would be dreary, I\u2019d be string theory without any string. I\u2019d be binary code without a one, a cathode ray tube without an electron gun. I\u2019d be Firefly, Buffy and Avengers without Joss Whedon. I\u2019d speak a lot more Klingon, Heghlu\u2019meH QaQ jajvam. \nAll: And he\u2019d definitely still live with his mom.\nHoward: Ever since I met you, you turned my world around. You\u2019re my best friend and my lover. We\u2019re like changing electric and magnetic fields. You can\u2019t have one without the other. I couldn\u2019t have imagined how good my life would get from the moment that I met you, Bernadette.\nAll: Oh, we couldn\u2019t have imagined how good our lives would get from the moment that we met you, Bernadette.\nBernadette: Howie, that was amazing. Look, I\u2019m shaking.\nSheldon: She\u2019s sick, I knew it. Bye.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment. \nLeonard: I have to say, this is the best Top Ramen you\u2019ve ever made.\nPenny: I discovered a secret ingredient. The flavour packet. That sucker is well named. All right, lover boy, get ready, \u2019cause there is a crap storm of romance coming your way.\nLeonard: Stop it, you\u2019re gonna make me cry. All right. You seem pretty confident.\nPenny: Oh, I am. Maybe if you follow this trail, you\u2019ll see why.\nLeonard: Oh, rose petals.\nPenny: Yes. The most beautiful and shockingly expensive of all the flowers.\nLeonard: You made the bed? You really are pulling out all the stops.\nPenny: Okay, I gave this a lot of thought, and I finally found something to show you how much I love you.\nLeonard: Oh, wow.\nPenny: It\u2019s a first edition of Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy. I remember it was your favourite book growing up.\nLeonard: This is great. It, thank you, it\u2019s, so much.\nPenny: What?\nLeonard: Nothing. I love it.\nPenny: No. Something\u2019s going on. What\u2019s wrong with it? I remember you saying how great it would be to have a first edition.\nLeonard: It\u2019s true, I did. I did say that. When we were at the used bookstore together and I saw the first edition and I bought it.\nPenny: Oh, my God, I am the worst.\nLeonard: No, no, it\u2019s okay. It\u2019s really thoughtful.\nPenny: No, it\u2019s not. I mean, what\u2019s thoughtful is everything you do. Here, you know what? Look at this. Look, here\u2019s the, the plane ticket you bought me when I was too poor to go home for the holidays. And the rose you left on my windshield just because. Here\u2019s the, the thank-you letter you wrote me after the first time I slept with you. All 11 pages of it.\nLeonard: I can\u2019t believe you saved all this stuff.\nPenny: Of course I did. It\u2019s you.\nLeonard: Come here.\nPenny: Oh.\nLeonard: Is that a pregnancy test?\nPenny: Oh, yeah, just the first one. I didn\u2019t save them all.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: I can\u2019t believe I read this table wrong. I blame you.\nAmy: Me? What did I do?\nSheldon: You distract me. I\u2019ve been distracted since the moment I met you. \nAmy: Sorry.\nSheldon: Well, you should be. Because all I can think about is how much I want to kiss you. And not just on the cheek, but on the mouth. Like mommies and daddies do.\nAmy: Oh, Sheldon.\nSheldon (not in Amy\u2019s daydream, now in the Cheesecake Factory): Amy? Amy? Did you hear what I said?\nAmy: Can\u2019t talk, in the zone.\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "9_2": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Why are you up?\nLeonard: How am I supposed to sleep? I\u2019ve been married less than 24 hours, and my wife isn\u2019t speaking to me.\nSheldon: Perhaps you can think of this n a more positive light. In one day, you\u2019ve managed to do what it takes many couples decades to achieve.\nPenny (entering): Hi.\nLeonard: Hey.\nPenny: You couldn\u2019t sleep either?\nLeonard: Of course not.\nSheldon: Me neither. But I just had a tickle in my throat, not profound marital problems.\nLeonard: What are we gonna do?\nPenny: I don\u2019t know.\nLeonard: Please, tell me how I can fix it.\nSheldon: Glad you asked. As I see it, there\u2019s a simple solution. Your lips had a dalliance with the lips of another woman. It seems only logical that to restore balance to the relationship, you should find another man and dally with him. And by dally, I mean some hardcore mouth-on-mouth action.\nLeonard: Okay, that is the stupidest thing I\u2019ve ever heard.\nPenny: Actually, I think he\u2019s onto something.\nLeonard: You can\u2019t be serious. \u2018Cause I messed up and made out with a girl, you\u2019re gonna do the same with a random guy?\nSheldon: I\u2019m currently single.\nPenny: That\u2019s true. You are.\nLeonard: What is happening?\nSheldon: I will tell you what is happening. I am saving my best friend\u2019s marriage.\nLeonard (waking up): U-u-u-uh!\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The apartment.\nAmy (on skype): Sheldon, I don\u2019t think you understand how being broken up works. The only way I can sort through my feelings is if there is space between us. Every time I see you, it re-traumatizes me. I go through the pain all over again.\nSheldon: Well, hello to you, too.\nAmy: What do you want?\nSheldon: I understand we\u2019re no longer a couple, but I would like to remind you that we made a baby together.\nAmy: What baby?\nSheldon: A precocious little Internet show known as Fun With Flags.\nAmy: I\u2019m hanging up.\nSheldon: Great. See you in about half an hour.\nAmy: Sheldon, I am not doing Fun With Flags with you.\nSheldon: Why not?\nAmy: Because we\u2019re broken up.\nSheldon: Sonny and Cher made it work. Their variety show kept going long after the divorce, and here we are still talking about them.\nAmy: No one\u2019s talking about Sonny and Cher.\nSheldon: You must be thinking about Donny and Marie, \u2019cause you and I are clearly talking about Sonny and Cher.\nAmy: Sheldon, this has to stop. I know it\u2019s hard. It\u2019s hard for me, too. But I\u2019ve seen and talked to you more in the two days we\u2019ve been broken up than in the last two months that we were together.\nSheldon: Well, if you want to see less of me, maybe we should go out again.\nScene: The Comic Book Store.\nRaj: I can\u2019t believe you made out with Mandy Chao.\nLeonard: Well, trust me, I wish it never happened.\nRaj: And you knew about this this whole time?\nHoward: I did.\nRaj: And you didn\u2019t think to tell me?\nHoward: Leonard asked me to keep it to myself.\nRaj: Let\u2019s leave Leonard out of this for the moment. This is about you and me.\nLeonard: Wait, wait, wait, how is my day-old marriage falling apart becoming about you two?\nRaj: Hang on. What do I need to do to make you trust me?\nHoward: You think it\u2019s hard having one wife, try having two.\nRaj: I bet you told Bernadette all about how he was screwing around with Mandy Chao.\nLeonard: Oh, we didn\u2019t screw around. We just got drunk and made out.\nRaj: Whatever. It would have been nice to hear it from you.\nScene: Amy\u2019s apartment. Sheldon knocks three times. \nAmy: What are you doing here?\nSheldon: I\u2019m here to return your belongings. That\u2019s what people who\u2019ve broken up do.\nAmy: And you didn\u2019t do your compulsive knocking ritual so I would open the door.\nSheldon: On the contrary, you no longer get to enjoy my charming eccentricities. We\u2019re not friends with benefits.\nAmy: Just give me the box.\nSheldon: Wait. Don\u2019t you want to go through it to make sure I haven\u2019t forgotten anything?\nAmy: Fine. My old scarf.\nSheldon: You wore it the night we went ice-skating. Remember?\nAmy: You mean the night that I went ice-skating, and you stood at the rail googling the symptoms of hypothermia?\nSheldon: We made one heck of a team, huh?\nAmy: Whose bra is this?\nSheldon: It\u2019s not yours? Oh, my. How embarrassing for both of us.\nAmy: It\u2019s Penny\u2019s.\nSheldon: Hey, you broke up with me. It is none of your business whose naked bosom I\u2019m smooshing around like pizza dough.\nAmy: Good-bye.\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. Hmm. Tables work, too. Good to know.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s kitchen.\nHoward: Ooh, brownies for girls\u2019 night!\nBernadette: Hands off. I\u2019m mad at you.\nHoward: Look, I know it\u2019s a lot of money, but the guy at the store said in five to seven years, it\u2019ll pay for itself.\nBernadette: What will pay for itself?\nHoward: Doesn\u2019t matter. What are you mad about?\nBernadette: I\u2019m mad at you for blabbing to me what Leonard did on the North Sea, and I\u2019m mad that I\u2019ve had to hide this from Penny for two years.\nHoward: And you have every right to be mad about those things. So, why don\u2019t you let me handle the credit card bill this month, huh? I mean, don\u2019t even look at it.\nBernadette: I mean, if Penny finds out I\u2019ve known all this time and haven\u2019t told her, she\u2019s gonna think I\u2019m a terrible friend. I wish you never told me.\nHoward: And I wish Leonard never told me. He\u2019s the bad guy here.\nBernadette: I guess that\u2019s true.\nHoward: And you let Penny marry him. Compared to that, who cares if I bought a George Clooney limited edition manscaping kit?\nScene: The apartment. \nLeonard (on phone): Hi. I\u2019m calling about your marriage counselling services and was curious what your rate is. Really? Um, okay. Is there any kind of discount for length of marriage? \u2018Cause we\u2019re just talking hours here.\nPenny (entering): Hi.\nLeonard: Call you back. Hey.\nPenny: Can we talk?\nLeonard: I would love that.\nPenny: All right, look, I\u2019m sorry I said I was okay with everything before we got married. I hate that we\u2019re going through this, but I don\u2019t know what to do.\nLeonard: If you don\u2019t mind waiting for a Groupon, we can try marriage counselling.\nSheldon (entering): Hello.\nLeonard: Hey, uh, buddy, can we have some privacy?\nSheldon: Oh, of course. Wouldn\u2019t want to intrude. This is yours.\nPenny: Okay, when I\u2019m done with him, I\u2019m gonna need more information.\nSheldon: Nothing odd. I just wanted to rub Amy\u2019s nose in it.\nPenny: Okay, look, I might be overreacting, but how am I supposed to get past this when I know tomorrow you\u2019re gonna go to work and see this woman?\nSheldon: Now, forgive me for eavesdropping, but as I see it, there\u2019s a simple solution.\nLeonard: Wake up, wake up, wake up.\nSheldon: Bring Penny to meet Mandy.\nLeonard: What? Why?\nSheldon: Well, right now, Penny\u2019s imagination is running wild, but if they meet, that will eliminate the mystery and alleviate her fears. Like when that Sparkletts guy let me look under his eye patch.\nLeonard: Uh, first of all, you made that guy cry.\nSheldon: And we learned that you don\u2019t need an eyeball to do that.\nLeonard: Secondly, I can\u2019t think of a more horrible idea than Penny meeting Mandy.\nPenny: Really? Why is that?\nLeonard: What, you actually want to meet her?\nPenny: No, but now that you\u2019re being weird about it, maybe I should.\nLeonard: I\u2019m not being weird. Am I being weird?\nSheldon: Yes. And that\u2019s coming from me.\nLeonard: Fine, you want to meet her?\nPenny: No, I just want to know that when you\u2019re at work, there\u2019s nothing going on.\nLeonard: How many times do I have to tell you? I have no interest in this woman.\nPenny: Yeah, well, maybe she has interest in you.\nSheldon: In Leonard? Oh, even the Sparkletts guy could see that\u2019s unlikely.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment.\nPenny: I guess my big problem is I never saw Leonard as the kind of guy who would do something like this.\nAmy: Anybody can make a mistake in a weak moment.\nPenny: What do you think?\nBernadette: I don\u2019t know what to think. But then again, I just found out about it.\nPenny: You know, I fell in love with Leonard because he wasn\u2019t anything like the guys I was used to dating. I mean, I knew those guys weren\u2019t above cheating because that\u2019s usually how we met.\nAmy: Come on, you know Leonard\u2019s not like that.\nPenny: I want to believe you. I really do. Am I being naive?\nBernadette: Oh, I don\u2019t know. This is all so new to me. I\u2019m still processing.\nPenny: You know, he never would\u2019ve done this when we first met. He\u2019s cockier now.\nAmy: That\u2019s because you made him more confident.\nBernadette: You know, if you think about it, without you, he never would\u2019ve grown into the person he is now. I mean, sure, more women might notice him, but I think it\u2019s better to have a guy be with you because he wants to be and not because he thinks he doesn\u2019t have any other choice.\nPenny: I never thought about it like that.\nBernadette: Oh, me neither, not until just now.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Hello. I\u2019m Dr. Sheldon Cooper, and welcome to Sheldon Cooper Presents: Fun With Flags. You may notice that I\u2019m holding a remote control. That\u2019s because my cameraperson and co-host, Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler, has chosen to end her relationship with me. I\u2019m going to pause here to let that sink in. Okay. If you need to pause a little longer, just click the pause button. But the show must go on. And thankfully, all the things my girlfriend used to do can be taken care of with my right hand. Anyway, let\u2019s not spend any more time talking about her. We\u2019re here to talk about flags. Tonight\u2019s theme, flags of countries that have been torn apart and the women I have a feeling were responsible.\nScene: The cafeteria.\nLeonard: You guys have any idea how much it costs to see a marriage counsellor?\nHoward: 250 dollars an hour. Why?\nRaj: How do you know?\nHoward: Bernadette and I have occasionally gone to one to, you know, stay on top of things.\nRaj: And I\u2019m just hearing about this now?\nHoward: Dude, just because we\u2019re best friends doesn\u2019t mean that I have to tell you everything that goes on.\nRaj: You don\u2019t have to, you should want to.\nLeonard: Oh, great, there\u2019s Mandy.\nHoward: Why are marine biologists always so cute?\nRaj: I don\u2019t know, but I\u2019d like to get lost in her Bermuda Triangle.\nLeonard: That\u2019s not helpful.\nHoward: Then I won\u2019t say I\u2019d like to cover three-quarters of her surface area.\nLeonard: Are we done?\nRaj: Not yet, this is fun. Ooh, I know. I\u2019d let her free my willy. Where you going?\nLeonard: I\u2019m gonna ask her if she\u2019d be willing to talk to Penny, tell her she has nothing to worry about.\nHoward: Leonard, wait.\nLeonard: What?\nHoward: I\u2019d like to SpongeBob her SquarePants.\nRaj: Now we are done.\nLeonard: Hey.\nMandy: Oh, hi, Leonard. What\u2019s up?\nLeonard: Uh, do you mind if I sit?\nMandy: Sure.\nLeonard: So, um, I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about you and me and the boat.\nMandy: What about it?\nLeonard: You know, what we did, when we were drunk.\nMandy: Oh, no, did I sleep with you, too?\nLeonard: No, we just made out.\nMandy: Oh. Well, good for me. So what can I do for you?\nLeonard: Uh, okay, well, um, I got married recently.\nMandy: Oh, congratulations. To Sheldon?\nLeonard: Never gets old. No, no, to a girl. Anyway, I told her what happened between you and me, and she\u2019s concerned about us seeing each other at work.\nMandy: It was just a kiss. Why would you even tell her?\nLeonard: Because I didn\u2019t want there to be any secrets between us.\nMandy: Is that really the reason?\nLeonard: What else would it be?\nMandy: I don\u2019t know. Sounds like you\u2019re trying to sabotage the relationship.\nLeonard: No, I don\u2019t think so. Although, Penny did say exactly that.\nMandy: Okay, well, that\u2019s something to think about.\nLeonard: You know, on some level, I\u2019ve always believed that I don\u2019t deserve a woman like her.\nMandy: Oh, you\u2019re gonna think about that right here?\nLeonard: I mean, she\u2019s really beautiful. She could have any guy she wants. Which is probably why it took her so many years to tell me she loved me.\nMandy: Maybe you should talk to a therapist about this.\nLeonard: Too expensive. You\u2019d think I\u2019d be used to women withholding their love. I mean, my mother did. I mean, no matter how hard I tried, she just didn\u2019t have any interest in me.\nMandy: Imagine that.\nLeonard: I wonder if that\u2019s why I have such a dysfunctional relationship with Sheldon. I had a dream the other night that I was in a cave and I was nursing a baby, but the baby had Sheldon\u2019s head on it.\nMandy: And your wife is worried about me?\nRaj: Hey, Leonard, when you\u2019re done, we came up with a bunch more.\nScene: Amy\u2019s apartment. Amy is watching Fun With Flags.\nSheldon (on screen): And then the Czech Republic says to Slovakia, I don\u2019t think you understand how being broken up works. Can you believe that? You\u2019d think that the Czech Republic would try to hold on to what it had, given that it\u2019s not as young as it used to be. And I don\u2019t see any other countries lining up to invade its southern borders.\nAmy: I\u2019m gonna kill him.\nSheldon: But enough about the Czech Republic. Let\u2019s talk about the time Moldova made Romania a birthday cake and Romania said it tasted good even though it didn\u2019t. And yet Romania gets dumped. I\u2019ll pause here while you mull that one over. I know, right?\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment.\nPenny: So, you said you had something to tell me.\nLeonard: Okay, yeah, um, do you remember when you accused me of trying to sabotage our wedding?\nPenny: Uh-huh.\nLeonard: I\u2019ve been thinking about it, and you might be right. But the good news is that I\u2019m pretty sure I know why.\nPenny: I\u2019m listening.\nLeonard: Penny, after all these years, I still feel like maybe I don\u2019t deserve you.\nPenny: Okay, that is the lamest excuse you could\u2019ve possibly come up with. But I get it.\nLeonard: You do?\nPenny: Yeah. Yeah, sometimes I worry you\u2019re gonna wake up and leave me for someone more like you.\nLeonard: I don\u2019t even understand why you\u2019re with someone like me. Why would I want to be with someone like me?\nPenny: You know what I mean. And, you know, maybe the way I\u2019ve been reacting was me sabotaging this, too.\nLeonard: Well, how about we stop being so scared of losing each other and just be together?\nPenny: That sounds nice.\nLeonard: Good. Because I\u2019ve loved you since the moment we met, and I will keep loving you until the end of time.\nPenny: Oh. Oh, my God, that is the most beautiful thing anyone\u2019s ever said to me.\nLeonard: Yeah? That\u2019s because you\u2019re beautiful, and your beauty fills my heart with love and song.\nPenny: It\u2019s getting kind of cheesy, Leonard.\nLeonard: Huh? If you think that\u2019s cheesy, buckle up. Penny Hofstadter, will you please stay married to me?\nPenny: Oh, damn it, you topped it. Should we go to the bedroom and make this marriage official?\nLeonard: Yes, please.\nPenny: Okay.\nScene: The apartment. \nPenny: Sheldon, I can\u2019t believe you got us a wedding gift.\nSheldon: I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re so surprised. I watch movies, I see what people do.\nLeonard: What is this?\nSheldon: Plane tickets and hotel reservations for a weekend away in San Francisco.\nPenny: Oh.\nLeonard: Wow.\nPenny: That\u2019s so great.\nSheldon: Yeah, there\u2019s Fisherman\u2019s Wharf and Alcatraz and cable cars. We\u2019re gonna have so much fun.\nPenny: We?\nSheldon: Is there a problem?\nPenny: Oh, no, no, I just, I said, Whee.\nAmy (at door): How dare you go on the Internet and say mean things about me and compare my genitalia to part of Czechoslovakia?\nSheldon: You saw through that one, did you?\nAmy: I don\u2019t know what you were thinking, but take the video down now.\nSheldon: She watched it. I\u2019m gonna get that girl back.\nAmy: I only watched it because you e-mailed it to me with the subject line this is gonna make you mad.\nSheldon: She was listening through the door. She wants me.\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "3_2": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The comic book store.\nHoward: Sheldon, you\u2019re wrong. Wolverine was not born with bone claws.\nSheldon: Howard, you know me to be a very smart man. Don\u2019t you think if I were wrong, I\u2019d know it?\nHoward: Okay, first of all\u2026\nRaj: Give it up, dude, you\u2019re arguing with a crazy person.\nSheldon: I\u2019m not crazy. My mother had me tested.\nLeonard: Hey, guys.\nHoward: What are you doing here?\nLeonard: What do you mean? It\u2019s new comic book night.\nRaj: Yeah, but since you and Penny finally hooked up, we thought you two would be having bouncy naked yum-yum night.\nLeonard: There\u2019s more to life than sex, Raj.\nHoward: Okay, who had Leonard flames out with Penny in less than 24 hours\u201d?\nSheldon: I did.\nLeonard: Nothing flamed out. We don\u2019t have to have sex every night, you know.\nHoward: You don\u2019t have to, but it\u2019s highly recommended.\nRaj: Yeah, take advantage of that window of opportunity before it slams shut on your little dinky.\nLeonard: It\u2019s not a matter of opportunity. We\u2019re getting to know each other. There\u2019s a learning curve.\nHoward: What\u2019s there to learn? You get naked, do nasty things to each other, then somebody makes scrambled eggs and salami. Easy peasy.\nSheldon: Perhaps what Leonard is obliquely referring to is the occurrence of some sort of sexual dysfunction.\nRaj: Okay, who had Leonard gets a floppy disk?\nSheldon: Oh, a clever, albeit obsolete, euphemism for insufficient blood flow to the male sex organ.\nLeonard: Nothing like that happened, all right? The sex was just fine.\nRaj: Just fine? Oh, dude, the fourth Harry Potter movie was just fine.\nLeonard: I\u2019m not saying it was bad, I\u2019m just saying it\u2026 wasn\u2019t great.\nHoward: Okay, when you say \u201cit wasn\u2019t great, do you mean for both of you? Because we can totally see it not being great for her. Am I right?\nRaj: Oh, yeah.\nLeonard: To tell you the truth, I think we were both a little, I don\u2019t know\u2026\nRaj: Disappointed? Let down?\nHoward: Ashamed? Horrified? Repulsed?\nLeonard: All I know is, it wasn\u2019t the way I dreamed it would be.\nHoward: Sex is never the way I dream it\u2019s gonna be.\nRaj: That\u2019s because in your dreams you\u2019re a horse from the waist down.\nSheldon: Excuse me, Wolverine: Origin. Miniseries issue two, page 22. Retractable bone claws. If you people spent less time thinking about sex and more time concentrating on comic books, we\u2019d have far fewer of these embarrassing moments.\nCredits Sequence\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: Sheldon, dinner\u2019s here.\nSheldon: Tandoori Palace?\nLeonard: No, we went somewhere new.\nSheldon: You\u2019re good-naturedly ribbing me, aren\u2019t you?\nLeonard: No, look, Mumbai Palace.\nSheldon: Why? Why would we change? We had a perfectly good palace. Tandoori Palace is our palace.\nLeonard: Trust me, this will be just fine.\nHoward: You are the authority on just fine.\nLeonard: What\u2019s that supposed to mean?\nHoward (after Raj whispers to him): Yeah, exactly. Not bad, but not great.\nPenny: What are they talking about?\nLeonard: I don\u2019t know\nSheldon: I know. As I\u2019m sure you\u2019re aware\u2026\nLeonard: Duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh.\nSheldon: If that\u2019s Morse code, that\u2019s terrible. As I was saying, you and Leonard had a disappointing sexual encounter. Earlier this evening, Leonard characterized it as just fine. So what you\u2019re seeing here is a continuation of the mocking that followed.\nPenny: Okay, yeah, well, I\u2019m just gonna go eat my dinner elsewhere. Maybe an airplane headed for a mountainside.\nLeonard: Penny, wait. Aagh! What is wrong with you?\nSheldon: I sense I may have crossed some sort of line.\nRaj: Yeah, you\u2026\nHoward: Uh, no, no, no, don\u2019t tell him, let\u2019s see if he can figure it out.\nPenny: Ugh, I am so embarrassed!\nLeonard: Please don\u2019t be mad.\nPenny: What did you tell them?\nLeonard: Nothing bad, just that last night was fine.\nPenny: Fine? You said it was fine?\nLeonard: Yeah, it\u2019s a perfectly good word. You put it in front of wine or dining, and you\u2019ve really got something. Okay, well, let me ask you this, how was last night for you?\nPenny: It was\u2026 okay.\nLeonard: Okay?\nPenny: Yeah, it\u2019s a perfectly good word. I mean, you put it in front of dokay and you really got something. All right, look, let\u2019s not overreact, you know? For a lot of couples, it takes time to get to know each other\u2019s rhythms. Learn what the other person wants and likes.\nLeonard: So, you\u2019ve been through this before?\nPenny: No.\nLeonard: Okay-dokay.\nPenny: You know, I think this is one of those things where talking about it is not going to make it better. Want a glass of wine?\nLeonard: So much.\nPenny: Okay. See, we should\u2019ve done this last night, you know, have a little wine, take the edge off.\nLeonard: Actually, ethyl alcohol inhibits electrical conduction in the nerve cells and stimulates reuptake receptors of inhibitory neurotransmitters like gamma-aminobutyric acid.\nPenny: Don\u2019t talk, just drink.\nHoward: No, you\u2019re misunderstanding. A shiksa goddess isn\u2019t an actual goddess and we don\u2019t pray to them, we prey on them.\nRaj: Whatever, dude. The point is, Leonard\u2019s got one and you don\u2019t.\nSheldon: Is this it? It was inappropriate to discuss Leonard and Penny\u2019s sex life in front of Leonard and Penny. (Howard indicates that he has got it.) Oh, good! Now I can eat.\nRaj: What\u2019s that?\nHoward: Sounds like a cricket.\nSheldon: Hang on. Based on the number of chirps per minute and the ambient temperature in this room, it is a snowy tree cricket.\nHoward: Oh, give me a frickin\u2019 break. How could you possibly know that?\nSheldon: In 1890, Emile Dolbear determined that there was a fixed relationship between the number of chirps per minute of the snowy tree cricket and the ambient temperature. A precise relationship that is not present with ordinary field crickets.\nRaj: How do you know what the exact temperature of the room is?\nSheldon: Under the terms of my roommate agreement with Leonard, I\u2019ve had unilateral control of the thermostat ever since the sweaty night of \u201906.\nHoward: Okay, you were right about Wolverine and bone claws, but you\u2019re wrong about the cricket.\nSheldon: Howard, don\u2019t embarrass yourself, the science chirps for itself. Humorous word play.\nHoward: No, no, not this time. I know insects, my friend, I spent many childhood years capturing them with nets, putting them in glass jars, sticking pins through them, mounting them on corrugated cardboard with Dymo labels underneath, identifying the genus and species. In Latin.\nRaj: Oh, dude, you are never getting a shiksa goddess.\nSheldon: That is a snowy tree cricket. Oecanthus fultoni. I was done with Latin by fifth grade.\nHoward: Okay, okay, tell you what. I am willing to bet anything that\u2019s an ordinary field cricket.\nSheldon: I can\u2019t take your money.\nHoward: What\u2019s the matter, you chicken?\nSheldon: I\u2019ve always found that an inappropriate slur. Chickens are not, by nature, at all timid. In fact, when I was young, my neighbour\u2019s chicken got loose and chased me up the big elm tree in front of our house.\nRaj: Chickens can\u2019t climb trees\nSheldon: Thank God.\nHoward: Okay, I believe a chicken made you his bitch. But the cricket thing, I don\u2019t buy. Bet me.\nSheldon: Fair enough. What stake do you propose?\nHoward: I will put up my Fantastic Four number 48, first appearance of Silver Surfer against your Flash 123, the classic Flash of two worlds issue.\nSheldon: All right, you have a wager.\nHoward: Hmm.\nRaj: Great. Now how are you going to settle it, hmm? There is no way to determine the species of the cricket without examining it.\nSlight time shift. The guys are searching for the cricket.\nRaj: I wonder what the non-pathetic people are doing tonight.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment, Penny and Leonard are kissing. They break and look at each other uncomfortably.\nLeonard: More wine?\nPenny: Hit me.\nScene: The apartment, the guys are still searching for the cricket. They are inside the cupboard.\nSheldon: I don\u2019t see anything.\nHoward: Shh!\nRaj: Hallway. (All try to exit at once and get stuck in doorway.)\nSheldon: One at a time. (Same thing happens again. Eventually they leave the apartment. There is a growling noise.) What was that?\nRaj: My stomach. Indian food doesn\u2019t agree with me. Ironic, isn\u2019t it?\nHoward: Shh! Elevator shaft.\nSheldon: Help me open it.\nHoward: Are you crazy? We can\u2019t go down an empty elevator shaft.\nSheldon: Fine, if you don\u2019t want to proceed, then you forfeit the bet, and I\u2019ll take possession of your Fantastic Four.\nHoward: Let\u2019s open her up.\nSheldon: Are you bothered that I can so easily manipulate you?\nHoward: Don\u2019t push me, Sheldon. I may be small, but I took kung fu when I was 13, and I remember a good deal of it.\nSheldon: Oh, really? Well, I grew up with an older brother and a very contentious twin sister and I believe I could easily best you in any physical confrontation, be it noogies, swirlies or the classic why are you hitting yourself?\nRaj: Ooh, big talk from a man who was once treed by a chicken.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment.\nLeonard: What are we drinking now?\nPenny: Peppermint schnapps.\nLeonard: Why would you buy peppermint schnapps?\nPenny: Because I like peppermint, and it\u2019s fun to say schnapps. Hey, Leonard?\nLeonard: What?\nPenny: Schnapps.\nLeonard: Schnapps. You\u2019re right, that is fun.\nScene: The elevator shaft. Sheldon is inside.\nRaj: Be careful.\nSheldon: If I were not being careful, your telling me to be careful would not make me careful.\nRaj (hearing the cricket): Stairwell.\nSheldon: Uh-oh, flashlight went out. I need some batteries. Fellas? Hello? It\u2019s really dark down here.\nScene: Penny\u2019s bathroom. Leonard is vomiting in the toilet. \nPenny: Oh, sweetie. You really can\u2019t hold your liquor, can you?\nLeonard: I\u2019m okay. Just a little mouthwash, and then I\u2019m gonna rock your world. (Penny vomits in sink) Are you okay? (Vomits in toilet again)\nScene: The university cafeteria. Raj has the cricket in a jar.\nRaj: Ugh, Toby, what did you do in a past life to be so disgusting now?\nSheldon: His name isn\u2019t Toby. Toby is an absurd name for a cricket.\nRaj: What would you name him?\nSheldon: An appropriate cricket name. For example, Jiminy.\nHoward: All right, Sheldon, here we go, Kleingast\u2019s Field Guide to North American Insects. Hey, Toby. Right here, see it? The common field cricket, aka Gryllus assimilis, which is Latin for suck it, you lose.\nSheldon: Hang on. Voil\u00e0, the snowy tree cricket, aka Oecanthus fultoni, which is Latin for I\u2019ll suck nothing. Of course I\u2019m joking because the Latin for that is nihil exsorbibo.\nHoward: That is not Toby, this is Toby. Raj, what do you think?\nRaj: Oh, I really don\u2019t care anymore\nLeonard: God, I had the most horrible night.\nRaj: What happened?\nSheldon: Obviously another carnal fiasco with the shiksi goddess.\nHoward: Shiksa. Shik-sa.\nSheldon: Forgive me. Yiddish was not spoken in east Texas. And if it was, it wasn\u2019t spoken for long.\nHoward: Yeah, fine, whatever. The point is, you\u2019re wrong again.\nSheldon: We haven\u2019t established that I\u2019m wrong once.\nHoward: All right. Tell you what, let\u2019s go down to the Entomology Department and let Professor\nCrawley tell us what kind of cricket Toby is.\nSheldon: He\u2019s a snowy tree cricket, and his name is Jiminy. (They leave) \nLeonard: I bet I could throw a rock in this room and come up with three better friends.\nScene: The Entomology Department.\n \nRaj: Holy crap. It\u2019s like Silence of the Lambs down here. (Howard tickles the back of his neck. He screams) Don\u2019t do that!\nHoward: You\u2019re such a girl. They\u2019re just bugs.\nRaj: Yeah, well, I don\u2019t like bugs, okay? They freak me out.\nSheldon: Interesting. You\u2019re afraid of insects and women. Ladybugs must render you catatonic. It was a joke. I made it to lessen your discomfort. You\u2019re welcome\nProf Crawley (arriving): Don\u2019t knock. Just walk in. Why be polite to the world\u2019s leading expert on the dung beetle?\nSheldon: Excuse me, are you Professor Crawley?\nProf Crawley: Who wants to know?\nSheldon: I\u2019m Dr. Cooper from the Physics Department.\nProf Crawley: Couldn\u2019t wait, huh?\nSheldon: I\u2019m sorry?\nProf Crawley: I haven\u2019t even packed yet, and you\u2019re already measuring my lab for one of your godless laser machines.\nHoward: No, you don\u2019t understand. We just want to ask you a question.\nProf Crawley: Let me ask you one first. What\u2019s a world renowned entomologist with a doctorate and 20 years of experience to do with his life when the university cuts off the funding for his lab, huh?\nRaj: Ask rhetorical questions that make people uncomfortable?\nProf Crawley: What\u2019s your deal? Are they planning to outsource my job to Bangalore?\nRaj: I\u2019m from New Delhi. Maybe you should find another entomologist.\nSheldon: No, no. We\u2019re here, let\u2019s settle this. Professor, can you identify our cricket?\nProf Crawley: Of course I can. I can identify every insect and arachnid on the planet. Not that that\u2019s going to keep me from having to move in with my daughter in Oxnard. And we\u2019re not talking Oxnard at the beach. No! We\u2019re talking Oxnard in the onion fields.\nHoward: Well, could you look at Toby?\nProf Crawley: Toby? What a stupid name for a cricket.\nSheldon: Told you.\nProf Crawley: It\u2019s a field cricket.\nHoward: Yes!\nSheldon: No, no, wait. Dr. Crawley, are you sure?\nProf Crawley: Young man, I\u2019ve been studying insects since I was eight years old. You know what they used to call me in school? Creepy Crawley.\nSheldon: Cruel as that may be, that is not in itself a credential.\nProf Crawley: Let me show you something. See that? That\u2019s a Crawley\u2019s dung beetle. I discovered it after spending six months slogging through a Bornean rain forest, while my wife was back home shacking up with a two-bit ornithologist who lives on a sailboat and likes to wear boot-cut jeans! So, when I tell you that that\u2019s a common field cricket, you can take that to the damn bank! Cause God knows I can\u2019t. That tramp took me for everything!\nSheldon: Well, apparently, I was wrong. Congratulations.\nRaj: Enjoy Oxnard. I\u2019m sure your daughter\u2019s looking forward to having you.\nScene: The lobby.\nPenny: Oh, hey, Sheldon. What you got there? A new comic book?\nSheldon: Old comic book. I just retrieved it from my safe deposit box.\nPenny: What do you have a safe deposit box for?\nSheldon: Old comic books. I lost this to Wolowitz in an ill-considered cricket wager.\nPenny: What, do they have Wii cricket now? That can\u2019t be very popular.\nSheldon: Penny, I\u2019d rather not talk about it.\nPenny: Well, if it makes you feel any better, I\u2019m not feeling so hot either.\nSheldon: Why would that make me feel better?\nPenny: I don\u2019t know, empathy? Anyway, I\u2019m just saying that you\u2019re feeling upset about something with Howard, and I\u2019m upset about something with Leonard.\nSheldon: Yes, yes, the disappointing sex. That\u2019s an inexact parallel. You and Leonard can always return to being friends, whereas I can never return to a state in which Wolowitz has not bested me like Mrs. Riley\u2019s chicken.\nPenny: What\u2019s Mrs. Riley\u2019s chicken?\nSheldon: A chicken that was owned by Mrs. Riley.\nPenny: Okay, forget the chicken.\nSheldon: Well, I wish I could.\nPenny: No, no. You may be right about me and Leonard.\nSheldon: Of course I\u2019m right What are the odds I\u2019d be wrong twice in one week?\nPenny: No, I mean, we can always go back to being friends.\nSheldon: I just said that. This conversation has started to circle. Meeting adjourned.\nScene: The apartment\nSheldon: Hello.\nLeonard: Hey. What\u2019s going on?\nSheldon: Oh, you\u2019d like to catch up on the events of the day. All right. Well, there was a half-hour wait at the bank to get into my safe deposit box, I was forced to talk to Penny about your sexual problems, and, oh, yes, in a moment filled with biblical resonance, pride wenteth before my fall, causing my Flash 123 to goeth to Wolowitz.\nLeonard: Wait a minute. You talked to Penny about our sex life?\nSheldon: Leonard, it astonishes me how you continually fixate on the trivial. I lost a bet to Wolowitz.\nLeonard: Right, right. You\u2019re saying you talked to Penny?\nSheldon:\u00a0 Yes.\nLeonard: Interesting.\nSheldon: Hardly.\nLeonard: Excuse me.\nSheldon: Have I crossed some sort of line again?\nLeonard: Little bit. (Exits)\nSheldon: Hmm. Oh, who cares?\nScene: Penny\u2019s doorway.\nPenny: Oh, hey.\nLeonard: Hey. Uh, what did Sheldon say to you?\nPenny: Not a lot. Just that we always have the option of going back to being friends.\nLeonard: Is that what you want?\nPenny: I don\u2019t know. I mean, you have to admit things seemed simpler when we were just friends.\nLeonard: I guess.\nPenny: It would take the pressure off.\nLeonard: It would, wouldn\u2019t it?\nPenny: So, we\u2019ll just be friends.\nLeonard: Good, good.\nPenny: Come here. (She gives him a hug. It turns into a big kiss.)\n \nLeonard (closing door): Okay-dokay\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "3_11": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The apartment.\nPenny: Oh, I always tear up when the Grinch\u2019s heart grows three sizes.\nSheldon: Tears seem appropriate. Enlargement of the heart muscle, or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, is a serious disease which could lead to congestive heart failure.\nLeonard (singing Deck the Halls): Fa-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la.\nPenny: You really didn\u2019t like it, Sheldon?\nSheldon: No, on the contrary. I found the Grinch to be a relatable, engaging character, and I was really with him right up to the point that he succumbed to social convention and returned the presents and saved Christmas. What a buzz kill that was.\nLeonard: When we watch Frosty the Snowman, he roots for the sun.\nSheldon: Excuse me, but the sun is essential for all life on Earth. Frosty is merely a bit of frozen supernatural ephemera in a stolen hat. A crime, by the way, for which he is never brought to account.\nLeonard (continuing Deck the Halls): Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la.\nCredits sequence. \n \nScene: The apartment.\nPenny: I just love decorating the Christmas tree. It makes me feel like a little girl again.\nLeonard: We didn\u2019t have a tree when I was growing up.\nPenny: Really? Why not?\nLeonard: Mmm, in my family, holidays weren\u2019t so much celebrated as studied for their anthropological and psychological implications on human society.\nPenny: Oh, sounds festive. Did you at least give presents?\nLeonard: Mmm, in a way. We presented papers, and then broke off into focus groups and critiqued each other.\nPenny: Sheldon, what about you? Did you have a Christmas tree?\nSheldon: Oh, yes. We had a tree, we had a manger, we had an inflatable Santa Claus with plastic reindeer on the front lawn. And to make things even more jolly, there were so many blinking lights on the house they induced neighbourhood-wide seizures.\nPenny: So I take it you don\u2019t want to help us trim the tree.\nSheldon: I do not. But if you insist on decorating a spider-infested fire hazard in my home I would request that you add this.\nPenny: What is it?\nSheldon: You\u2019re kidding, right? It\u2019s a bust of Sir Isaac Newton.\nPenny: Oh, sure, sure, yeah. Very Christmassy.\nSheldon: Wait, excuse me, but it\u2019s much more Christmassy than anything you\u2019ve put on the tree.\nLeonard: Here we go.\nSheldon: December 25, 1642, Julian calendar, Sir Isaac Newton is born. Jesus, on the other hand, was actually born in the summer. His birthday was moved to coincide with a traditional pagan holiday that celebrated the winter solstice with lit fires and slaughtered goats. Which, frankly, sounds like more fun than 12 hours of church with my mother followed by a fruitcake.\nLeonard: Merry Newton-mas, everyone.\nSheldon: I sense that\u2019s not sincere, although I have no idea why.\nPenny: No, it\u2019s fine. Look, Sir Isaac can go right next to this little candy cane.\nSheldon: No. Isaac goes at the top of the tree.\nLeonard: No, he doesn\u2019t.\nSheldon: I understand. You dispute Newton\u2019s claim that he invented calculus and you want to put Gottfried Leibniz on the top.\nLeonard: Yeah, you got me. I\u2019m a Leibniz man.\nSheldon: Well, perhaps when your mother gets here, she\u2019ll talk some sense into you.\nPenny: What? Your\u2026 your mother\u2019s coming? When?\nLeonard: Tomorrow.\nPenny: When were you going to tell me?\nLeonard: Um, tomorrow?\nPenny: Why were you keeping this a secret?\nLeonard: Well, I just, I thought\u2026\nSheldon: If I can interject here, obviously Leonard is concerned that his mother won\u2019t approve of you as his mate.\nPenny: Why wouldn\u2019t she approve of me? I\u2019m adorable.\nLeonard: You are, it\u2019s just\u2026\nSheldon: If I can interject again. Leonard comes from a remarkably high-achieving family, who have all chosen high-achieving partners. He probably feels that it\u2019s doubtful that his mother will be overly impressed with his dating a woman whose most significant achievement is memorizing the Cheesecake Factory menu.\nPenny: Hey, it\u2019s a big menu. There\u2019s two pages just for desserts.\nLeonard: I know. And those specials, they change every day.\nPenny: Okay, you know what? It\u2019s lame when I say it, it\u2019s just ridiculous when you pile on.\nLeonard: Okay, sorry.\nPenny: So what did she say when you told her we were going out?\nLeonard: Um\u2026\nPenny: You didn\u2019t tell her we were going out, did you?\nLeonard: Um\u2026\nPenny: Why not?\nLeonard: Um\u2026\nSheldon: Leonard, I\u2019m no expert on meditation, but if you\u2019re trying to calm yourself down, I believe the word is Om.\nScene: Leonard\u2019s car.\nBeverley: It was so nice of you to come all the way down to the airport to pick me up.\nSheldon: No trouble at all.\nLeonard: I drove, Mother. I\u2019m driving now.\nBeverley: Yes, dear. Mommy\u2019s proud. I\u2019ve been meaning to thank you for your notes on my paper disproving quantum brain dynamic theory.\nSheldon: My pleasure. For a non-physicist, you have a remarkable grasp of how electric dipoles in the brain\u2019s water molecules could not possibly form a Bose condensate.\nLeonard: Wait, wait, wait. When did you send my mom notes on a paper?\nSheldon: August 16th. Right after her carpal tunnel surgery.\nBeverley: Oh, did I thank you for the flowers?\nSheldon: You did.\nBeverley: I don\u2019t really like flowers.\nSheldon: Neither do I, but it\u2019s the social convention.\nBeverley: It is, isn\u2019t it?\nLeonard: Wait, wait, wait. You had surgery?\nBeverley: Yes, and Sheldon sent me flowers.\nLeonard: No, I heard that.\nBeverley: Then what was all that wait, wait, wait about?\nLeonard: I just don\u2019t understand why he knows more about your life than I do.\nBeverley: Well, I would assume it\u2019s because Sheldon and I stay in touch due to mutual interest and respect, while you avoid me, due to unresolved childhood issues.\nSheldon: It\u2019s what we think caused your narcissistic personality disorder. We discussed it at length during our last video chat. Although how we got onto the subject of you is baffling.\nBeverley: Yes, but we are on the subject, so I\u2019m obliged to ask, Leonard, how are you?\nLeonard: Fine, Mom. How are you?\nBeverley: Mmm, menopausal.\nLeonard: Now I\u2019m less fine.\nBeverley: Have you heard your brother has gotten engaged?\nLeonard: No. Sheldon, why didn\u2019t you tell me?\nSheldon: My bad. I did send a gift from both of us.\nBeverley: She\u2019s a remarkable girl. The youngest appeals court judge in New Jersey and a two-time Olympic bronze medallist.\nLeonard: You must be very happy.\nBeverley: Why? I\u2019m not marrying her. So, how about you? Are you seeing anyone interesting?\nSheldon: Well, I\u2019m not sure about interesting, but\u2026\nLeonard: Not the time, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Very well. Shall we switch topics to Isaac Newton v. Gottfried Leibniz?\nBeverley: It\u2019s all right, Sheldon. I will just pretend that Leonard\u2019s not withholding information. Although, I will point out, Leonard, that I am a trained psychiatrist and you are exhibiting the same secretive behavioural tics that accompanied your learning to masturbate.\nSheldon: Isn\u2019t she brilliant, Leonard? How I envy you.\nScene: The apartment.\n \nBeverley: So, Howard, have you and Rajesh finally summoned the courage to express your latent homosexual feelings toward one another?\nHoward: What? No.\nBeverley: Why not?\nHoward: Because we don\u2019t have latent homosexual feelings toward one another.\nBeverley: I see.\nHoward: No, really. I have a girlfriend now.\nBeverley: And where is she this evening?\nHoward: She had to go out of town. Her grandmother died.\nBeverley: I see. Her grandmother died.\nHoward: Honest to God. Leonard, tell her I have a girlfriend.\nLeonard: I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\nHoward: What do you mean you don\u2019t know what I\u2019m talking about? Tell her I have a girlfriend!\nLeonard: All right. He \u201chas\u201d a \u201cgirlfriend.\u201d\nHoward: Her name is Bernadette, she\u2019s working as a waitress, but she\u2019s going to school to be a microbiologist.\nBeverley: Howard, keep in mind that the more passionately you stick to this construct, the more you\u2019re hurting your partner.\nHoward (to Raj who has whispered to him): Do you really think your lips in my ear is helping?\nPenny (arriving): Hi. Sorry I\u2019m late.\nLeonard: Oh, glad you\u2019re here, uh, sit down, I\u2019ll get you a plate. Mom, you remember Penny.\nBeverley: Oh, yes, the waitress slash actress with the unresolved father issues. Has he finally come to terms with his little slugger growing breasts?\nPenny: Well, he sent me a football and a catcher\u2019s mitt for Christmas, so I\u2019m going to say no.\nHoward: If it helps, we\u2019re all good with your breasts.\nBeverley: Classic overcompensation. Oh, speaking of fathers, Leonard, that reminds me, I\u2019m divorcing yours.\nLeonard: What?\nBeverley: Yes. He was cheating on me.\nLeonard: No!\nBeverley: Yes, with some waitress from the university cafeteria. Can you believe it? A waitress? Oh, no offense, dear.\nPenny: No, it sounded like a compliment.\nLeonard: When did this happen?\nBeverley: Mmm, well, let\u2019s see. Sheldon, when did I leave Leonard\u2019s father?\nSheldon: September 22nd.\nBeverley: Oh, yes, that\u2019s right. The weekend after Leonard\u2019s dog died.\nLeonard: Mitzy\u2019s dead?\nSheldon: She was old and blind, Leonard. What choice did we have?\nLeonard: I don\u2019t believe this. Why am I the last to know?\nBeverley: Excuse me, Leonard, I am the one who\u2019s getting a divorce, Mitzy is the one who is dead. Why are you the one making a fuss?\nLeonard: You\u2019re right. I\u2019m-I\u2019m-I\u2019m-I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m way out of line!\nBeverley: So, Penny, what\u2019s new in your life?\nPenny: Nothing. Not a damn thing.\nScene: Penny\u2019s car.\nBeverley: Thank you for driving me back to my hotel.\nPenny: Oh, it\u2019s not a problem.\nBeverley: I was going to ask Leonard to do it, but he seemed a bit emotionally unstable and you don\u2019t want someone like that operating heavy machinery.\nPenny: No, you do not.\nBeverley: Your check engine light is on.\nPenny: Yeah, I gotta put a sticker over that. So, uh, you must be devastated about your divorce.\nBeverley: Oh, not at all. But I am a bit distressed to be in a vehicle that\u2019s not subjected to regular maintenance.\nPenny: Come on, I mean, you\u2019re not upset that your marriage is over?\nBeverley: Well, initially I felt something akin to grief and perhaps anger, but that\u2019s the natural reaction of the limbic system to being betrayed by a loathsome son of a bitch.\nPenny: Sure, sure.\nBeverley: Thankfully, my shock was somewhat mitigated by the fact that I haven\u2019t had intercourse with him in eight years.\nPenny: Eight years?\nBeverley: Oh, that\u2019s nothing. I\u2019ve been responsible for my own orgasms since 1982.\nPenny: Yikes. What\u2019s so funny?\nBeverley: That\u2019s exactly what I say during orgasms. Yikes.\nPenny: You know what? I could use a drink. Do you want to stop for a drink?\nBeverley: Oh, I don\u2019t drink.\nPenny: I do, I\u2019ll teach you.\nScene: Leonard\u2019s bedroom.\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard? (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard? (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard?\nLeonard: What is it?\nSheldon: I made tea.\nLeonard: I don\u2019t want tea.\nSheldon: I didn\u2019t make tea for you. This is my tea.\nLeonard: Then why are you telling me?\nSheldon: It\u2019s a conversation starter.\nLeonard: That\u2019s a lousy conversation starter.\nSheldon: Oh, is it? We\u2019re conversing. Checkmate.\nLeonard: What do you want, Sheldon?\nSheldon: What I want is to be departing the Starship Enterprise in a one-man shuttle craft headed to the planetoid I rule known as Sheldon Alpha Five.\nLeonard: I want that too. Why are you here?\nSheldon: To comfort you, of course. No, that\u2019s not going to work at all, I\u2019ll comfort you from over here. Leonard, what you\u2019re experiencing is a classic Jungian crisis in which the aging individual mourns the loss of the never-to-be realized ideal family unit.\nLeonard: Thank you, that\u2019s very comforting.\nSheldon: That\u2019s not the comforting part.\nLeonard: It\u2019s not?\nSheldon: No, no. The comforting part is that the Germans have a term for what you\u2019re feeling. Weltschmerz. It means the depression that arises from comparing the world as it is to a hypothetical, idealized world.\nLeonard: You\u2019re right, I do feel better.\nSheldon: Well, the Germans have always been a comforting people. Just remember, Leonard, where your biological family has failed you, you always have me, your surrogate family.\nLeonard: You\u2019re my surrogate family?\nSheldon: If it\u2019s any consolation, I\u2019m not happy about it either. Good night.\nScene: A bar.\n \nPenny: Okay, now this time try drinking it all at once.\nBeverley: Yikes.\nPenny: I\u2019ve been responsible for my own buzz since 2003. Another round for me and my homegirl.\nBeverley: I feel a spreading warmth through my extremities.\nPenny: As long as you don\u2019t feel it running down your pants, you\u2019re fine.\nBeverley: Oh, that is fascinating. I\u2019m noticing an immediate lowering of my inhibitions. For example, I\u2019m seriously considering asking that busboy to ravish me in the alleyway while I eat cheesecake. What do you think?\nPenny: Well, we are known for our cheesecake. Hit us again.\nBeverley: Yes. If a little is good, more must be better.\nPenny: Hey, Bev, guess what?\nBeverley: What?\nPenny: I\u2019m sleeping with your son.\nBeverley: Really? Which one?\nPenny: The one from whom I live across the hall from.\nBeverley: Well, that\u2019s convenient. How did his penis turn out?\nPenny: Oh, Beverly, I can\u2019t talk to my boyfriend\u2019s mother about his penis.\nBeverley: Oh, fair enough. What can you tell me, if anything, about that busboy\u2019s penis?\nPenny: Actually, I\u2019ve only had the cheesecake. One more time. You know, Leonard did not want to tell you we were dating.\nBeverley: Really? Well, that means he\u2019s either embarrassed about the relationship or he doesn\u2019t care enough about his mother to tell her he\u2019s in one. Either way, one of us should be insulted.\nPenny: Well, let\u2019s go find out who.\nBeverley: You go get a taxi. I\u2019m gonna slip my business card into that busboy\u2019s back pocket, cupping his firm, right buttock as I do so.\nScene: The apartment.\nPenny: Leonard?\nBeverley: Sonny boy!\nPenny: Get out here! Your mommy wants to talk to you!\nLeonard: What the hell is going on?\nPenny: You\u2019re in trouble.\nBeverley: Why didn\u2019t you tell me you were tapping my homegirl? Did I say that right?\nPenny: Yeah, not bad, not bad.\nLeonard: Are you guys drunk?\nBeverley: Well, I hope so. Otherwise, why would we have stopped at Del Taco? Now, how could you not tell me you were in a relationship with this lovely, charming young woman?\nPenny: Oh, thank you.\nBeverley: You\u2019re welcome. Is it because she\u2019s uneducated, trapped in a menial service position?\nPenny: What the hell happened to lovely and charming?\nLeonard: How come you didn\u2019t tell me that you and Father were getting a divorce? How come you didn\u2019t tell me you had surgery? How come you didn\u2019t tell me my dog died?\nBeverley: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. What I hear you saying is that you want a more intimate mother-son relationship.\nLeonard: I do.\nBeverley (gives him an uncomfortable hug): There. It\u2019s late. Now, go to bed. I\u2019m getting a warm feeling spreading through my heart.\nPenny: That\u2019s the Del Taco.\nSheldon: Why is Leonard softly banging his head against his bedroom door?\nBeverley: Speaking of warm feelings, come here. (She grabs Sheldon and kisses him) No, I\u2019d rather have the busboy.\nScene: Leonard\u2019s car.\nBeverley: Thank you for taking me to the airport.\nSheldon: You\u2019re very welcome.\nLeonard: Once again, I\u2019m driving. I\u2019m right here.\nBeverley: Please, I am very hungover and in no mood to satisfy your need for approval. Sheldon, I do hope you\u2019ll forgive me for my inappropriate behaviour last night.\nSheldon: I don\u2019t blame you. You were intoxicated.\nBeverley: Thank you.\nSheldon: I blame Penny.\nPenny: I blame Penny, too. Bad Penny.\nLeonard: Wait a minute, what are you talking about? What inappropriate behaviour?\nBeverley: I think it\u2019s best that you not know.\nSheldon: Agreed.\nPenny: Agreed.\nLeonard: What the hell, agreed.\nBeverley: And I want you to take very good care of this young woman.\nPenny: Oh, thank you, Beverly.\nBeverley: You\u2019re welcome. She doesn\u2019t have much in the way of career prospects, don\u2019t make her responsible for her own orgasms as well.\nLeonard: Mother, remember when I was complaining that you don\u2019t communicate with me enough?\nBeverley: Yes, dear.\nLeonard: I\u2019m over it.\nPenny (finishing Deck the Halls): Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la la-la.\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "2_19": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The apartment.\nPenny: Okay, it\u2019s done. Look, guys, for the future, I don\u2019t mind killing the big spiders, but you have to at least try with the little ones.\nSheldon: Penny, please, we\u2019re facing a far more serious problem than stray arachnids.\nLeonard: Sheldon, it\u2019s not that bad.\nSheldon: Not bad? It\u2019s horrible. I mean, you hear stories about this sort of thing, but you never think it\u2019ll happen to you.\nLeonard: So they steamed your dumplings, get over it. New topic, please.\nHoward: All right, Penny, let me take this opportunity to point out that you are looking particularly ravishing today.\nPenny: Not with a thousand condoms, Howard.\nHoward: So, there is a number.\nPenny: Okay, new topic, please. Hey, did you hear the people upstairs in 5A are moving out?\nLeonard: Shh-shh-shh!\nSheldon: What?\nPenny: The people upstairs are moving out.\nLeonard: No!\nSheldon: The horror!\nLeonard: Why would you just say something like that?\nSheldon: No, no, no, no, no, no, no\u2026\nPenny: How else was I supposed to say it?\nLeonard: Slowly, like putting a new fish in a tank. You don\u2019t just drop it in, you let the bag sit in the water a while.\nSheldon: The horror!\nPenny: Sheldon, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s going to be fine.\nSheldon: No, it\u2019s not going to be fine, change is never fine. They say it is, but it\u2019s not.\nPenny: Okay, honey, did you even know the people that are moving out?\nSheldon: I never met them. That\u2019s what made them perfect, there were no awkward hellos in the halls, there was no clickety-clacking of high heel shoes on hardwood floors, they may as well have been a family of cats just jumping around from drape to drape without that annoying ammonia urine smell.\nPenny: Well, I\u2019m sure the new people will be just as quiet.\nSheldon: You can\u2019t know that. How can you possibly know that?\nPenny: You\u2019re right, I can\u2019t. You know what? Anyone could rent that apartment now, an opera singer, the cast of stomp, yeah, a tap-dancing pirate with a wooden leg.\nLeonard: Why are you making it worse?\nPenny: I tried making it better, he wouldn\u2019t go for it.\nHoward (after Raj whispers to him): You\u2019re right, that\u2019s a great idea.\nLeonard: What?\nHoward: I\u2019ll take the apartment upstairs. I can finally get away from my mother, and we can all spend some more time together, if you catch my drift.\nPenny: The horror!\nCredits sequence.\nScene: Outside Howard\u2019s house.\nSheldon: Hold on. You honestly expect me to believe that social protocol dictates we break our backs helping Wolowitz move, and then he only need buy us a pizza?\nLeonard: I\u2019m sorry, that really is how it works.\nSheldon: You\u2019re tricking me. You tell me the truth, what do we get?\nLeonard: Raj, help me out here.\nRaj: You get to choose between a mountain bike or a PS3.\nSheldon: I knew it! PS3, definitely\u00a0 PS3, who would pick a mountain bike?\nHoward (voice from inside): Enough with the guilt, ma, we\u2019ll still see each other. I\u2019ll come over every night and have dinner with you.\nHoward\u2019s Mother (voice): The hell you will! What am I running here, a fancy restaurant? Does this look like Olive Garden?\nHoward (voice): Okay, I get it, you\u2019re angry. You don\u2019t want to see your little bird leave the nest.\nHoward\u2019s Mother (voice): Little bird? You\u2019re almost 30, fly, for god\u2019s sake!\nHoward (voice): Fine, I\u2019ll stay! You happy, crazy lady? I sure as hell hope so, because you\u2019re ruining my life!\nLeonard (into phone): Hey, Penny, it\u2019s Leonard. Good news, you can take your head out of the oven.\nSheldon (removing hernia support): I guess I won\u2019t be needing this.\nScene: The lobby, there are boxes everywhere and removal men are carrying them up the stairs.\nSheldon: Oh, no, the new ones, they\u2019re here.\nLeonard: Stay calm, we don\u2019t know anything about them yet. What are you doing?\nSheldon: I\u2019m checking for musical instruments. Does that sound like castanets to you?\nLeonard: The box says kitchen.\nSheldon: So? Do cocaine smugglers write cocaine on the box?\nBlonde girl (arriving): Hello?\nLeonard: Hello.\nSheldon: Hello.\nBlonde Girl: Hello.\nLeonard: Hello.\nSheldon: Hello.\nBlonde Girl: I\u2019m Alicia. I\u2019m moving in upstairs.\nLeonard: That is so great. Oh, I\u2019m Leonard, I live downstairs. Upstairs from here, but under you. Not under you per se, but under your apartment.\nAlicia: That\u2019s nice.\nLeonard: Yeah, it is.\nSheldon: If that concludes your faltering attempt to mate, hello.\nAlicia: Hello.\nSheldon: Hello. On a scale of one to ten how light of foot would you describe yourself with one being not cat-like at all and ten being freakishly feline?\nAlicia: Freakishly feline?\nSheldon: Is that your answer or do you not understand the question? We\u2019ll come back to that one.\nLeonard: Sheldon\u2026\nSheldon: Hang on. Are you now or have you ever been a salsa, Irish folk or break-dancer?\nAlicia: No.\nLeonard: You\u2019re making her uncomfortable.\nSheldon: Oh, I\u2019m sorry. Well, if it helps you feel any better you\u2019re doing very well so far. Next question, are you fertile?\nAlicia: What?!\nSheldon: I\u2019m trying to determine whether crying infants above my head are a possibility.\nAlicia: I have no immediate plans.\nSheldon: If that changes, let me know. And finally, area rugs, pro or con?\nAlicia: Pro?\nSheldon: Alicia?\nAlicia: Yes?\nSheldon: Welcome to the building.\nScene: The stairs\nAlicia:Thanks so much for helping me, Leonard.\nLeonard: Thank you so much for giving me the opportunity to help.\nPenny (exiting apartment): Oh, hey, guys.\nLeonard: Hey, Penny. this is Alicia, our new neighbour.\nPenny: Hi.\nAlicia: Hi.\nLeonard: I\u2019m helping.\nPenny: I can see.\nSheldon: Alicia\u2019s non-musical, childless and pro-rug. She\u2019s still on probation, of course, but I like her.\nAlicia: Cool t-shirt.\nPenny: Oh, yeah, I don\u2019t usually dress like this. I\u2019m going jogging.\nSheldon: You don\u2019t jog.\nPenny: I can start.\nSheldon: True, but the more likely explanation for your attire is that you\u2019re out of clean clothes again.\nPenny: Thank you, Sheldon.\nSheldon: You\u2019re welcome, Penny.\nAlicia: Please, you look cute. I\u2019m dressed like a slob today, too.\nLeonard: I think you look fantastic.\nAlicia: This one\u2019s a player, huh?\nPenny: Oh, yeah, be careful.\nAlicia: Thanks for the warning.\nPenny: Okay.\nAlicia: I\u2019ll see you around.\nPenny: See ya. I\u2019m dressed like a slob today, too.\nSheldon: Oh, mimicry. I enjoy mimicry. I\u2019ve been working on Admiral Ackbar from Return of the Jedi. \u201cIt\u2019s a trap.\u201d You have to imagine me with a giant squid head. \u201cIt\u2019s a trap. It\u2019s a trap. It\u2019s a trap.\u201d\nScene: The apartment. Sheldon is writing on an imaginary board. There is a knock on the door.\nSheldon: Come.\nPenny (entering): Hey.\nSheldon: Congratulations, I see you did your laundry.\nPenny: Well, sort of.\nSheldon: How does one sort of\u2026\nPenny: I bought new clothes, okay? Is Leonard around?\nSheldon: He\u2019s upstairs at Alicia\u2019s.\nPenny: Oh. all right, that\u2019s cool, no biggie. He said he\u2019d help me set up my printer, but I guess I can wait. What exactly is he doing up there?\nSheldon: In what I can only perceive as a tactical move to destroy me, he is with Wolowitz and Koothrappali setting up her stereo.\nPenny: Oh, they\u2019re all up there, huh? Hmm, typical.\nSheldon: It\u2019s axiomatically atypical. Up until recently, they did not know Alicia, and had no encounters with her in a previous location. They never went upstairs to visit the former tenants, so your characterization of their behaviour as typical Is demonstrably fallacious.\nPenny: Okay, now I see the giant squid head. (Leaves)\nSheldon: Oh, great! now, I have to start all over again. (Rubs out imaginary workings)\nScene: Alicia\u2019s apartment.\nHoward: Yeah, I thought about renting this apartment, but I\u2019m really more of a downtown loft kind of guy.\nAlicia: Cool. so are you in a loft now?\nHoward: Oh, actually I\u2019m, uh, living with a woman in Altadena. Purely platonic, she\u2019s also my maid.\nAlicia: Sounds like a sweet deal.\nHoward: I won\u2019t lie, it\u2019s pretty dope.\nPenny (arriving): Hello?\nAlicia: Oh, hey.\nPenny: Hey, I just wanted to bring you a little housewarming gift.\nAlicia: That is so sweet. Come on in, let\u2019s open it.\nPenny: Great.\nAlicia: Nice dress.\nPenny: Oh, this? I\u2019m dressed like a slob today.\nAlicia: The guys have been helping me set up my sound system. I\u2019ve never had such good-looking technical support.\nHoward: Oh, pish-posh. (Raj whispers to him) I don\u2019t know, it means shucks. (Raj whispers again) Shucks means shucks. Let one go once in a while.\nLeonard: Hey, uh, penny, you want to hear something awesome?\nPenny: Yeah.\nLeonard: Alicia is an actress, just like you.\nPenny: That is so awesome.\nAlicia: Well, trying to be, but it\u2019s so hard.\nPenny: Yeah, I know, tell me about it.\nAlicia: I\u2019ve been out here three months, and all I\u2019ve gotten is a couple of national commercials and this recurring thing on a soap.\nPenny: That\u2019s why I work at the Cheesecake Factory, I\u2019m holding out for the right part.\nLeonard: Alicia, what do you want as your default setting for DVDs, 5.1 Dolby or DTS?\nAlicia: Whatever you think is best, cutie.\nLeonard: Well, DTS has more low end, so\u2026 okay.\nPenny: Uh, hey, guys, guys, you will really appreciate this, I read the best science joke on the internet. Alicia, you won\u2019t get it, but it\u2019s right up their alley. Anyway, so, this physicist goes into an ice cream parlour every week and orders an ice cream sundae for himself, and then offers one to the empty stool sitting next to him. This goes on for a while until the owner finally asks him what he\u2019s doing. The man says, \u201cwell, I\u2019m a physicist, and quantum mechanics teaches us that it is possible for the matter above this stool to spontaneously turn into a beautiful woman who might accept my offer and fall in love with me.\u201d The owner then says, \u201cwell, lots of single, beautiful women come in here every day, why don\u2019t you buy an ice cream for one of them, and they might fall in love with you?\u201d And the physicist says, \u201cyeah, but what are the odds of that happening?\u201d\nLeonard: It\u2019s a little insulting, don\u2019t you think?\nPenny: How would I know? I\u2019m not even sure I get it.\nAlicia: Hey, Leonard? If you\u2019re done with the DVD player, can you set up my printer?\nLeonard: Uh, yeah, I\u2019d love to.\nPenny: Uh, hey, maybe when you\u2019re done with her printer, you could set up mine. You know, like you promised a week ago.\nLeonard: Yeah, I\u2019ll get to it, don\u2019t nag me.\nRaj (drinking some wine): Hello there\nScene: The apartment. Penny walks in without knocking and collapses on the sofa.\n \nSheldon: Who is it? Oh hello, Penny, it\u2019s open, come in. Sarcasm.\nPenny: Well, they\u2019re all still up there.\nSheldon: You think I can\u2019t hear them? Listen to that. Stomp, stomp, stomp. That\u2019s Wolowitz in his stacked heels that fool no one.\nPenny: I don\u2019t even know why I care. I don\u2019t care. All right, I cared enough to memorize that stupid joke, but that\u2019s all I care.\nSheldon: You know, Penny, there\u2019s something that occurs in beehives you might find interesting. Occasionally, a new queen will arrive while the old queen is still in power. When this happens, the old queen must either locate to a new hive or engage in a battle to the death until only one queen remains.\nPenny: What are you saying, that I\u2019m threatened by Alicia? That I\u2019m like the old queen of the hive and it\u2019s just time for me to go?\nSheldon: I\u2019m just talking about bees. They\u2019re on the discovery channel. What are you talking about?\nPenny: Bees. Aaah! I just got that physicist joke.\nScene: The apartment.\n \nLeonard: Gee, Penny, thanks for buying us dinner.\nHoward: Yeah, what\u2019s the occasion?\nPenny: No, no occasion, just felt like getting some Chinese chow for my peeps.\nSheldon: Did you remember to ask for the chicken with broccoli to be diced, not shredded?\nPenny: Yes.\nSheldon: Even though the menu description specifies shredded?\nPenny: Yes.\nSheldon: Brown rice, not white?\nPenny: Yes.\nSheldon: You stop at the Korean grocery and get the good hot mustard?\nPenny: Yes.\nSheldon: Did you pick up the low-sodium soy sauce from the market?\nPenny: Yes\nSheldon: Good. See how it\u2019s done, Leonard?\nPenny: So, what do we got going on tonight, huh? Playing Halo watching Battlestar, drop some mentos in diet coke?\nLeonard: You want to watch Battlestar?\nPenny: What can I say? I got my geek on, boys.\nHoward (after Raj whispers to him): No, no, PMS is different. (There is a knock on the door. Leonard answers it.)\n \nAlicia: Oh, thank God you\u2019re home. I need help.\nLeonard: What\u2019s wrong?\nAlicia: I just got a callback to audition for CSI to play a hooker who gets killed.\nLeonard: Oh, I\u2019d watch that.\nAlicia: But my car is in the shop, and I have to be at Universal in forty-five minutes.\nLeonard: Okay, well, I\u2019ll take you.\nAlicia: Oh, you\u2019re a lifesaver.\nHoward: I\u2019ll run lines with you in the car.\nAlicia: Great. And afterward, I\u2019ll take you all out for Chinese.\nPenny: Oh, actually, that\u2019s okay. we already have\u2026\nHoward: Yum. Starving.\nPenny: \u2026chinese food right here.\nSheldon: They\u2019re gone, Penny. They can\u2019t hear you.\nPenny: I cannot believe they\u2019re letting her just use them like that. I mean, anything she wants, they go panting after her like trained dogs. You know that just last week, she had Howard drive all the way to her uncle\u2019s house in Orange County to pick up her TV?\nSheldon: You once had Leonard and me get your television from your ex-boyfriend.\nPenny: Apples and oranges here, Sheldon. I\u2019m telling you, that girl is a user, iceskating through the life on her looks, taking advantage of innocent weak-willed men, getting auditions for stupid network shows. It creams my corn.\nSheldon: May I interject something here?\nPenny: Please.\nSheldon: You got the wrong mustard.\nScene: The laundry room. \n \nAlicia: Hi.\nPenny:\nAlicia: Guess what? I got the part on CSI.\nPenny: Oh boy.\nAlicia: Something wrong?\nPenny: Uh, no. No, no, no, you know, congratulations, I think you\u2019ll make a great hooker.\nAlicia: Thank you. Hey, I got to ask you something, how much do physicists make?\nPenny: Um, I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t think a lot.\nAlicia: Yeah, that\u2019s what I figured. Well, got to run, the guys promised to set up my satellite dish and paint my bedroom. Yay!\nPenny: Um, hey, hey, can I talk to you about that for a second?\nAlicia: About what?\nPenny: Well, you know, it\u2019s just that Leonard and Howard and Raj, they aren\u2019t like other guys. They\u2019re special.\nAlicia: Okay, they\u2019re special, and?\nPenny: Oh, let\u2019s see, how can I explain this, um, they don\u2019t know how to use their shields.\nAlicia: Shields?\nPenny: Yeah, you know, like in Star Trek, when you\u2019re in battle and you raise the shields? Where the hell did that come from? Anyways, um, you know how guys like this are, so, please don\u2019t take advantage of them.\nAlicia: Who says I\u2019m taking advantage of them?\nPenny: Come on, they\u2019re doing everything for you, because you\u2019re leading them on.\nAlicia: So I let them do stuff for me. They\u2019re happy. I get stuff. Who cares? And how\u2019s it any different from what you do?\nPenny: Excuse me?\nAlicia: I\u2019ve seen you around them. Are you pretending like you don\u2019t do the exact same thing?\nPenny: Okay, lady, you are way out of line.\nAlicia: Oh, I\u2019m out of line?\nPenny: Yeah, you\u2019re out of line.\nAlicia: Well, what are you going to do about it, bitch?\nScene: Outside the building.\nRaj: I like green lantern, I\u2019m just saying it\u2019s pretty lame that He can be defeated by the colour yellow.\nSheldon: Only the modern green lantern is vulnerable to yellow.\nLeonard: Golden age green lantern was vulnerable to wood.\nRaj: Great, so I can take them both out with a number-two pencil?  \nHoward: Oh, my God! Girl fight! (He grabs Leonard)\nLeonard: What are you doing?\nHoward: I know you. you\u2019re stupid enough to break it up.\nScene: The apartment. Penny has a black eye.\n \nHoward: May I say you look very comely tonight?\nPenny: Thank you.\nHoward: You\u2019re right, this filly\u2019s been broken.\nSheldon (as music comes down through ceiling): You set it on DTS, didn\u2019t you?\nLeonard: I had to, she called me cutie.\nHoward: According to Alicia\u2019s facebook page, she\u2019s hooking up with one of the producers on CSI.\nPenny: Well, dead whore on TV, live one in real life.\nSheldon: Oh, great now she\u2019s jumping up and down on the bed.\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "1_4": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: Sheldon and Leonard\u2019s apartment.\nSheldon: I\u2019ve been thinking about time travel again.\nLeonard: Why, did you hit a roadblock with invisibility?\nSheldon: Put it on the back burner. Anyway, it occurs to me, if I ever did perfect a time machine, I\u2019d just go into the past and give it to myself, thus eliminating the need for me to invent it in the first place.\nLeonard: Interesting.\nSheldon: Yeah, it really takes the pressure off. \nLeonard: Sounds like a breakthrough, should I call the science magazines and tell them to hold the front cover? (Exiting the apartment.)\nSheldon: It\u2019s time travel, Leonard, I will have already done that. \nLeonard: Then I guess congratulations are in order.\nSheldon: No, congratulations will have been in order. You know, I\u2019m not going to enjoy this party.\nLeonard: I know, I\u2019m familiar with you.\nSheldon: At the last department party, Dr Finkleday cornered me and talked about spelunking for 45 minutes.\nLeonard: Yes, I was there.\nSheldon: You know what\u2019s interesting about caves, Leonard?\nLeonard: What?\nSheldon: Nothing.\nLeonard: Well then we\u2019ll avoid Finkleday, we\u2019ll meet the new department head, congratulate him, shake his hand and go. \nSheldon: How\u2019s this? Pleased to meet you, Dr Gablehouser. How fortunate for you that the University has chosen to hire you, despite the fact that you\u2019ve done no original research in 25 years, and instead have written a series of popular books that reduce the great concepts of science to a series of anecdotes, each one dumbed down to accommodate the duration of an average bowel movement. Mahalo.\nLeonard: Mahalo\u2019s a nice touch. \nSheldon: Do you know there are only eight consonants in the Hawaiian language.\nLeonard: Interesting, you should lead with that.\nScene: The department party. Sheldon, Raj and Leonard are at the buffet table. \nRaj: Oh, God, Look at this buffet. I love America.\nLeonard: You don\u2019t have buffets in India?\nRaj: Of course, but it\u2019s all Indian food. You can\u2019t find a bagel in Mumbai to save your life. Schmear me.\nSheldon: Well here\u2019s an interesting turn of events.\nLeonard: What. (Sees Howard entering with a statuesque blonde) Howard brought a date?\nSheldon: A more plausible explanation is that his work in robotics has made an amazing leap forward.\nHoward: Hey, what up, science bitches? May I introduce my special lady friend, Summer. (Puts arm around her.)\nSummer: I already told you, touching\u2019s extra.\nHoward: Right. Sorry.\nLeonard (to Sheldon): Here comes our new boss, be polite.\nGablehouser: Hi fellas, Eric Gablehouser.\nHoward: Howard Wolowitz.\nGablehouser: Howard, nice to meet you, and you are?\nSheldon: An actual real scientist. (To Leonard) How was that?\nScene: The stairwell of the apartment building. Sheldon is carrying a box of his things.\nSheldon: I can\u2019t believe he fired me.\nLeonard: Well, you did call him a glorified high-school science teacher whose last successful experiment was lighting his own farts.\nSheldon: In my defence, I prefaced that by saying \u201cwith all due respect.\u201d\nCredit sequence.\nScene: The apartment, Sheldon is in the kitchen cooking, Leonard enters.\nLeonard: Morning\nSheldon: Morning.\nLeonard: You\u2019re making eggs for breakfast?\nSheldon: This isn\u2019t breakfast, it\u2019s an experiment. \nLeonard: Huh? Cos it looks a lot like breakfast.\nSheldon: I finally have the time to test my hypothesis, about the separation of the water molecules from the egg proteins, and its impact vis-a-vis taste.\nLeonard: Sounds yummy. I look forward to your work with bacon.\nSheldon: As do I.\nLeonard: You know, I\u2019m sure if you just apologised to Gablehauser he would give you your job back.\nSheldon: I don\u2019t want my job back. I\u2019ve spent the last three and a half years staring at greaseboards full of equations. Before that I spent four years working on my thesis. Before that I was in college, and before that, I was in the fifth grade. This is my first day off in decades, and I\u2019m going to savour it.\nLeonard: Okay. I\u2019ll let you get back to fixing your eggs.\nSheldon: I\u2019m not just fixing my eggs, I\u2019m fixing everyone\u2019s eggs.\nLeonard: And we all thank you.\n(Sheldon takes his eggs and sits down. Takes a photograph of them. Writes in his notebook, then takes a forkful. Writes in notebook again.)\nSheldon: Use new eggs. (There is a knock on the door).\nPenny (popping her head round): Hi, hey. I\u2019m running out to the market, do you guys need anything?\nSheldon: Oh, well this would be one of those circumstances that people unfamiliar with the law of large numbers would call a coincidence.\nPenny: I\u2019m sorry?\nSheldon: I need eggs. Four dozen should suffice.\nPenny: Four dozen?\nSheldon: Yes, and evenly distributed amongst brown, white, free range, large, extra-large and jumbo.\nPenny: Okay, one more time?\nSheldon: Never mind, you won\u2019t get it right, I\u2019d better come with you.\nPenny: Oh, yay!\nScene: Penny\u2019s car\nPenny: How come you didn\u2019t go into work today.\nSheldon: I\u2019m taking a sabbatical, because I won\u2019t kow-tow to mediocre minds. \nPenny: So you got canned, huh?\nSheldon: Theoretical physicists do not get canned. But yeah. \nPenny: Well, maybe it\u2019s all for the best, you know I always say, when one door closes, another one opens. \nSheldon: No it doesn\u2019t. Not unless the two doors are connected by relays, or there are motion sensors involved. \nPenny: No, no, I meant\u2026\nSheldon: Or the first door closing causes a change of air pressure that acts upon the second door.\nPenny: Never mind. \nSheldon: Slow down. Slow down, please slow down.\nPenny: We\u2019re fine.\nSheldon: Look, you\u2019re not leaving yourself enough space between cars.\nPenny: Oh, sure I am.\nSheldon: No, no. Let me do the math for you, this car weighs let\u2019s say 4,000lb, now add say 140 for me, 120 for you.\nPenny: 120?\nSheldon: Oh, I\u2019m sorry, did I insult you? Is your body mass somehow tied into your self worth?\nPenny: Well, yeah.\nSheldon: Interesting. Anyway, that gives us a total weight of, let\u2019s say, 4,400lb.\nPenny: Let\u2019s say 4,390. \nSheldon: Fine. We\u2019re travelling forward at, good Lord, 51 miles an hour. Now let\u2019s assume that your brakes are new and the callipers are aligned, still, by the time we come to a stop, we\u2019ll be occupying the same space as that Buick in front of us, an impossibility that nature will quickly resolve into death, mutilation and\u2026 oh look, they built a new put-put course.\nScene: The supermarket.\nSheldon: This is great. Look at me, out in the real world of ordinary people, just living their ordinary, colourless, workaday lives. \nPenny: Thank you.\nSheldon: No, thank you. And thank you, ordinary person. Hey, you want to hear an interesting thing about tomatoes.\nPenny: Uh, no, no not really. Listen, didn\u2019t you say you needed some eggs. \nSheldon: Uh, yes, but anyone who knows anything about the dynamics of bacterial growth knows to pick up their refrigerated foods on the way out of the supermarket.\nPenny: Oh, okay, well maybe you should start heading on out then. \nSheldon: No, this is fun. Oh, the thing about tomatoes, and I think you\u2019ll really enjoy this, is, they\u2019re shelved with the vegetables, but they\u2019re technically a fruit. \nPenny: Interesting.\nSheldon: Isn\u2019t it?\nPenny: No, I mean what you find enjoyable. \nSheldon (as Penny selects vitamin supplements): Oh boy.\nPenny: What now?\nSheldon: Well, there\u2019s some value to taking a multivitamin, but the human body can only absorb so much, what you\u2019re buying here are the ingredients for very expensive urine. \nPenny: Well, maybe that\u2019s what I was going for. \nSheldon: Well then you\u2019ll want some manganese.\nScene: On the stairwell of the apartment building. \nSheldon: That was fun. Maybe tomorrow we can go to one of those big warehouse stores. \nPenny: Oh, I don\u2019t know Sheldon, it\u2019s going to take me a while to recover from all the fun I had today. \nSheldon: Are you sure. There are a lot of advantages to buying in bulk. For example, I noticed that you purchase your tampons one month\u2019s supply at a time.\nPenny: What?\nSheldon: Well think about it, it\u2019s a product that doesn\u2019t spoil, and you\u2019re going to be needing them for at least the next thirty years.\nPenny: You want me to buy thirty years worth of tampons?\nSheldon: Well, thirty, thirty five, hey, when did your mother go into menopause?\nPenny: Okay, I\u2019m not talking about this with you.\nSheldon: Oh, Penny, this is a natural human process, and we\u2019re talking about statistically significant savings. Now, if you assume 15 tampons per cycle and a 28 day cycle, are you fairly regular? (Penny shuts door in his face.) Okay, no warehouse store, but we\u2019re still on for put-put golf, right?\nScene: The apartment, Sheldon has several bowls containing goldfish. \nLeonard (entering): Hey, I just ran into Penny, she seemed upset about something.\nSheldon: I think it\u2019s her time of the month. I marked the calendar for future reference. \nLeonard: What\u2019s with the fish?\nSheldon: It\u2019s an experiment. \nLeonard: What happened to your scrambled egg research?\nSheldon: Oh, that was a dead end. Scrambled eggs are as good as they\u2019re ever going to be.\nLeonard: So\u2026 fish. \nSheldon: I read an article about Japanese scientists, who inserted DNA from luminous jellyfish into other animals, and I thought hey, fish nightlights.\nLeonard: Fish nightlights.\nSheldon: It\u2019s a billion dollar idea. Shhhhh!\nLeonard: Mum\u2019s the word. Sheldon, are you sure you don\u2019t want to just apologise to Gablehauser and get your job back.\nSheldon: Oh, no, no, no. No, I\u2019ve too much to do.\nLeonard: Like luminous fish.\nSheldon: Shhhhh!\nLeonard: Right\u2026 I didn\u2019t\u2026.\nSheldon: That\u2019s just the beginning. I also have an idea for a bulk mail-order feminine hygiene company. Oh, glow in the dark tampons! Leonard, we\u2019re going to be rich. \nScene: The stairwell of the apartment building. \nLeonard: Thank you for coming on such short notice.\nMrs Cooper: You did the right thing calling.\nLeonard: I didn\u2019t know what else to do, he\u2019s lost all focus, every day he\u2019s got a new obsession. (They enter the apartment. Sheldon is weaving on a loom. He is wrapped in a poncho.) This is a particularly disturbing one. \nSheldon (looking round): Mommy.\nMrs Cooper: Hi baby.\nSheldon (mouths): You called my mother?\nMrs Cooper: Oh, you got yourself a loom, how nice.\nSheldon: Thank you.\nMrs Cooper: Honey, why did you get a loom?\nSheldon: I was working with luminous fish, and I thought, hey, loom! Mom, what are you doing here?\nMrs Cooper: Leonard called me. \nSheldon: I know, but why?\nLeonard: Because one of the great minds of the twenty-first century is raising glow-in-the-dark fish and weaving sarapes. \nSheldon: This is not a sarape. This is a poncho. A sarape is open at the sides, a poncho is closed, this is a poncho, and neither is a reason to call someone\u2019s mother. \nLeonard: Really, when was the last time you left the house.\nSheldon: I went to the market with Penny.\nLeonard: That was three weeks ago.\nSheldon: Well then buckle up, in the next four to eight days she\u2019s going to get very crabby.\nMrs Cooper: Sweetheart, your little friend is concerned about you.\nSheldon: Yes, well I\u2019m not a child, I\u2019m a grown man capable of living my life as I see fit. And I certainly don\u2019t need someone telling on me to my mother. \nLeonard: Where are you going?\nSheldon: To my room, and no-one\u2019s allowed in. \nMrs Cooper: He gets his temper from his daddy.\nLeonard: Oh. \nMrs Cooper: He\u2019s got my eyes.\nLeonard: I see.\nMrs Cooper: All that science stuff, that comes from Jesus. \nScene: Everyone but Sheldon is in the kitchen of the apartment.\nLeonard: Sheldon? Your mum made dinner.\nSheldon (off): I\u2019m not hungry. \nMrs Cooper: Oh, Leonard, don\u2019t trouble yourself, he\u2019s stubborn. He may stay in there \u2018til the Rapture.\nPenny: Are we so sure that\u2019s a bad thing?\nMrs Cooper: I\u2019ll tell ya, I love the boy to death, but he has been difficult since he fell out of me at the K-Mart. \nHoward: Excuse me for being so bold, but I now see where Sheldon gets his smouldering good looks.\nMrs Cooper: Oh, honey that ain\u2019t going to work, but you keep trying. (To Raj) I made chicken, I hope that isn\u2019t one of the animals that you people think is magic? You know, we have an Indian gentleman at our church, a Dr Patel, it\u2019s a beautiful story, the lord spoke to him, and moved him to give us all 20% off on lasic, you know, those that needed it. \nLeonard: That is a lovely story, um, are we going to do anything about Sheldon?\nMrs Cooper: Oh, we will, you have to take your time with Sheldon. His father, God rest his soul, used to say to me, Mary, you have to take your time with Sheldon. \nLeonard: Sounds like a wise man.\nMrs Cooper: Oh, not so wise, he was trying to fight a bobcat for some licquorish. So, everybody grab a plate, and a pretty place mat that Shelly wove. \nPenny: Has Shelly ever freaked out like this before.\nMrs Cooper: Oh, all the time, I remember one summer when he was thirteen, he built a small nuclear reactor in the shed and told everybody he was going to provide free electricity for the whole town, well the only problem was he had no, whatchacall, fissionable materials. Anyway, when he went on the internets to get some, a man from the government came by and sat him down real gentle and told him it\u2019s against the law to have yellow cake uranium in a shed. \nPenny: What happened?\nMrs Cooper: Well, the poor boy had a fit, locked himself in his room and built a sonic death ray. \nLeonard: A death ray?\nMrs Cooper: Well, that\u2019s what he called it, didn\u2019t even slow down the neighbour kids. It pissed our dog off to no end. You know, you two make a cute couple. \nBoth Leonard and Penny laugh, a little too forced.\nLeonard: No, we\u2019re not, we\u2019re not, not a couple, two singles, like those individually wrapped slices of cheese that\u2026. are friends.\nMrs Cooper: Did I pluck a nerve there?\nHoward: Oh yeah.\nMrs Cooper: Okay. Alright everybody, it\u2019s time to eat. (Everybody begins to do so) Oh Lord, we thank you for this meal, all your bounty, and we pray that you help Sheldon get back on his rocker. (To Raj and Howard) Now after a moment of silent meditation I\u2019m going to end with \u201cIn Jesus\u2019 Name\u201d but you two don\u2019t feel any obligation to join in. Unless, of course, the holy spirit moves you. \nTime shift\nPenny: Oh my God, this is the best cobbler I\u2019ve ever had.\nMrs Cooper: It was always Sheldon\u2019 s favourite. You know what the secret ingredient is?\nPenny: Love?\nMrs Cooper: Lard.\nSheldon emerges from the bedroom area.\nHoward: Hey, look who\u2019s come out\u2026.\nMrs Cooper: Shhh! You\u2019ll spook him. He\u2019s like a baby deer, you gotta let him come to you.\nSheldon crosses to the cobbler, takes some and puts it on a plate. Looks round at the group in the matter of a frightened animal. Everyone but Leonard looks down at their meal.\nLeonard: This is ridiculous. Dammit, Sheldon, snap out of it. You\u2019re a physicist, you belong at the University doing research, not hiding in your room. (Sheldon scuttles away)\nMrs Cooper: You don\u2019t hunt, do you?\nScene: Sheldon\u2019s bedroom. He is building a model of some kind of double helix. There is a knock on the door.\nMrs Cooper (entering): Good morning, snicker-doodle. \nSheldon: Morning.\nMrs Cooper: Oh, well that looks awful fancy, what is that?\nSheldon: It\u2019s my idea of what DNA would look like in a silicon based life form. \nMrs Cooper: But intelligently designed by a creator, right?\nSheldon: What do you want, mom?\nMrs Cooper: You know how your daddy used to say that you can only fish for so long before you got to throw a stick of dynamite in the water?\nSheldon: Yeah.\nMrs Cooper: Well, I\u2019m done fishing. (Throwing a pair of trousers on the bed) You put those on.\nSheldon: What for?\nMrs Cooper: Because you\u2019re going to go down to your office, you\u2019re going to apologise to your boss, and get your job back. \nSheldon: No.\nMrs Cooper: I\u2019m sorry, did I start that sentence with the words \u201cif it please your highness?\u201d\nSheldon: I\u2019m not going to apologise, I didn\u2019t say anything that wasn\u2019t true. \nMrs Cooper: Now you listen here, I have been telling you since you were four years old, it\u2019s okay to be smarter than everybody but you can\u2019t go around pointing it out.\nSheldon: Why not?\nMrs Cooper: Because people don\u2019t like it. Remember all the ass-kickings you got from the neighbour kids? Now let\u2019s get cracking. Shower, shirt, shoes, and let\u2019s shove off. (Exits)\nSheldon: Wouldn\u2019t have been any ass-kickings if that stupid death ray had worked.\nScene: The kitchen\nMrs Cooper: Problem solved. \nLeonard: Really? That\u2019s impressive.\nMrs Cooper: Leonard, the Lord never gives us more than we can handle. Thankfully he blessed me with two other children who are dumb as soup. \nScene: Dr Gablehouser\u2019s office\nMrs Cooper: Excuse me, Dr Gablehouser, are you busy?\nGablehouser: Well, actually\u2026.\nMrs Cooper: Sheldon, he\u2019s just doodling, get in here. \nSheldon: Dr Gablehouser.\nGablehouser: Dr Cooper.\nMrs Cooper: Let\u2019s go, baby, we\u2019re losing daylight. \nSheldon: Um, as you know, several weeks ago in our first encounter we may have gotten off on the wrong foot, when I called you an idiot. And I just wanted to say that I was wrong. To point it out. \nGablehouser (to Mrs Cooper): I\u2019m sorry, we haven\u2019t been introduced. Dr Eric Gablehouser.\nMrs Cooper: Mary Cooper, Sheldon\u2019s mom.\nGablehouser: Now that\u2019s impossible, you must have had him when you were a teenager. \nMrs Cooper: Oh, aren\u2019t you sweet, his father\u2019s dead. \nGablehouser: Recently?\nMrs Cooper: Long enough. \nGablehouser (indicating chair): Please. Sheldon, shouldn\u2019t you be working?\nSheldon (leaving): Okay.\nLeonard: Hey, how did it go?\nSheldon: I got my job back.\nLeonard: Really? What happened?\nSheldon: I\u2019m not quite sure. It involves a part of the human experience that has always eluded me. \nLeonard: That narrows it down. \nScene: Sheldon\u2019s bedroom. Mrs Cooper is tucking him in.\nMrs Cooper: I\u2019m very proud of you honey, you showed a lot of courage today.\nSheldon: Thanks, mom. Mom?\nMrs Cooper: Mmm-hmm?\nSheldon: Is Dr Gablehouser going to be my new daddy?\nMrs Cooper: We\u2019ll see. Sleep tight. \nSheldon turns over to sleep in the glow of a luminous goldfish. \nTeleplay: David Litt & Lee Aronsohn\nStory: Chuck Lorre & Bill Prady\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "2_2": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The building entrance lobby. The guys enter. Sheldon is dressed as a medieval monk, Howard is a court jester, Raj is a medieval gentleman and Leonard is a knight.\nSheldon: Worst Renaissance Fair ever.\nLeonard: Please let it go, Sheldon.\nSheldon: It was rife with historical inaccuracies. For example, the tavern girl serving flagons of mead, now her costume was obviously Germanic, but in 1487 the Bavarian purity laws or Rhineheitsgebot severely limited the availability of mead. At best they would have had some sort of spiced wine.\nLeonard: You\u2019re nitpicking.\nSheldon: Oh-ho! Really? Well here\u2019s another nit for you. The flagons would not have been made of polypropylene.\nHoward: Renaissance fairs aren\u2019t about historical accuracy. They\u2019re about taking chubby girls who work at Kinko\u2019s and lacing them up in corsets so tight their bosom jumps out and says howdy.\nSheldon: Bosoms would not have said howdy in the fifteenth century. If anything they would have said \u201chuzzah!\u201d\nHoward: I don\u2019t care what the bosoms say, Sheldon, I just want to be part of the conversation.\nPenny (arriving with a man in tow): Hi guys. Looks like you\u2019ve been to the Renaissance fair. I\u2019m hoping.\nSheldon: Renaissance fair? More of a medieval slash age of enlightenment slash any excuse to wear a codpiece fair.\nPenny: Okay, fine, whatever, um, you guys, this is my friend Eric.\nHoward: Hello.\nLeonard: Hi.\nEric: Hey.\nLeonard: So, yeah, good to see you.\nPenny: Yeah, yeah, it\u2019s good to see you too. We should really go.\nEric: Yeah.\nPenny(leaving): Bye guys.\nEric (leaving, to Howard): Like your hat.\nHoward: Thanks, my mom made it. Penny with a new guy, tres awkward.\nLeonard: It wasn\u2019t awkward. It wasn\u2019t fun. Besides, what\u2019s the big deal, we dated, we stopped dating, and now we\u2019re both moving on.\nRaj: By moving on, do you mean, she\u2019s going out with other men and you spent the afternoon making fifteenth century soap with Wolowitz?\nSheldon: That was not fifteenth century soap, my God those people need to learn you can\u2019t just put \u201cye olde\u201d in front of anything and expect to get away with it.\nLeonard: Can we please just go in, my chain mail is stuck in my underwear.\nSheldon: You\u2019re wearing modern underwear?\nLeonard: Relatively modern. Why, what are you wearing?\nSheldon: I fashioned historically accurate undergarments out of linen.\nLeonard: You went out and bought linen?\nSheldon: Don\u2019t be silly, I borrowed one of your pillow cases.\nLeonard: Borrowed?\nCredits sequence\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: You know what, I\u2019m happy that Penny\u2019s moving on. It gives me the freedom to move on myself.\nHoward: Are you saying that you\u2019ve been holding back?\nLeonard: Of course. Out of respect.\nHoward: So, how do you explain the ten years before Penny?\nRaj: Who were you respecting then?\nLeonard: What? I\u2019ve dated plenty of women. There was Joyce Kim, Leslie Winkle.\nSheldon: Notify the editors of the Oxford English Dictionary, the word plenty has been redefined to mean two.\nLeonard: Uh, what about that girl last year at Comic-con?\nRaj: Doesn\u2019t count.\nLeonard: Why not?\nRaj: What happens in costume at Comic-con, stays at Comic-con.\nHoward: You\u2019re only saying that because of what happened to you.\nLeonard: What happened to you?\nRaj: N-n-n-nothing happened to me.\nHoward: It wasn\u2019t your fault, Raj, he was dressed as a green Orion slave girl.\nRaj: H-h-h-how did we get on me, we were mocking Leonard for not moving on. Dude, you have totally not moved on.\nLeonard: Yes I have, it\u2019s just a matter of actually making a date with someone.\nHoward: Like who?\nLeonard: Well, there\u2019s Joyce Kim, but she defected back to North Korea so it\u2019s a little geographically undesireable.\nRaj: What about Leslie Winkle.\nSheldon: Oh no.\nRaj: Why?\nSheldon: Her research methodology is sloppy, she\u2019s unjustifiably arrogant about loop quantum gravity, and to make matters worse she\u2019s often mean to me.\nRaj: I think she\u2019s smoking hot.\nHoward: I\u2019d hit that.\nSheldon: You\u2019d hit particulate soil on a colloidal suspension. Mud.\nLeonard: Look, I like Leslie, but she\u2019s not interested in dating as much as using men as tools for stress release.\nHoward: Yeah, so, be a tool. Go get yourself a little rebound stress release.\nRaj: Technically it would only be rebound if he and Penny had actually engaged in physical intimacy.\nHoward: You mean like you and Richard the slave girl?\nRaj: I bought him dinner and we kissed once, that was it. (Leaving) And he told me his name was Kimberley!\nScene: The university cafeteria.\nSheldon: You know how I know we\u2019re not in The Matrix?\nLeonard: How?\nSheldon: If we were, the food would be better.\nLeslie (arriving): Hey, Leonard.\nLeonard: Hey, Leslie.\nLeslie: Hey, dummy.\nSheldon: Hello to you, insufficiently intelligent person.\nLeslie: Ooh, rush me to the burn unit. Hey, Leonard, do you have a second, I need to ask you something.\nLeonard: Uh, sure.\nSheldon: Well, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I\u2019m going to go do work that promises significant results, as opposed to what you do, which does not. Yeah, you heard me.\nLeslie: Wow. So, I heard your relationship with Penny crashed to the ground like blue ice falling out of an airplane lavatory.\nLeonard: Where did you hear that?\nLeslie: Actually I read it. Wolowitz texted me. (Shows him text.) \nLeonard: Like blue ice falling out of an airplane lavatory. Yep.\nLeslie: I thought it was a pretty good one, I gave him an L-O-L. Anyway, it got me thinking, now that you\u2019re unattached maybe we can revisit our previous attachment.\nLeonard: Are you suggesting another bout of stress release.\nLeslie: No, I\u2019m all done with casual sex. From now on I\u2019m fully committed to the traditional relationship paradigm.\nLeonard: Really, what changed?\nLeslie: It\u2019s hard to say, I guess there\u2019s just a time in every woman\u2019s life when she gets tired of waking up on a strange futon with a bunch of people she doesn\u2019t know.\nLeonard: Yeah, I can see how that would\u2026 a bunch of people?\nLeslie: Anyway, I just figure it\u2019s time to slow things down and who better to slow things down with than you?\nLeonard: Oh, I\u2019m flattered. So, how do you suggest we proceed?\nLeslie: Your place, we\u2019ll order Chinese, you\u2019ll rent a movie, artsy but accessible, then light petting, no coitus.\nLeonard: Sounds fun.\nLeslie: I\u2019ll leave the details up to you, I think it\u2019s better if you assume the male role.\nLeonard: Thank you, that\u2019s very thoughtful.\nLeslie: Great. Call me.\nScene: The apartment. Leonard is dressed smartly and placing wine on the table. Sheldon enters.\nSheldon: Great news. My mom sent me my old Nintendo 64.\nLeonard: Terrific.\nSheldon: You know what this means, don\u2019t you? Break out the Red Bull, it\u2019s time to rock Mario old school.\nLeonard: I kind of have other plans tonight.\nSheldon: But it\u2019s Friday. Friday\u2019s always vintage game night. Look, mom included the memory card, we can pick up where I left off in 1999 when I had pernicious anaemia.\nLeonard: Well, the thing is, someone\u2019s coming over.\nSheldon: Well then, no problem, I have three controllers, the more the merrier.\nLeonard: Sheldon, it\u2019s a date, I have a date coming over.\nSheldon: Oh, well you can\u2019t blame me for not jumping to that conclusion.\nLeonard: Why, what\u2019s so unusual about me having a date?\nSheldon: Well, statistically speaking\u2026\nLeonard: Alright, alright. Well, uh, nevertheless, I have one now and I would appreciate it if you would, you know, make yourself scarce.\nSheldon: Leonard, I am a published theoretical physicist with two doctorates and an IQ which can\u2019t be accurately measured by normal tests, how much scarcer could I be?\nLeonard: You know what I mean, could you just give us a little privacy?\nSheldon: You want me to leave the apartment?\nLeonard: Yes.\nSheldon: You mean just go someplace else and be\u2026 someplace else?\nLeonard: Yes.\nSheldon: Well, why should I leave, this is my apartment too.\nLeonard: I know it is, and if science ever discovers a second member of your species and you two would like some privacy I would be more than happy to get out of your way.\nSheldon: Well alright then.\nScene: The entrance lobby. Sheldon is sitting on the bottom step using his laptop. Penny comes down the stairs.\nPenny: Sheldon? What are you doing?\nSheldon: Playing Super Mario on a poorly coded Nintendo 64 emulator.\nPenny: Yeah, but why are you doing it on the stairs?\nSheldon: I\u2019m a modern day Napoleon exiled to the Elba of the staircase because Leonard, get this, has a date.\nPenny: Oh. Oh, well, good for him. Yeah but, why are you sitting here, why don\u2019t you just go to a movie or something?\nSheldon: Alone?\nPenny: Yeah, why not?\nSheldon: What if I choke on my popcorn, who will administer the Heimlich manoeuvre.\nPenny: Well then don\u2019t order popcorn.\nSheldon: No popcorn at the mo\u2026 listen to yourself.\nPenny: Well why don\u2019t you go to a coffee shop.\nSheldon: I don\u2019t drink coffee.\nPenny: They have other things.\nSheldon: What do they have?\nPenny: I don\u2019t know, you know, cookies, pastries\u2026\nSheldon: Pastries such as bearclaws?\nPenny: Yeah, sure.\nSheldon: I don\u2019t like bearclaws.\nLeslie (entering): Heya Penny. Dumbass.\nSheldon: Leslie Winkle. Of all the overrated physicists in all the labs in all the world, why does it have to be Leslie Winkle?\nPenny: Well, they have a lot in common. I mean they\u2019re both scientists.\nSheldon: Oh please. The only way she could make a contribution to science would be if they resume sending chimps into space.\nPenny: Okay, well I have a date too, so see ya.\nSheldon: Everybody has a date. Even you, Mario, going after Princess Peach. And what am I doing, I\u2019m just enabling you.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeslie: This is pretty good Orange Chicken.\nLeonard: Yeah, it\u2019s from Changs.\nLeslie: Not Chows?\nLeonard: No, Changs.\nLeslie: What happened to Chows?\nLeonard: It changed.\nLeslie: Oh. So, how many children do you think we should have? (Leonard splutters and coughs) I\u2019m sorry, that was a little abrupt.\nLeonard: A little.\nLeslie: I mean there are so many things to talk about before we discuss reproduction.\nLeonard: I sure hope so.\nLeslie: Besides shortness, what genetic weaknesses run in your family?\nSheldon (entering): I\u2019m sorry to interrupt, batteries dying continue.\nLeslie: Uh, genetic weaknesses, right, um, there\u2019s the lactose intolerance.\nSheldon (preparing an extension cord): Don\u2019t forget the male pattern baldness. When his uncles sit around the dinner table they look like a half carton of eggs. (Exits. Extension cord trails after him. Eventually goes tight a couple of times then falls loose.)\nLeonard: Okay, now my uncles are bald, but my Aunt Edna is one of the hairiest women you will ever meet. So\u2026 Sweet lady. It always tickles when she hugs me. (Sheldon knocks and enters again.) What now?\nSheldon: I have to make pee-pee.\nTime shift to later.\nLeonard: Listen, I\u2019m sorry about all of Sheldon\u2019s interruptions, he can be a bit of an eccentric.\nLeslie: If by eccentric you mean passive-aggressive East Texas blowhole, I agree.\nLeonard: Well, I think tonight was a very good start.\nLeslie: Me too. You\u2019re sure you\u2019re okay postponing intercourse until our relationship is past the initial viability test?\nLeonard: No problem, I\u2019m very skilled at postponing intercourse. So I guess I\u2019ll call you and we\u2019ll arrange another evening.\nLeslie: Yes. I believe protocol dictates that you wait a minimum of 18 hours before you call so I\u2019m not repulsed by your cloying eagerness.\nLeonard: Sure.\nLeslie: Again, it\u2019s your decision, you\u2019re the man.\nPenny (voice off, ascending the stairs): No, it wasn\u2019t my cat, it was an experiment designed by this guy named Schrodinger.\nEric (appearing round corner with Penny): From the Charlie Brown cartoons?\nPenny: No, he was some kind of scientist, let me start again. Oh, hey Leonard.\nLeonard: Hello.\nPenny: Leslie.\nLeslie: Hi.\n(Penny turns and crosses hall.)\nLeonard: Okay, well, goodnight. (Leans in to kiss Leslie.)\nPenny: Okay, well, goodnight. (Grabs Eric and kisses him more passionately.) \nLeslie (whispering): That ain\u2019t going to make your point. (Grabs him and tries to out-passion Penny. The two couples get more passionate trying to outdo each other until Leonard grabs Leslie\u2019s ass.) Okay, that\u2019s enough. (Sweetly) Call me (exits.)\nLeonard: Right (goes back inside flat. Closes door.)\nPenny (breaking off kiss): Okay, goodnight.\nEric: What?\nPenny: Had a great time, ciao (closes door.)\nScene: The university lunch room.\nSheldon: I\u2019m sorry, I am not going back to the Renaissance Fair.\nHoward: Come on, Sheldon, there\u2019s so few places I can wear my jester costume.\nSheldon: I don\u2019t care. There are far too many historical anomalies for my comfort.\nRaj: Oh, okay, how about this. You can go dressed as a Star Trek science officer exploring a planet similar to Earth in the 1500s.\nSheldon: You mean like Spock?\nRaj: Sure.\nSheldon: Fascinating.\nLeslie (arriving): Hey fellow scientists. Sheldon.\nLeonard: Hey, why don\u2019t we all move over there so Leslie can join us.\nHoward: Hmm, let\u2019s do it. (Sheldon does not move. Leonard looks confused.)\nSheldon: If you\u2019re having trouble deciding where to sit may I suggest one potato two potato, or as I call it the Leslie Winkle experimental methodology.\nLeonard: Don\u2019t make this hard for me.\nSheldon: It\u2019s not hard. It\u2019s simple. You can either sit with me, your friend, colleague and roommate, or you can sit with an overrated scientist you might have sex with.\nLeonard: You\u2019re right, it is simple. (Sits with Leslie.)\nScene: The stairs. Sheldon is playing on his computer at the end of the long extension cord.\nPenny: Hey, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Penny.\nPenny: Third floor tonight. Mixing it up? (Sheldon indicates extension cord.) Oh. You know, I still don\u2019t understand why you just don\u2019t go to dinner or something.\nSheldon: Alright, let\u2019s say I go to dinner alone. And during the meal I have to use the rest room. How do I know someone\u2019s not touching my food?\nPenny: Goodnight Sheldon.\nSheldon: Penny, hold on. Are you sure things can\u2019t work out with you and Leonard?\nPenny: Excuse me?\nSheldon: I\u2019m just wondering if you really gave it the old college try? Or in your case the old community college try?\nPenny: Okay, where is this coming from?\nSheldon: Leonard is upstairs right now with my arch enemy.\nPenny: Your arch enemy?\nSheldon: Yes, the Doctor Doom to my Mr Fantastic. The Doctor Octopus to my Spiderman. The Doctor Sivana to my Captain Marvel.\nPenny: Okay, I get it, I get it, I get it.\nSheldon: Do you know, it\u2019s amazing how many supervillains have advanced degrees. Graduate school should probably do a better job of screening those people out.\nPenny: Sheldon, come back, you\u2019re losing me.\nSheldon: Leslie Winkle, Penny. She belittles my research.\nPenny: Oh, sweetie, I\u2019m sorry.\nSheldon: She called me dumbass.\nPenny: I know. I heard.\nSheldon: Given this situation, I have no choice but to withdraw my previous objections to your ill considered relationship with Leonard.\nPenny: Oh, gee, well, thankyou for that. But, um, I think for now Leonard and I are just going to stay friends.\nSheldon: No, that response is unacceptable to me.\nPenny: Sheldon, you are a smart guy, you must know\u2026\nSheldon: Smart? I\u2019d have to lose 60 IQ points to be classified as smart.\nPenny: Are you going to let me talk?\nSheldon: I\u2019m sorry.\nPenny: You must know that if Leonard and Leslie want to be together, nothing you can do is going to stop it.\nSheldon: You continue to underestimate my abilities madam.\nPenny: Okay, let me put it this way, if you\u2019re really Leonard\u2019s friend you will support him no matter who he wants to be with.\nSheldon: Wait a minute, why am I doing all the giving here? If Leonard\u2019s really my friend, why doesn\u2019t he have to support me in my hatred of Leslie Winkle?\nPenny: Because love trumps hate.\nSheldon: Oh now you\u2019re just making stuff up.\nPenny: Okay. Goodnight Sheldon.\nSheldon: Oh Mario. If only I could control everyone the way I control you. Hop, you little plumber, hop, hop, hop.\nScene: The apartment. Leonard and Leslie are kissing. \nSheldon (entering): When the two of you reach a natural stopping point I\u2019d like to have a word.\nLeonard: If the word is pee-pee, just do it.\nSheldon: Leonard, you are my friend. And friends support their friends, apparently. So I am withdrawing my objection to your desire to have a relationship with Leslie.\nLeonard: Thank you.\nSheldon: I will graciously overlook the fact that she is an arrogant sub-par scientist, who actually believes loop quantum gravity better unites quantum mechanics with general relativity than does string theory. You kids have fun.\nLeslie: Hang on a second. Loop quantum gravity clearly offers more testable predictions than string theory.\nSheldon: I\u2019m listening, amuse me.\nLeslie: Okay, well, for one thing we expect quantii space-time to manifest itself as minute differences in the speed of light for different colours.\nSheldon: Balderdash. Matter clearly consists of tiny strings.\nLeslie: Are you going to let him talk to me like that?\nLeonard: Okay, well, there is a lot of merit to both theories.\nLeslie: No there isn\u2019t, only loop quantum gravity calculates the entropy of black holes. (Sheldon grunts.)\nLeonard: Sheldon, don\u2019t make that noise, it\u2019s disrespectful.\nSheldon: I hope so, it was a snort of derision.\nLeslie: You agree with me, right, loop quantum gravity is the future of physics.\nLeonard: Sorry Leslie, I guess I prefer my space stringy not loopy.\nLeslie: Well, I\u2019m glad I found out the truth about you before this went any further.\nLeonard: Truth, what truth? We\u2019re talking about untested hypotheses, uh, it\u2019s no big deal.\nLeslie: Oh, it isn\u2019t, really? Tell me Leonard, how would we raise the children?\nLeonard: I guess we let them wait until they\u2019re old enough and let them choose their own theory.\nLeslie: We can\u2019t let them choose, Leonard, they\u2019re children. (Storms off.)\nLeonard: Wait, where are you going?\nLeslie: I\u2019m sorry, I could have accepted our kids being genetically unable to eat ice-cream or ever get a good view of a parade, but this? This is a deal breaker. (Leaves.)\nSheldon: Look on the bright side.\nLeonard: What\u2019s the bright side?\nSheldon: Only nine more months to comic-con.\nLeonard: Oh yeah.\nScene: The Renaissance Fair. The guys are in costume. Sheldon is Spock and has a tri-corder.\nSheldon: Captain, I\u2019m getting an unusual reading.\nLeonard: Yeah, that\u2019s great, you guys want corn dogs?\nHoward: Yeah.\nSheldon: That\u2019s a temporal anomaly. Corn dogs didn\u2019t come into existence until the first half of the twentieth century.\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "6_21": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Oh, dear. Penny, have you been recording shows on our DVR again?\nPenny: No.\nSheldon: Answer honestly. This is not a trial. That\u2019ll come later.\nPenny: Absolutely not. Help me out here, I can\u2019t afford another demerit.\nLeonard: Yeah. Uh, maybe we were hacked. You know, the Chinese have been hacking everything lately.\nSheldon: Why would the Chinese make our DVR record Paul Blart: Mall Cop?\nLeonard: I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s a fat guy on a Segway. That\u2019s funny everywhere.\nSheldon: I\u2019m deleting it.\nPenny: Well, hang on. Maybe the Chinese haven\u2019t finished watching it yet.\nLeonard: You know, if you\u2019re trying to make space on the DVR, why don\u2019t you just get rid of some of the stuff you\u2019ve already watched? Like, um, Alphas.\nSheldon: No, that\u2019s the season two finale. That was quite the cliffhanger. I\u2019m going to re-watch it before season three starts.\nLeonard: There is no season three. They cancelled that show.\nSheldon: Well, they can\u2019t cancel it. It ended on a cliffhanger.\nLeonard: They did.\nPenny: Uh, Sheldon, there are two dumplings left. Do you want them?\nSheldon: Dumplings? Don\u2019t you understand what\u2019s going on here?\nPenny: As a rule, no.\nSheldon: That show ended with all the residents of New York either dead or unconscious. Oh, now I\u2019ll never know what happened.\nPenny: Well, why don\u2019t you make up your own ending?\nSheldon: Oh, sure, what a wonderful idea. And after that, I\u2019ll make up my own rules of oral hygiene. You know, instead of flossing, I\u2019ll rub pudding on my gums. I\u2019m going to get the number of the SyFy Channel and give them what for.\nLeonard: Oh, please, don\u2019t do that.\nSheldon: No. They can\u2019t just cancel a show like Alphas. You know? They have to help the viewers let go. Firefly did a movie to wrap things up. Buffy the Vampire Slayer continued on as a comic book. Heroes gradually lowered the quality season by season till we were grateful it ended.\nPenny: I feel bad for whoever gets that phone call.\nLeonard: Ah, don\u2019t. If they didn\u2019t want to be yelled at by crazy nerds, they shouldn\u2019t have started a sci-fi channel.\nCredits sequence\nScene: Raj\u2019s apartment.\nHoward: I think you\u2019re gonna be really happy with this security camera. The optics are great, it\u2019s got infrared technology, and there\u2019s even a backup battery when the power goes out.\nRaj: Whatever. I can see my little princess while I\u2019m at work, right?\nHoward: Why can\u2019t you just watch porn like a regular guy? I need your laptop so I can configure the software.\nRaj: Wait, hold on. This is weird.\nHoward: What?\nRaj: I was Googling that girl I\u2019ve been dating, and I found her blog.\nHoward: Cool. Anything juicy?\nRaj: She said she recently went on a date with a guy named Roger? And he\u2019s Indian? And he\u2019s an astrophysicist, too?\nHoward: You know what\u2019s going on, don\u2019t you?\nRaj: Yes, Mummy was right. American girls are sexually voracious devils.\nHoward: I can\u2019t believe I have to explain this. People change names on blogs to protect their privacy. Roger is Raj.\nRaj: Oh. I always thought, if I had a white name, it would be Gavin.\nHoward: Keep reading. What does it say?\nRaj: No, no, I don\u2019t know if I should. If she wanted me to know about her blog, she would\u2019ve told me. It\u2019s almost like I\u2019m reading her diary.\nHoward: It\u2019s exactly what it\u2019s like. Keep reading.\nRaj: No, this is creepy.\nHoward: Oh, I think we were looking at creepy in the rearview mirror when I put up that camera.\nRaj: It\u2019s not creepy. Don\u2019t listen to him. Oh, look who\u2019s got the sweetest kisses.\nHoward: Should I go?\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment.\nLeonard: With all the TV Sheldon was talking about, I had the greatest idea ever. It even blows away my idea for a Star Wars themed coffee shop called Brewbacca\u2019s. You need to watch Buffy the Vampire Slayer. It is the perfect show for the two of us. It\u2019s got action and jokes and hot vampires and romance. I cannot oversell this. What do you say?\nPenny: It\u2019s six thirty in the morning.\nLeonard: I thought you grew up on a farm.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon (on phone): Hello, SyFy Network? Yeah, this is your vice president of programming. Now, we have made a horrible mistake regarding Alphas. Yeah, we need to uncancel it immediately. Well, you just put me through to the people who handle that, you tell them it\u2019s me, and I don\u2019t want to answer a lot of questions about if I really am who I say I am, you know? I just. I want this done. No, I am not the person who just called. That man was clearly a cowboy. Yeah, who was plumb concerned about y\u2019all cancelling his favourite show. Why do they keep hanging up on me?\nAmy: I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re upset. You know, Sheldon, sometimes people seek the comfort of physical contact in moments like this.\nSheldon: I am not flying back to Texas just so my mom can give me a hug.\nAmy: Okay. Well, what I think is going on here is you have a pathological need for closure.\nSheldon: Oh, that\u2019s nonsense. I mean, you tell me stories about your day all the time. I don\u2019t care how they end.\nAmy: You know, I might be able to help you with this. There\u2019s a whole field of behavioural neuroscience that examines ways to retrain your neural pathways so stuff like this bothers you less.\nSheldon: Yeah, but I just told you, I don\u2019t have a problem with closure.\nAmy: You sure about that?\nSheldon: Oh, quite sure. (Amy starts a knocking sequence on the table. After staring at her a moment, Sheldon completes it.) That proves nothing.\nScene: Raj\u2019s office.\nHoward: Ready to go to lunch?\nRaj: Do you think I\u2019m feminine?\nHoward: Yeah. Let\u2019s go.\nRaj: Thanks a lot.\nHoward: What\u2019s going on?\nRaj: I broke down, and I read Lucy\u2019s blog, and in one of the entries she said, when we first met, I struck her as a little feminine.\nHoward: Just a little? That\u2019s great.\nRaj: I have to talk to her about this.\nHoward: Oh, geez, why do you girls always want to talk about things? Listen to me, if she\u2019s writing about your relationship, use it to your advantage. Rig the game.\nRaj: Well, that doesn\u2019t seem fair.\nHoward: Is it fair that girls like confident, normal guys more than nervous weirdos?\nRaj: No, it\u2019s not. I\u2019ve always thought that was unfair.\nHoward: So take what\u2019s in that blog and use it to get her pants off.\nRaj: Why do you have to make everything so filthy? Why couldn\u2019t you just say the blog is like her giving me the key to her heart?\nHoward: The key to her heart. That\u2019s nice. Were you quoting someone or is it tattooed on the small of your back?\nRaj: I was quoting a man who knows a thing or two about women, Sir Elton John.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment.\nLeonard: So, did you love it? Of course you loved it. How could you not love it? Tell me how much you loved it.\nPenny: It was cute.\nLeonard: Oh, don\u2019t say cute. That\u2019s the worst.\nPenny: What\u2019s wrong with cute?\nLeonard: It just makes things seem small. It diminishes them.\nPenny: So you want me to stop calling your little tushy cute?\nLeonard: You can try, but nobody\u2019s gonna believe you. I just, I don\u2019t understand how you can watch a show that great and not be excited by it.\nPenny: I liked it. I\u2019m excited.\nLeonard: Well, then, tell your face.\nPenny: What do you want from me?\nLeonard: You know what? Never mind. We gave it a shot. Let\u2019s just see what else is on.\nPenny: Oh, come on, don\u2019t be like that.\nLeonard: Well\u2026\nPenny: I\u2019m sorry I called it cute. Let\u2019s watch another one.\nLeonard: Really?\nPenny: Yeah, it was fun. Kind of reminded me of my high school. But instead of vampires, we had meth heads. But both came out at night and had messed up teeth.\nLeonard: All right, cool. I think you\u2019ll like the next one better. All the cheerleaders are suffering from an evil curse.\nPenny: Oh. Well, that\u2019s like my high school, too. But instead of a curse, it was crabs.\nScene: The apartment.\nAmy: I\u2019ve come up with a series of exercises to help with your compulsive need for closure.\nSheldon: I take issue with the word compulsive.\nAmy: All I\u2019m saying is, we live in a world where closure isn\u2019t always an op\u2026\nSheldon: \u2026tion. Okay. For the sake of argument, let\u2019s say I have a problem. What would be your plan for addressing it?\nAmy: I\u2019m going to recondition your brain so that the need for completion isn\u2019t so overwhelming.\nSheldon: By playing tic-tac-toe?\nAmy: Yep. Your turn.\nSheldon: Oh, Amy. And you wonder why people think neuroscience is nothing but a goofy game for diaper babies. Tic-tac-toe can only end in win, lose or draw, none of which will deny me closure. Especially since I\u2019m about to win. (She wipes the board clean.) B-But we didn\u2019t finish.\nAmy: Exactly. How does that make you feel?\nSheldon: The same way any normal person would. I feel like I want to peel off my own face and tear it in two and then again and again until I have a handful of Sheldon-face confetti.\nAmy: And that\u2019s exactly the feeling we want to address with this course of treatment.\nSheldon: Or you could pitch in, grab a nostril and help me get this face off.\nAmy: Come on, you can do this.\nSheldon: You don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to feel completely frustrated. To have a desire build up within you and be denied any opportunity for release.\nAmy: Yeah, sounds like a drag.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment.\nPenny: Okay, help me out here. Why does he love this show so much?\nBernadette: Well, there was action, it was funny. I mean, you do get that usually the monster chases the pretty girl, but this time the pretty girl chases the monsters?\nPenny: Yippee, it\u2019s backwards. I get it.\nBernadette: Why does this bother you so much?\nPenny: I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s just, he\u2019s so passionate about so many different things. I just don\u2019t get that way. Do you?\nBernadette: Well, sure. I\u2019m pretty passionate about science. I remember the first time I looked through a microscope and saw millions of tiny microorganisms. It was like a whole other universe. If I wanted to, I could wipe it out with my thumb like a god.\nPenny: See? I wish I had some of that fire in my life. I mean, I want to care about things and get excited like you guys.\nBernadette: Well, there\u2019s no reason you can\u2019t.\nPenny: You think?\nBernadette: Absolutely. All we need to do is spend a little time and find something you\u2019re passionate about.\nPenny: Ugh, that sounds like a lot of work.\nScene: Raj\u2019s apartment. \nHoward (on webcam): Hey, what\u2019s up?\nRaj: Uh, Lucy\u2019s coming over. I need some advice.\nHoward: However long you think the foreplay should be, triple it.\nRaj: Just tell me which one you think is more manly. This hockey jersey or this football jersey.\nHoward: I don\u2019t know. Go with hockey.\nRaj: Good, black is more slimming. Oh, that\u2019s her. I got to go be butch. Toodles. Hey.\nLucy: Hi.\nRaj: Come in.\nLucy: Oh, look how cute your little doggy is.\nRaj: Yeah, well, I wouldn\u2019t get too close. If I give the right command in German, she\u2019ll rip your face off.\nScene: The apartment. Montage of scenes.\n1. Amy (singing): O\u2019er the land of the free, and the home of the\u2026 Next.\n2. (Sheldon is laying out an intricate pattern of dominoes) Amy: That\u2019s quite an impressive layout, isn\u2019t it?\nSheldon: Yes.\nAmy: Let\u2019s box it up.\nSheldon: Let\u2019s box it up.\n3. (Sheldon is turning the handle on a jack-in-the-box. Just before the end of the tune) Amy: That\u2019s enough. Sheldon, Sheldon, give it!\n4. Amy: Okay, Sheldon, make a wish and blow out the candles. Oops, missed one. Now your wish can\u2019t come true.\nSheldon: Lucky for you, \u2019cause I wished you were dead.\nScene: Raj\u2019s apartment.\nLucy: I like your jersey.\nRaj: Thanks. I love hockey.\nLucy: Oh, cool. So does my dad. We watched it all the time growing up. Who\u2019s your favourite player?\nRaj: Not Brian Boitano, that\u2019s for sure. How\u2019s your burrito?\nLucy: It\u2019s still a little frozen in the middle.\nRaj: Probably because I didn\u2019t read the instructions. No wrapper\u2019s going to tell me what to do. Unless his name is Jay-Z.\nLucy: Is something going on?\nRaj: What do you mean?\nLucy: Well, you\u2019re acting all weird, and I\u2019m pretty weird, so I think I know what I\u2019m talking about.\nRaj: I don\u2019t know. Maybe it\u2019s all those steroids I\u2019ve been taking.\nLucy: I think I\u2019m gonna go. Thank you for the burrito and the pork rinds and the 20-minute lecture on why monster trucks are better than regular trucks.\nRaj: Wait, wait. I, I found your blog here you wrote about me.\nLucy: Oh. I kind of just write that for myself. I didn\u2019t think anybody actually read it.\nRaj: No kidding. You didn\u2019t make it easy to find. I spent hours digging around online. For the record, you have excellent credit scores. And your diabetic aunt seems to be adjusting to her new leg just fine.\nLucy: Why were you acting so strange tonight?\nRaj: You called me feminine. And I, I wanted you to think I was more manly.\nLucy: Raj, I didn\u2019t say feminine was a bad thing. I meant that you\u2019re sweet and thoughtful and your skin looks so much like caramel, I just want to dip an apple in your face.\nRaj: I do have a pretty balls-to-the-wall moisturising regimen.\nLucy: So, are you okay?\nRaj: Yeah.\nLucy: Good. Do you even like hockey?\nRaj: No. Bought this at the Staples Center when I went to see Taylor Swift.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment. \nPenny: So, I was thinking how excited you get about stuff like Buffy or science or which TV remote you and Sheldon should buy.\nLeonard: The Harmony One was fine. We didn\u2019t need to upgrade to the eleven hundred, which he knows is too big for my hand.\nPenny: See, that\u2019s the kind of passion I didn\u2019t think I had. But then I realized I\u2019m passionate about you.\nLeonard: Oh, my cute little tushy strikes again.\nPenny: No, I\u2019m serious. Look, I\u2019ve always had these plans. I was gonna be in movies and live this glamorous life, and anything less than that just wasn\u2019t worth getting excited about.\nLeonard: Those things can still happen.\nPenny: Oh, obviously it\u2019s gonna happen. Yeah, a psychic at a bachelorette party told me so. Anyway, what I meant was, I shouldn\u2019t wait, you know? I\u2019ve got you, I\u2019ve got Sheldon, all these wonderful friends. My life is exciting right now.\nLeonard: That\u2019s a big deal.\nPenny: It is, isn\u2019t it?\nLeonard: So, does that mean we get to do stuff like talk about cool shows or get dressed up in matching costumes and go to Comic-Con?\nPenny: Leonard, I had an epiphany, not a stroke.\nScene: The apartment. \nSheldon: Amy, I must say, I was sceptical at first, but this has truly been a transformative evening.\nAmy: I\u2019m a little surprised to hear you feeling so positive.\nSheldon: Well, you\u2019re an excellent neuroscientist, you\u2019re a wonderful girlfriend, and\u2026\nAmy: And?\nSheldon: Doesn\u2019t matter, does it?\nAmy: I\u2019m proud of you, Sheldon. (Exits.)\nSheldon: And a complete sucker.\n(Montage of sccenes)\n1. (Redraws tic-tac-toe board) Sheldon: Oh, yeah.\n2. (Blows out all candles on the cake)\n3. (Winds up jack-in-the-box until it pops out.) Sheldon: There he is.\n4. Sheldon (singing): And the home of the brave.\n5. (Knocks over first of intricate domino pattern) Sheldon: Don\u2019t stop. Yes, keep going. Just like that.\nAlmost there, almost there. Uh-huh-huh!\nPenny: Sheldon, you big weirdo, I want you to know that I love that you\u2019re in my life.\nSheldon: I love you, too.\nScene: Later.\nSheldon: Hello. Uh, is this the Bruce Miller who wrote the season finale of Alphas? Oh, smashing. Yeah, you already sound nicer than the last Bruce Miller who suggested I have sexual relations with myself. Now, down to business. Um, your show ended on a cliffhanger. Could you please tell me how you planned to resolve it? Uh-huh. Mm-hmm. I see. Well, that all stinks. No wonder you got cancelled. Bye.\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "6_22": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: The interface is pretty simple. You put your horizontal X coordinate here, vertical Y coordinate here. When you\u2019re happy with those, you press this button.\nPenny: Got it.\nSheldon: Leonard, you\u2019ll never guess who I just found online. Hey!\nLeonard: Nice shot.\nPenny: Eh, his giant head did most of the work.\nSheldon: Very mature. You\u2019re lucky I\u2019m out of silly string. As I was saying, Leonard, you\u2019ll never guess who I just found online. Professor Proton.\nLeonard: You\u2019re kidding. He\u2019s still alive?\nSheldon: Yes.\nPenny: Who\u2019s Professor Proton?\nLeonard: He was the host of this great\u2026 Hey!\nPenny: Yes! Sorry, tell me about Professor Proton.\nSheldon: Professor Proton hosted my favourite science show when I was a child. I never missed an episode. He demonstrated scientific principles using everyday objects.\nLeonard: It was pretty cool.\nPenny: Aw, so cute when you use the word cool wrong. Like when kids say pasghetti.\nSheldon: Oh, dear lord, Leonard, look. He\u2019s still available for parties and events. We should hire him.\nLeonard: Hire him to do what?\nSheldon: Well, whatever we want. Hang out, do experiments, make him take 12 pictures with us so we can make a calendar.\nLeonard: It would be pretty awesome to hang out with him. I just used awesome wrong, didn\u2019t I?\nSheldon: Well, I\u2019m e-mailing him right now.\nLeonard: Do you remember his old theme song?\nSheldon: Of course I do.\nTogether: Grab your goggles, put your lab coat on, here he comes, Professor Proton.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The cafeteria.\nRaj: Hey, I just found out I have to be at the telescope lab all weekend. Any chance you and Bernadette could take care of my dog?\nHoward: Why don\u2019t you put her in a kennel?\nRaj: Why don\u2019t you put your mother in a home?\nHoward: To be honest, she\u2019d do better in the kennel. I\u2019ll talk to Bernie. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s fine.\nRaj: Thank you.\nSheldon: It\u2019s happening. Leonard, it\u2019s happening. Professor Proton is coming to our house.\nLeonard: You\u2019re kidding.\nHoward: You mean the guy who used to host that lame kids show?\nSheldon: And you just got yourself uninvited. See? I told you I\u2019d find a tactful way to do that.\nHoward: How\u2019d you get him to come to your house?\nSheldon: As Professor Proton always says, there is no problem you can\u2019t solve if you use your noggin.\nLeonard: And he wrote him a cheque.\nSheldon: Yeah, that, too. Big cheque.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s apartment.\nRaj: Uncle Howard. Cinnamon\u2019s here for her sleepover party.\nHoward: You know if you had a stroke, she\u2019d eat you, right?\nRaj: And it would be my pleasure to be her num-num.\nHoward: Okay, so what do I need to know to take care of her?\nRaj: It\u2019s very simple. For breakfast, she has an egg-white frittata. Feel free to give her a choice of home fries or an English muffin, but not both. We\u2019re watching our weight. Uh, for dinner, something simple, a veal chop, some scampi, whatever you like.\nHoward: Classy dog.\nRaj: Yes. Also, don\u2019t forget to close the toilet or she\u2019ll drink out of it.\nHowatd: I feel for ya. I\u2019ve got a psychotic mommy, too.\nScene: Leonard\u2019s bedroom.\nSheldon (off): Leonard, are you in bed?\nLeonard: Yes.\nSheldon (off): Me, too.\nLeonard: Great.\nSheldon (off): I can\u2019t sleep.\nLeonard: Well, I can, so shut up.\nSheldon (off): Do you realize that in less than nine hours, Arthur Jeffries, aka Professor Proton, will be in our apartment?\nLeonard: Sheldon, you know that if you stay up all night, you\u2019re gonna be sleepy tomorrow. And a sleepy Sheldon is a cranky Sheldon. And a cranky Sheldon is actually no different than a regular Sheldon. Good night.\nSheldon (off): I\u2019m thinking of wearing a tuxedo.\nLeonard: That\u2019s not ridiculous. Good night.\nSheldon (off): Do you have cufflinks?\nLeonard: No.\nSheldon (off): Ah, just as well. Where can you rent a tuxedo at three o\u2019clock in the morning?\nLeonard: Okay, good night.\nSheldon (off): Nice to meet you, Professor Proton. Nice to meet you, Professor Proton. Nice to meet you, Professor Proton. Nice to meet you, Prof\u2026 Ow! Leonard?\nLeonard: What?\nSheldon (off): I still can\u2019t sleep.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s apartment.\nHoward: She really tuckered herself out at the park, huh?\nBernadette: Yeah, you two were so cute playing together.\nHoward: It was kind of fun throwing a ball and not having anyone laugh at me.\nBernadette: And you were sweet not to throw it too far so she didn\u2019t wear out her tiny legs.\nHoward: Yeah, that\u2019s what I was doing.\nBernadette: You know, there were a few moments today when I almost felt like we were a little family.\nHoward: Really?\nBernadette: Yeah. I never thought of myself as a mom, but when the three of us were out there having fun, I felt like maybe someday we could do it.\nHoward: Of course we can. Especially if our baby\u2019s as calm and quiet as little Cinna\u2026 Son of a bitch, she\u2019s gone.\nBernadette: Where\u2019d she go?\nHoward: I don\u2019t know, she didn\u2019t leave a note.\nBernadette: Well, you were the one who was supposed to put her back in the stroller.\nHoward: No, I wasn\u2019t. You were.\nBernadette: No, I wasn\u2019t.\nHoward: Yes, you were!.\nBernadette: Yeah, well, you throw like a girl.\nScene: The apartment. \nSheldon: I\u2019m getting worried.\nPenny: Relax, Sheldon, he\u2019s only a few minutes late.\nSheldon: Professor Proton was never late when he was on TV. You know, every day, four o\u2019clock, he was there. Unless tornadoes were ripping apart East Texas, in which case we\u2019d join him in progress. (Phone rings) It\u2019s him. Hello. Well, I see. Yes. All right, we can come get you. Yeah, well, see you soon. Bye.\nLeonard: Where is he?\nSheldon: The third floor landing. The poor old guy\u2019s been walking up the stairs for half an hour. It\u2019s really you.\n(On the third floor landing)\nLeonard: Mr. Jeffries, I am so sorry. We should\u2019ve told you about the broken elevator.\nArthur: I agree.\nSheldon: Professor Proton, it\u2019s an honour to meet you.\nArthur: Just, just call me Arthur.\nSheldon: Leonard, you hear that? Professor Proton said I should call him Arthur. That means we\u2019re friends.\nArthur: No. A friend would\u2019ve, would\u2019ve told me about the elevator.\nSheldon: Look at me. I can get as close to you as I want without my mom saying it\u2019s going to ruin my eyes.\nArthur: Is, uh, is he dangerous?\nLeonard: Actually, he\u2019s a genius.\nSheldon: I am.\nArthur: That doesn\u2019t answer my question.\nLeonard: Mr. Jeffries, I\u2019m, I\u2019m Leonard. This is my girlfriend, Penny.\nArthur: Hi.\nPenny: Hello.\nArthur: Well, I hope I haven\u2019t, uh, kept the kids waiting too long for, for the show.\nSheldon: Oh, no, there are no kids. No, the, the show\u2019s for me. Come on. I\u2019ll race ya, Arthur.\nArthur: Is the, is the blonde girl really your, your girlfriend?\nLeonard: Yes, sir.\nArthur: You\u2019re the genius.\n(Back in the Apartment)\nPenny: So, do you do a lot of appearances like this?\nArthur: It, it\u2019s hard to say. I\u2019m, I\u2019m still trying to figure out what, what th, what this is.\nLeonard: We just wanted to hang out with you and maybe learn a little about your life.\nArthur: Well, there, there really isn\u2019t too much to tell. After the TV show was, was cancelled, nobody in the scientific world would, uh, would take me seriously. So I was forced to do these, uh, children\u2019s parties to, to make a living.\nLeonard: That\u2019s too bad. But still, working with kids, it must be rewarding.\nArthur: You, you get bit a lot. Let me see if, if I have this straight. You, you two are, are physicists, and you, and you want me to do a children\u2019s science show?\nSheldon: Yes. And if there\u2019s time, take 12 pictures with us in seasonal clothing.\nArthur: You know, I\u2019m a real scientist. I, I have a PhD from Cornell University.\nSheldon: Yeah, that\u2019s great. Did you bring your puppet?\nArthur: No, no. I, I hate that puppet.\nSheldon: Oh, no. How could anybody hate Gino the Neutrino? It\u2019s nice, huh? I got him for 20 bucks on eBay. Including the shipping!\nArthur: I\u2019m, I\u2019m awake, right? Th, this is happening?\nScene: Bernadette\u2019s car.\nBernadette: Cinnamon!\nHoward: Cinnamon!\nBernadette: You know, maybe she doesn\u2019t recognize her name because of Raj\u2019s accent.\nHoward: Good thinking. (In a bad Indian accent) Cinnamon, come to Daddy.\nBernadette (likewise): Cinnamon. Where are you, my little lamb chop?\nHoward: Nice.\nBernadette: Thanks.\nHoward: When this all blows over, remember that voice. It\u2019s kind of a turn-on.\nBernadette: It turns you on when I sound like Raj?\nHoward: Cinnamon!\nScene: The apartment. \nArthur: Okay, as, as I put the egg on top, and, and the flame goes out and, and, and the air pressure decreases in, in the flask, what do you think will happen?\nPenny: I think I know.\nSheldon: It\u2019s gonna get sucked in. It\u2019s going to get sucked in.\nPenny: Okay, I didn\u2019t know.\nSheldon: Yes.\nPenny: See, I\u2019m not a scientist like them.\nArthur: I, I figured that out.\nSheldon: Potato clock. Do potato clock.\nPenny: What\u2019s that?\nArthur: I, I power a clock with a, with a potato.\nPenny: Shut up. You can do that? I mean, wouldn\u2019t that solve the world\u2019s energy crisis?\nArthur: No. Look, guys, keep your money. I, I think, uh, I, I think I\u2019m done.\nSheldon: What, well what\u2019s wrong? Is she upsetting you? Because I can make her go away.\nArthur: No, she, she\u2019s the only reason I\u2019ve, I\u2019ve stayed this long.\nLeonard: Then what is it?\nArthur: I don\u2019t know. I think I\u2019m just, I, I just, I just don\u2019t want to be Professor Proton any more.\nSheldon: Well, how can you say that? Professor Proton\u2019s the best.\nArthur: What, what has it ever gotten me? I mean, I\u2019m, I\u2019m an 83-year-old man who has potatoes in, in his suitcase. Other scientists think, think I\u2019m a joke. And the, the puppeteer who did, who did Gino, well, he also did my wife.\nSheldon: Mr. Jeffries, I need to show you something. :14:11,446\nPenny: I\u2019m sorry to hear about your troubles.\nArthur: Uh, thanks.\nPenny: But if you don\u2019t mind me asking, uh, the potato clock, how does it work? Is it a trick clock or a trick potato?\nArthur: What do you two talk about?\nSheldon: I wrote a fan letter to you when I was a child in Texas, and you sent this autographed picture back to me. Do you remember that?\nArthur: I\u2019ll, I\u2019ll give you a hint. I have a bracelet with my own address on it.\nSheldon: Well, anyway, um, you may find this hard to believe, but I didn\u2019t have any friends growing up.\nArthur: No, I, I get that.\nSheldon: But, um, I did have you. And every day at four o\u2019clock, you\u2019d come to my house on Channel 68, and we\u2019d do science together. If it hadn\u2019t been for you, well, who knows what would\u2019ve become of me? You know? Instead of a world-class physicist, I could\u2019ve wound up as a hobo. Or a surgeon.\nLeonard: I bet there are important discoveries being made every day because you inspired millions of kids to pursue science. In a way, their discoveries are your discoveries.\nSheldon: Yeah, it\u2019s true. A generation of young scientists are standing on your shoulders.\nArthur: Well, thank, thank you, guys. That, that, that means a lot.\nLeonard: It\u2019s important you know how much you mean to us.\nArthur: Uh-oh.\nPenny: Arthur, are you okay?\nArthur: I\u2019m having a problem with my pacemaker.\nLeonard: I\u2019ll, I\u2019ll call for help.\nPenny: Any chance we could plug it into the potato?\nArthur: No.\nScene: The telescope lab. Raj\u2019s phone rings.\nRaj: Hello? What do you mean, you found my dog? She\u2019s with my friends. Is she okay? Oh, thank you. Uh, just text me your address, I\u2019m on my way. Oh, and if she\u2019s hungry, go ahead and feed her. But do not give her anything starchy. She\u2019s having risotto for dinner.\nScene: The apartment.\nParamedic: Your vitals are stable, but let\u2019s take you in for some tests just to be safe.\nLeonard: You want one of us to go with you in the ambulance?\nSheldon: I\u2019ll do it.\nArthur: He\u2019s not a relative, he\u2019s not allowed, right?\nParamedic: No, that\u2019s not a rule. He can go.\nSheldon: Oh, yeah.\nArthur: I can\u2019t catch a break today.\nPenny: We\u2019ll pack up your stuff and meet you at the hospital.\nLeonard: I\u2019m sorry things turned out this way.\nArthur: Well, at, at this point, I\u2019m just glad someone\u2019s carrying me down the stairs.\nSheldon: Met my childhood hero, now I get to ride in an ambulance. Boy, if we can get him to do that calendar, this\u2019ll be the best day ever.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s apartment.\nBernadette: Can\u2019t believe we lost her. What was I thinking? I\u2019d be a terrible mom.\nHoward: Well, maybe with the first one. But kids are like pancakes. The first one\u2019s always a throwaway. How\u2019s this look?\nBernadette: It\u2019s fine. Where\u2019d you get that picture of her?\nHoward: It\u2019s not her. I just googled foo-foo little dogs. (Skype tone) It\u2019s Raj. Stay quiet. Hey, bad timing. Bernadette just took Cinnamon out for a walk.\nRaj: Hmm. Interesting. Did they take a walk down Liars\u2019 Lane?\nHoward: What?\nRaj: A lane frequented by liars. Like you, you big liar.\nHoward: You have her?\nBernadette: Oh, thank God she\u2019s okay.\nRaj: Well, I trusted you, and you let me down. The poor thing\u2019s been shaking for hours.\nHoward: I\u2019m really sorry.\nBernadette: Hang on, you\u2019ve had her for hours?\nRaj: Yes. I picked her up, and then we both went for massages to try and calm down. And then we got Pinkberry.\nBernadette: So you knew she was okay, and you couldn\u2019t pick up the phone to tell us?\nRaj: Well, I, I thought about\u2026\nBernadette: Don\u2019t well me, mister. We\u2019ve been worried sick. She could have been dead for all we knew. You should be ashamed of yourself.\nRaj: Sorry. I, I just\u2026\nBernadette: Sorry\u2019s not good enough. Maybe you need to take some time and think about what you\u2019ve done.\nHoward: Nice guilt trip. You are gonna be an amazing mom.\nScene: A hospital room.\nSheldon: Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur. Happy kitty, sleepy kitty, purr, purr, purr.\nArthur: Thank you, Sheldon. That, that was very nice.\nSheldon: Want me to sing it again?\nArthur: No. The fourth, the fourth time was, was the charm.\nSheldon: There anything I can get for you? Some apple juice? Uh, some Jell-O?\nArthur: No. No, thank you. But I, I do, I do have a favour to, to ask.\nSheldon: Name it.\nArthur: Well, I\u2019m, I\u2019m booked to do a children\u2019s party tomorrow, and, um, frankly I, you know, I, I don\u2019t feel up to it.\nSheldon: Oh, you\u2019re not. You look awful.\nArthur: Thank you. Anyway, uh, I mean, you know my act better than anybody. I was, I was hoping that maybe, you know, maybe you\u2019d fill in for me.\nSheldon: Are you saying that you want me to be Professor Proton?\nArthur: Yeah.\nSheldon: Oh, my. What an honour. Oh, this is like being asked to ascend Mount Olympus and dine with the gods.\nArthur: Or a Korean family in Alhambra.\nSheldon: But they\u2019ll know I\u2019m not you. Should I call myself Professor Proton, Jr.?\nArthur: Sounds great.\nSheldon: So, in a way it\u2019s like I\u2019m your son.\nArthur: What, Whatever.\nSheldon: Father.\nArthur: Sure, what the hell.\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "5_23": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: Howard\u2019s laboratory. The phone rings. Howard puts it on speaker.\nHoward: Howard Wolowitz.\nVoice: Hey, Howard. Dave Roeger here at NASA. We need to talk about your upcoming mission.\nHoward: Yes, yes, I\u2019ve been doing my push-ups. I\u2019m still stuck at nine, but that\u2019s going all the way down with no one holding me.\nRoeger: That\u2019s great, uh, but that\u2019s not why I called. We\u2019ve run into a bit of a snafu. Your Soyuz capsule failed the pressurization test, so bottom line, mission\u2019s been scrubbed.\nHoward (Picks up receiver): You\u2019re kidding. So what does that mean? Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Boy, I got to tell you, I\u2019m really disappointed. This was my dream ever since I was a little kid. Okay, well, uh, thanks for the call. Yep, you, too. (Puts down phone.) Yes! Thank you! Oh! Oh! I\u2019m not gonna die in space! I\u2019m gonna die the way God intended, in my late 50s, with a heart full of pastrami.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: A suit shop.\nSheldon (off): I\u2019m going to need a larger shirt. This one\u2019s a little tight under the arms.\nAssistant: Okay.\nLeonard: Do you think maybe it\u2019s tight because you\u2019re wearing long underwear?\nSheldon: Yes, of course that\u2019s why it\u2019s tight.\nLeonard: All right, let me rephrase the question. Why are you wearing long underwear?\nSheldon: You\u2019re kidding. Shouldn\u2019t the question be why aren\u2019t you?\nLeonard: No, it should be: why are you?\nSheldon: Leonard, these rental tuxedos have been worn by hundreds of sweaty strangers. I don\u2019t like my own sweat touching my skin, how do you think I feel about theirs?\nAssistant: Why don\u2019t you slip this on?\nSheldon: Said the hangman offering a noose.\nRaj: Well, that wasn\u2019t as entertaining as when he rents bowling shoes, but it was right up there.\nHoward: Well, that\u2019s it. My orders have been rescinded. I am officially no go to space.\nLeonard: I\u2019m sorry, Howard, but I got to tell you, I\u2019m a little relieved you\u2019re not going.\nHoward: Why?\nLeonard: Come on, you were gonna go up in a rocket designed in the 1960s by the Russians.\nHoward: Yeah, so?\nLeonard: When was the last time you were at Best Buy and you heard someone say, ooh, check out this Blu-ray player, it must be good, it was built in Russia\u201d?\nHoward: Well, their technology isn\u2019t that bad.\nRaj: When you come back to Earth in a Soyuz capsule, you free-fall from space at 500 miles per hour, and the only thing that slows you down is a little parachute that pops out right before you crash into the ground. And the whole thing was designed by the same brilliant minds who were unable to capture Rocky and Bullwinkle.\nHoward: All right, well, whatever. I wasn\u2019t worried.\nRaj: You weren\u2019t?\nHoward: Let me explain the difference between you and me. You watch Star Trek. I live it.\nRaj: Oh, please. I don\u2019t remember the episode of Star Trek where the guy never goes to space and brags about it in a tuxedo store.\nHoward: Make all the jokes you want, but there\u2019s only one of us here brave enough to almost do what I almost did.\nSheldon: Ah, much better.\nLeonard: You must be burning up.\nSheldon: A little. But not more than your urethras will be after whatever\u2019s in those pants swims up them. Well, I cut quite the dashing, yet hygienic figure, don\u2019t I? I look like the Flash about to get married. Oh! A tissue! A tissue! Oh, good Lord!\nAssistant: Uh, where\u2019s he going?\nLeonard: He keeps emergency Purell in the car.\nSheldon: Keys! Keys! Keys!\nScene: Penny\u2019s door.\nPenny: Hey, you.\nLeonard: Before I come in, you should know, I have gas. (Holds up gas canister) \nPenny: For the record, not your worst opening line.\nLeonard: Check it out. It\u2019s the gas I use in my free-electron laser to support high voltages. But it also has an interesting secondary use. Here. Breathe this in.\nPenny: B-Before I do it, if you\u2019re a cop you have tell me, right?\nLeonard: Just try it.\nPenny: Okay. (In weirdly low voice) What\u2019s it supposed to\u2026 Oh, my God, this is so freaky!\nLeonard (in low voice): You\u2019re a mean one Mr. Grinch.\nPenny: Okay. Me, me, me. Ready? (Low voice) Leonard, I am your father.\nLeonard: I have never been more attracted to a woman who sounds like a man in my life.\nPenny: Oh, Mm. Hey, you know how we\u2019ve been taking things slow?\nLeonard: Mm-hmm.\nPenny: Well, I\u2019ve been thinking, and maybe I\u2019m ready to take things a little faster.\nLeonard: Oh, great.\nPenny: Mm-hmm.\nLeonard: And I promise, after waiting four months, fast is what you\u2019re gonna get.\nPenny: You know, just-just one thing. Look, we\u2019re in a really great place right now, and I don\u2019t want to do anything that will make stuff all weird again.\nLeonard: So we won\u2019t let it get weird.\nPenny: Okay. Oh, and just a heads-up, mm, since the last time you saw me naked, I got a Cookie Monster tattoo. The acceptable responses when you see it are awesome or nothing.\nLeonard: What about (inhales gas, in low voice) Cookies!\nScene: Amy\u2019s apartment.\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Amy? (Knock, knock, knock) Amy? (Knock, knock, knock) Amy?\nAmy: Seven o\u2019clock, right on time.\nSheldon: It\u2019s not an accident. I waited outside your door for twenty minutes.\nAmy: Well, dinner\u2019s almost ready.\nSheldon: I must say, I was surprised you chose to spend our date night in your apartment. As I mentioned, the Pasadena City Council is debating longer crosswalk times, and later, the LEGO store is having a midnight madness sale. You ask anyone, that\u2019s a hot date.\nAmy: Tempting choices, but I have something special planned for tonight.\nSheldon: What can be more special than having an adequate amount of time to cross the street on your way to buy a tiny LEGO Indiana Jones?\nAmy: With our friends moving forward in their relationships, I\u2019ve decided that we should make progress in ours as well.\nSheldon: Oh, dear Lord. Two years ago, we didn\u2019t even know each other, and now I\u2019m in your apartment after dark. How much faster can this thing go?\nAmy: I had a feeling you\u2019d be reluctant, which is why I\u2019m going to dip into my neurobiological bag of tricks.\nSheldon: Oh, you brain monkeys kill me. Dip away.\nAmy: I have devised an experiment that I believe will increase your feelings for me in an accelerated time frame.\nSheldon: And how do you propose to do that? Uh, hope you\u2019re not thinking about some sort of LSD thought control. Because there\u2019s only one mind-expanding drug that this man enjoys, and that\u2019s called school.\nAmy: Human beings form emotional attachments as they grow up. In your case, to your mother, superheroes, et cetera. I\u2019m going to attempt an experiment that will get you to transfer those feelings to me.\nSheldon: Well, seems what\u2019s on the menu tonight is malarkey with a big side of poppycock.\nAmy: We\u2019ll see. Let\u2019s start with a little romantic dinner music, shall we?\nSheldon: Super Mario Bros. theme?\nAmy: Yes.\nSheldon: I see what you\u2019re doing. You\u2019re attempting to build on the work of Ebbinghaus by triggering an involuntary memory of me playing that game, admittedly the happiest 600 hours of my childhood, but it won\u2019t work.\nAmy: Fine. There\u2019s no reason we still can\u2019t have a lovely dinner. Why don\u2019t you have a seat.\nSheldon: Da-da-da da-da dum, boink, boink.\nAmy: May I offer you something to drink?\nSheldon: You know I don\u2019t drink.\nAmy: Not even strawberry Quik?\nSheldon: I love strawberry Quik. It\u2019s my favourite pink fluid, narrowly beating out Pepto-Bismol.\nAmy: Oh, I know. I think it will go nicely with what I have prepared for dinner.\nSheldon: Spaghetti with little pieces of hot dog cut up in it!\nAmy: Just like your mommy used to make.\nSheldon: Oh yummy, yummy! We should do this more often. Uh-oh.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment.\nLeonard: I\u2019m sorry. I did, I crossed a line. I didn\u2019t mean to!\nPenny: Who says something like that right in the middle of sex?\nLeonard: I don\u2019t know, it just came out. People say weird things during sex all the time.\nPenny: Okay, well, they sure as hell don\u2019t say that.\nLeonard: It was the heat of the moment.\nPenny: No, the heat of the moment is, ooh, yeah, just like that, not will you marry me?\nLeonard: I\u2019m sorry. Just, just give me another chance.\nPenny: Why, so you can crawl under the covers and go, hey, baby, want to go look for houses in neighbourhoods with good schools?\nLeonard: Again, I\u2019m sorry. You know, with Howard and Bernadette getting married, I got caught up in a little wedding fever. I take it back.\nPenny: You can\u2019t take something like that back. I mean, what are we even supposed to do now?\nLeonard: Okay, at some point, we\u2019ll look back and this is going to be a funny story. Why don\u2019t we just start doing that now?\nPenny: You\u2019re kidding.\nLeonard: No. Hey, do you remember that time when I proposed to you in bed? And you were all, like, what are you doing? That was so funny. So funny.\nPenny: It\u2019s not funny.\nLeonard: Give it a minute. Is that a little smile I see there? I should go.\nScene: Howard\u2019s bedroom.\nHoward: Hey, I was thinking. For our first dance at the wedding, what if we learn the final number from Dirty Dancing?\nBernadette: You\u2019re kidding.\nHoward: No, come on. How cool would that be? Me running into your arms, you lifting me up into the air.\nBernadette: Oh, you\u2019re in a good mood.\nHoward: Yeah, well, why wouldn\u2019t I be? You know, I\u2019m marrying the girl of my dreams, and I finally got my mother to agree not to come on our honeymoon. (Phone rings) Oh, hang on. Oh, it\u2019s NASA. Wolowitz. Oh! Hi, Dave. What\u2019s up? No kidding. Really? Well, that\u2019s great news. Great, great news. All right, I\u2019ll watch my e-mail for the details. Okay, talk soon.\nBernadette: What\u2019s so great?\nHoward: It looks like I\u2019m going into space after all.\nBernadette: Oh, Howie, that\u2019s wonderful!\nHoward: Uh-huh, wonderful. Yay.\nBernadette: What happened? I thought they cancelled your mission.\nHoward: Th-They did. But NASA really wants my telescope up on the space station, so they\u2019re putting me on an earlier launch.\nBernadette: When?\nHoward: A week from Friday.\nBernadette: What? We\u2019re getting married that Sunday.\nHoward: You\u2019re right. I, I can\u2019t go to space. I have to get married, and no one can say that\u2019s not a good reason. I\u2019ll call him back.\nBernadette: Wait. I don\u2019t want to be the one who stands in your way.\nHoward: Well, too bad, you already did. It\u2019s a done deal. Oh, well. But I forgive you.\nBernadette: No. That\u2019s not how I want to start our marriage, killing your dream. We\u2019ll have the wedding when you get back.\nHoward: But what about all the plans and the guests?\nBernadette: We\u2019ll call them. Although my dad\u2019s gonna go a little nutso over losing his deposits.\nHoward: You\u2019re right, he is! Your dad\u2019s gonna be furious. There\u2019s no way he\u2019s gonna let us postpone this wedding. Well, we tried.\nBernadette: I\u2019ll talk to him. He won\u2019t say no to his little girl.\nHoward: No. I, uh, I should talk to him, man to man.\nBernadette: But, Howie, my dad can be a bully. He\u2019s gonna make you cancel your space flight.\nHoward: We can only hope\u2026 that he doesn\u2019t.\nScene: The apartment. Sheldon and Leonard are playing three dimensional chess.\nSheldon: Bishop to queen four, level two. Check.\nLeonard: Sheldon, knight takes bishop. You all right?\nSheldon: I\u2019m fine.\nLeonard: Are you? You left your queen exposed from above, you trapped your knight in the corner, and you keep sighing and saying, why me?\nSheldon: Very well. Can I ask you a question about women?\nLeonard: We got you that book last year. Wasn\u2019t everything in there?\nSheldon: No, I\u2019m having a relationship problem with Amy. And by the way, that book gave me nightmares.\nLeonard: Well, if it makes you feel any better, I screwed things up pretty good with Penny.\nSheldon: Look at us, Leonard, engaging in the social convention of men bellyaching about their ol\u2019 ladies.\nLeonard: I guess we are. So, what\u2019s going on?\nSheldon: Believe it or not, Amy has embarked on a campaign to increase my feelings for her by making me happy.\nLeonard: I\u2019m sorry, that must be very difficult for you.\nSheldon: It\u2019s awful. This morning, she arranged for me to be an Amtrak junior conductor for the day. It, it\u2019s usually only open to children. She got them to make an exception.\nLeonard: Shame on her.\nSheldon: They let me blow the whistle, Leonard.\nLeonard: She\u2019s good.\nSheldon: I know. And it gets worse. Her efforts are causing me to have affectionate feelings for her at inappropriate times.\nLeonard: You mean, like in bed or in the shower?\nSheldon: No! Would you please stop referencing that infernal book? For example, this morning, I was calculating the random motion of virtual particles in a vacuum, when suddenly the particles morphed into an image of Amy\u2019s dandruff gently cascading down onto her pale, slightly hunched shoulders. Oh, what has that vixen done to me, Leonard? And how do I make it stop?\nLeonard: Well, if you had a physical relationship, I\u2019d say propose during sex. Turns out that\u2019s a real mood killer.\nSheldon: I assume we\u2019re talking about you now?\nLeonard: Yeah.\nSheldon: So, that\u2019s how this works? I complain, and then you complain, and no one offers any solutions?\nLeonard: Pretty much.\nSheldon: Well, no wonder the women are winning.\nScene: Bernadette\u2019s father\u2019s house.\nHoward: Mr. Rostenkowski, are you busy?\nMr. Rostenkowski: I\u2019m just looking at some old pictures. Come on in.\nHoward: Family pictures, or\u2026 holy crap, that\u2019s a dead person.\nMr. Rostenkowski: Last murder case before I retired. How many bodies do you see there? Careful, it\u2019s a trick question.\nHoward: I\u2019m not sure.\nMr. Rostenkowski: Nah, you\u2019ll never get it. It\u2019s a fraction.\nHoward: How about that. Anyway, sir, I need to talk to you about something.\nMr. Rostenkowski: Walnut?\nHoward: No, thank you. I\u2019m allergic.\nMr. Rostenkowski: Oh, sure. My partner used to have that. He\u2019s dead now.\nHoward: From nuts?\nMr. Rostenkowski: Nah, his wife shot him. But she was nuts, so in a way.\nHoward: Nice story. Anyway, the reason I wanted to talk to you is NASA has moved up my launch to the International Space Station.\nMr. Rostenkowski: Yeah, so?\nHoward: So, the date is going to conflict with me marrying your daughter. Now, I know what you\u2019re going to say, I made a commitment to Bernadette and to your family and I\u2019ve got a hell of a lot of nerve coming in here and demanding that we postpone this thing. Well, message heard and understood. Mission cancelled. Thank you.\nMr. Rostenkowski: Where are you going?\nHoward: I\u2019m sorry. May I be excused?\nMr. Rostenkowski: No, you may not. Let me tell you something. When I first met you\u2026 You just gonna stand there?\nHoward: I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t know, is this going to\u2026 Well, I should sit\u2026 May I be seat\u2026 Well, I\u2019ll just sit.\nMr. Rostenkowski: When I first met you, I didn\u2019t like you.\nHoward: I\u2019m aware of that, sir.\nMr. Rostenkowski: But then you and I had some time together.\nHoward: Uh-huh.\nMr. Rostenkowski: It did not get better.\nHoward: Right, right.\nMr. Rostenkowski: That silly Beatle haircut and you riding around on a red Vespa, and you still living at home with your mother. To be honest, I thought Bernadette chose you to punish me. But then I heard about your astronaut thing, and I realized I judged you too fast. Maybe you are the right guy for my little girl.\nHoward: Oh, I am. And just so you know, I\u2019d still be an astronaut, even if I didn\u2019t go to space. I\u2019ve got an I.D. Card and a NASA golf shirt.\nMr. Rostenkowski: No, no, you got to go. You can\u2019t turn down an opportunity like this.\nHoward: But what about the wedding and all the money you put down for the reception?\nMr. Rostenkowski: You let me worry about that. You go up to that space station, and you make me proud.\nHoward: Um, okay.\nMr. Rostenkowski: You got a problem with that?\nHoward: All right, look, I\u2019m gonna level with you. I\u2019m terrified about going into space. What if I don\u2019t make it back?\nMr. Rostenkowski: It\u2019s gonna be okay, son.\nHoward: You really think so?\nMr. Rostenkowski: Of course. A pretty girl like Bernadette, she\u2019ll find a new guy.\nScene: The stairwell.\nPenny: Hey.\nLeonard: Hey. Off to work?\nPenny: Yeah.\nLeonard: Have a nice night.\nPenny: Okay, you, too.\nLeonard: Penny, just, wait. I\u2019ve been thinking about what I said when we were in bed the other night.\nPenny: Yeah, I\u2019ve been thinking about it, too.\nLeonard: I noticed you never answered me.\nPenny: You\u2019re right. (Kisses him) No.\nLeonard: Uh, follow-up. Are we still dating?\nPenny: Yep.\nLeonard: Is it still weird \u2019cause I proposed?\nPenny: Yep.\nLeonard: I have a couple more quick questions. Do you want to call me from the car?\nPenny: No!\nLeonard: I played that pretty well. (Enters apartment. Amy, dressed as a Vulcan starfleet officer, is examining Sheldon.)\nAmy: Hello, Leonard.\nLeonard: What are you doing?\nAmy: We\u2019re playing doctor. Star Trek style.\nSheldon: I\u2019m in hell, Leonard.

Great. Hey, can I ask you something?\nPriya: Sure.\nLeonard: Last night, me wanting to try that stuff out of the Kama Sutra, was that fun for you or kinda racially insensitive?\nPriya: Yeah, just because you\u2019re in bed with an Indian woman, you think that gives you permission to use crazy positions from an ancient Indian love manual?\nLeonard: Hey, if you can find a book called weird sex with white boys, I\u2019d be okay with that.\nPriya: No, you have such beautiful eyes. Have you ever thought about getting contacts?\nLeonard: I tried in the seventh grade. I could never get used to them.\nPriya: Oh, that\u2019s too bad.\nLeonard: Yeah, if I had contacts I would have been the coolest debate club president ever to be stuffed into his own cello case.\nPriya: If you had them on now, you could see what we\u2019re going to do next.\nLeonard: Th-th-th-that\u2019s okay. I can infer from context.\nScene: The cafeteria.\nHoward: Hey, Raj, wanna see a new magic trick I\u2019ve been working on?\nSheldon: Howard, if I may interject here with a piece of friendly advice. Is working on magic tricks really how you want to spend your time? Granted, you\u2019re just an engineer, but that doesn\u2019t mean you might not someday build a geegaw or a thingamabob that may get you a thank you in someone else\u2019s Nobel prize acceptance speech.\nRaj: Is the trick making him disappear? Sure, let\u2019s see it.\nHoward: Here, shuffle these.\nRaj: Okay.\nHoward: Now spread them out on the table face down. Pick one, look at it.\nRaj: Okay.\nHoward: Now remember your card, put it back in the deck.\nSheldon: Is it any wonder he doesn\u2019t have a doctorate?\nHoward: Remind me, what\u2019s your birthday?\nRaj: October sixth.\nHoward: Okay, October is the tenth month. So ten, one plus zero is one, plus six is seven. Turn over the seventh card.\nRaj: How about that!\nHoward: Is that your card?\nRaj: Yes, it is. Very cool!\nSheldon: It\u2019s not cool. It\u2019s a childish trick designed to confuse and intrigue simpletons. How\u2019d you do it?\nHoward: A magician never reveals his secrets. But surely a future Nobel prize winner can figure it out.\nSheldon: Fine. Give me a second.\nHoward: You ever notice when he thinks real hard, it smells like bacon?\n(Leonard enters, bumps into random man)\n \nRandom man: Oh, hey!\nLeonard: Sorry! Oop!\n(Continues across room bumping into nearly everyone in the room and knocking many things over)\nLeonard: Sorry! Pardon me! Oh, I\u2019m so sorry! My fault! Check it out.

That is amazing!\nSheldon: It\u2019s not amazing. All magic tricks are merely a combination of manipulation and misdirection with the occasional dwarf in a box wiggling his feet.\nHoward: Oh, really? So how did I do it?\nSheldon: Well, I don\u2019t care how you did it. I have more important things to think about. Clearly, the cards are marked.\nHoward: I thought you had more important things to think about.\nSheldon: I do. You just happen to have caught me on a break. Oh, let me see those cards.\nPenny: Oh, big deal. Not knowing is part of the fun.\nSheldon: Not knowing is part of the fun. Was that the motto of your community college?\nLeonard: Hey, guys, what do you think? Priya took me clothes shopping.\nPenny: Hey, you look great. Good for you, Priya. I could never get that stupid hoodie off him when we were\u2026 well, you look great.\nLeonard: Thank you.\nPriya: Lets go hang everything up.\nLeonard: Yeah, good. New contacts. I should have done this years ago.\nHoward: So you finally getting used to them doing it on a daily basis?\nPenny: I\u2019m not going out with him.

Get another deck and I\u2019ll do the trick with that.\nSheldon: So you\u2019re saying this is a regulation deck?\nHoward: I\u2019m saying believe in magic, you muggle.\nPenny: You know, well, I\u2019m happy Leonard\u2019s found someone. Not that anybody asked.\nScene: Leonard\u2019s bedroom\nPriya: How many Star Trek uniforms do you have?\nLeonard: Just two. Everyday and dress.\nPriya: Uh-huh. Listen, we need to talk about something.\nLeonard: Oh, my god, you\u2019re breaking up with me! Why would you take me out shopping and then break up with me? That is so cruel.\nPriya: Leonard, I\u2019m not breaking up with you.\nLeonard: Oh, okay. So, what\u2019s up?\nPriya: It\u2019s a little weird, your ex-girlfriend hanging out here all the time.\nLeonard: I know. I usually never see my ex-girlfriends, unless their hard drives crash.\nPriya: I\u2019m just saying, how would you feel if I was hanging out with my ex-boyfriend?\nLeonard: Um, not great, I guess. But Penny and I are just friends.\nPriya: I don\u2019t care. This is a woman you have slept with. If you want her around, then I have to wonder if maybe you\u2019re not ready to move on.\nLeonard: No, no-no-no, I\u2019m ready! I gave up the gift of sight for you. If that\u2019s not moving on, what is?\nPriya: You need to cut the cord with Penny.\nLeonard: Oh. Okay.\nPriya: You don\u2019t sound very confident.\nLeonard: No, no, I\u2019m confident. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m unfamiliar with the get lost conversation. Although, this will be the first time I\u2019ll be the one saying it.\nPriya: Thank you. I appreciate it.\nLeonard: Sure. Oh, god, you smell so good. Of course, that could just be my other senses getting stronger. Hypothetically, if I had access To a Lieutenant Uhura uniform, would you wear it?\nPriya: Leonard, it is a source of great pain to me and my family that my brother has that outfit in his wardrobe.

What happened with the contacts?\nLeonard: One of them\u2019s upstairs. The other one sort of slipped back into my skull.\nPenny: Hey, is that one of the new shirts Priya got you?\nLeonard: Yeah.\nPenny: You don\u2019t wanna wash that.\nLeonard: No?\nPenny: No, that\u2019s silk. Seriously, what would you do without me?\nLeonard: Yeah.\nPenny: You know, I gotta tell you, I think you got a real winner with Priya.\nLeonard: Yeah, me, too.\nPenny: She seems really sweet. Believe me, you do not want to take that for granted. There are a lot of bitches out there.\nLeonard: Yeah, bitches are the worst.\nPenny: All right, well I\u2019ll see you later.\nLeonard: Uh, Penny, there\u2019s something I have to tell you.\nPenny: What?\nLeonard: Okay, uh, how do I put this? Um, are you familiar with Darwin\u2019s observation of the finches in the Galapagos Islands?\nPenny: Did they make a movie about it?\nLeonard: No.\nPenny: Then no.\nLeonard: All right, well, anyway, Darwin observed that when two groups of finches competed over the same food source, eventually one of them would evolve a different beak shape so they could feed on something else.\nPenny: Okay.\nLeonard: So what do you think we can learn from that behaviour that we can apply to our own lives?\nPenny: Uh, a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush?\nLeonard: Sure, that has birds in it.\nPenny: It\u2019s fun talking to you, Leonard, I always learn stuff.\nLeonard: I\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019m gonna count that.\nScene: Leonard\u2019s bedroom\nPriya: Do you really have to wear that in bed?\nLeonard: Yeah. The doctor didn\u2019t want me to rub my eye during the night. It was either this or one of those giant neck cones.\nPriya: So did you get to talk to Penny?\nLeonard: Oh, yes. Indeed, I did.\nPriya: And?\nLeonard: She completely understood everything I said. Case closed.\nPriya: Was she upset?\nLeonard: Maybe, but that\u2019s not my problem. She\u2019s not my girlfriend, you are.\nPriya: I hope you weren\u2019t cruel to her.\nLeonard: Is the autumn cruel for letting the flowers die, or is that just nature\u2019s way?\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard? (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard? (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard?\nLeonard: What?\nSheldon: I think I figured out Wolowitz\u2019s magic trick, and I need you to pick a card.\nLeonard: I am not opening that door, Sheldon.\nSheldon: As you wish. (Cards slide under door) Pick a card, put it back, and prepare to be amazed. (Leonard does not) Did you pick one?\nLeonard: Yep.\nSheldon: (Sliding card under door) Is this your card?\nLeonard: (Not looking) Nope.\nSheldon: Drat. Is this your card?\nLeonard: No.\nSheldon: I\u2019ll be right back.\nScene: The apartment. Sheldon is alone.\nSheldon: Pick a card, Sheldon. Now look at it, and put it back in the deck. Now do you remember your card? Of course I do, I have an eidetic memory. My apologies. Now shuffle the cards. Shuffling. Wait here. Processing image, cross-referencing.\nLeonard: Whatcha doin\u2019?\nSheldon: I\u2019m reverse engineering Wolowitz\u2019s magic trick.\nLeonard: What\u2019s up with the infrared cameras?\nSheldon: I\u2019m measuring residual heat levels on the playing cards to determine which one\u2019s been touched. By the way, if you hope to have children, I suggest you switch from briefs to boxers. Your testicles look a tad warm.\nLeonard: Holy crap, are you connected to the Oak Ridge National Laboratory?\nSheldon: Yes. I\u2019m using their Cray Supercomputer to analyze shuffling patterns.\nLeonard: Sheldon, that computer is used for National defence. Hacking into it is a Federal crime.\nSheldon: Relax, we\u2019re not under attack right now.\nLeonard: Okay, I\u2019m leaving before the black helicopters get here.\nSheldon: And is this my card? Rats! I wonder if Howard used a radioactive tracer. Where am I going to find Uranium-235 this time of night? Come on, Craigslist.\nScene: A restaurant\nLeonard: Is it racist that I took you to an Indian restaurant?\nPriya: It\u2019s okay, I like Indian food.\nLeonard: Or as you probably call it back home, food.\nPriya: Why didn\u2019t you wear your contacts? Don\u2019t you like them?\nLeonard: No, no, I do. It\u2019s just I knew I was having curry tonight and I only want one part of my body to burn at a time.\nPriya: You know, my company offered me a position here in Los Angeles.\nLeonard: Does that mean you\u2019d relocate here permanently?\nPriya: Maybe. What do you think?\nLeonard:Oh, \u00a0I love it. Oh, that\u2019s great!\nPenny (knocking on window): Hi! Hi! Just hang on.\nLeonard: Small world.\nPriya: You did talk to her, didn\u2019t you?\nLeonard: Of course, I did. I talked and talked and talked.\nPenny: Hey! Look at Leonard in his fancy-ass grownup clothes. Way to go, Priya. For once, he doesn\u2019t look like a mannequin in the boys\u2019 department. Hey, did he tell you I saved the silk shirt?\nPriya: No, he did not.\nPenny: He was gonna throw it in the washing machine with his Spiderman underwear. That\u2019s our Lenny, huh?\nPriya: Yes, that\u2019s our Lenny.\nPenny: So, how\u2019s the food here? Oh, wow, that is really, really good. Oh, I\u2019m sorry. You guys are on a date. We can hang out anytime. Have fun.\nLeonard: Bye.\nPriya: Good night.\nPenny: Oh, that\u2019s, hot, hot, hot, hot! Whoo! It really sneaks up on ya, huh? All right, I gotta go.\nLeonard: It is pretty spicy.\nScene: The cafeteria.\nSheldon: Oh, I\u2019ve been meaning to tell you, I figured out your magic trick.\nHoward: Really?\nSheldon: Oh, yes. In fact, I improved upon it.\nHoward: I\u2019d love to see that. How about you, Raj?\nRaj: Beefaroni and a show? How do you turn that down?\nSheldon: All right. Pick a card.\nHoward: Okay.\nSheldon: Bippity-boppity-boo.\nHoward: What\u2019s with the wand and the beep?\nSheldon: The wand is called showmanship, and the beep is none of your business. Oh! Excuse me, I\u2019m getting a text message completely unrelated to this magic trick. Oh, look, my dry cleaning\u2019s ready. And your card was the five of spades. Ta-da.\nRaj: These cards have barcodes on them. The wand is a reader. It\u2019s transmitting to your phone.\nSheldon: I said, ta-da. Show\u2019s over.\nHoward: That\u2019s pathetic. Let me show you how a real magician does it. Raj, take a card. Don\u2019t let me see it.\nRaj: Okay.\nHoward: Three of clubs. (It isn\u2019t)\nRaj: Son of a gun, you\u2019re blowing my mind!\nHoward: Bippity-boppity-boo-yah!\nSheldon: That does it. I\u2019m getting uranium.\nRaj: You ever gonna tell him?\nHoward: Maybe. When it stops being fun.\nRaj: So never.\nScene: Penny\u2019s door.\nPenny: Oh, hey, I was just on my way to work.\nLeonard: Oh, okay, it\u2019s not important. It can wait.\nPenny: No, it\u2019s all right. Walk me down. So, what\u2019s up?\nLeonard: Uh, I kind of have a problem I was hoping you could help me with.\nPenny: Sure, anything.\nLeonard: Move out.\nPenny: What?\nLeonard: Well, uh, not far. Hey, if you ever wanna start a family, La Ca\u00f1ada has some great schools.\nPenny: Okay, I\u2019m not moving anywhere. What the hell is this all about?\nLeonard: Why does it have to be about anything? Can\u2019t a fella ask his buddy to relocate, no questions asked?\nPenny: Oh, for god\u2019s sake, Leonard, this is about Priya, isn\u2019t it? She doesn\u2019t want me hanging out with you.\nLeonard: Yes. There, I said it.\nPenny: Okay, look, I happen to like your girlfriend.\nLeonard: And she likes you.\nPenny: No, she doesn\u2019t.\nLeonard: Not really, no.\nPenny: It doesn\u2019t matter. Look, I promise from now on I will keep my distance from you.\nLeonard: Well, now, hold on. What kind of distance are we talking about? Because we are neighbours. I mean, I can hear the toilet flush in your apartment.\nPenny: You can hear my toilet flush?\nLeonard: I don\u2019t listen for it, but it\u2019s nice to know everything\u2019s okay with your plumbing. The building\u2019s plumbing.\nPenny: Leonard, I get it. You\u2019re in a new relationship now. And I\u2019m happy for you. So why don\u2019t we just shake hands and part friends?\nLeonard: Well, now hold on, how about this? How about we still hang out, but on the down-low?\nPenny: Are you really that kind of guy?\nLeonard: No. I actually felt kinda silly just saying on the down-low.\nPenny: Good-bye, Leonard.\nLeonard: Penny, wait. (Bumps into door) Damned contacts.\nScene: The cafeteria.\nHoward: Incoming.\nRaj: Hi!\nHoward: Hey!\nSheldon: Hello.\nRaj: Why so glum, chum?\nSheldon: Apparently, you can\u2019t hack into a government supercomputer and then try to buy uranium without the Department of Homeland Security tattling to your mother.\nHoward: Oh, that\u2019s too bad. Figure out the magic trick yet?\nSheldon: Figure out the magic trick yet?\nHoward: Want me to tell you how to do it?\nSheldon: No.\nHoward: I\u2019ll show you one more time. Raj?\nSheldon: Hang on. This time do it with me, so I can make sure there\u2019s no monkey business.\nHoward: All right. (Raj looks over Sheldon\u2019s shoulder. Holds two fingers over his heart). Two of hearts.\nSheldon: I hate you.\nHoward: Yeah, he\u2019s gonna win the Nobel prize.\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "2_20": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Hu-u-u-uh\u2026. Hu-u-u-uh!\nLeonard: Problem?\nSheldon: This is Thai food.\nHoward: Here we go.\nSheldon: We don\u2019t have Thai food on Thursday. We have pizza on Thursday.\nLeonard: Yes, but we all agreed that the third Thursday of every month would be Anything Can Happen Thursday.\nSheldon: Well apparently the news didn\u2019t reach my digestive system, which, when startled, has its own version of Anything Can Happen Thursday.\nHoward: Come on, the whole idea behind Anything Can Happen Thursday is to get out of this rut we\u2019ve been in lately.\nSheldon: Rut? I think you mean consistency. And if we\u2019re going to abandon that, then why even call it Thursday? Let\u2019s call it Quonko Day and divide it into 29 hours of 17 minutes apiece, and celebrate it by sacrificing a goat to the mighty god Ra.\nRaj: I could go for some goat.\nLeonard: Sheldon, we agreed we\u2019d do something different tonight.\nSheldon: All right. Let\u2019s go to the comic book store.\nRaj: We went to the comic book store last night.\nSheldon: Last night was Wednesday. Wednesday is comic book night. Tonight, we\u2019ll be going on Thursday, because it\u2019s Anything Can Happen Thursday.\nLeonard: Way to think outside but pressed right up against the box, Sheldon.\nRaj: So what are we going to do tonight?\nHoward: If I may proffer a suggestion, in bars all across this great nation of ours, Thursday night is Ladies\u2019 Night. Which means, as the evening progresses, we will get better looking courtesy of 99 cent margaritas and two-for-one Jell-O shots.\nLeonard: Come on, Howard, the odds of us picking up girls in a bar are practically zero.\nHoward: Really? Are you familiar with the Drake Equation?\nSheldon: The one that estimates the odds of making contact with extraterrestrials by calculating the product of an increasingly restrictive series of fractional values such as those stars with planets, and those planets likely to develop life? N equals R times FP times NE times FL times FI times FC times L?\nHoward: Yeah, that one. You can modify it to calculate our chances of having sex by changing the formula to use the number of single women in Los Angeles, the number of those who might find us attractive, and what I call the Wolowitz Coefficient.\nRaj: The Wolowitz Coefficient?\nHoward: Neediness times dress size squared. Crunching the numbers, I come up with a conservative 5,812 potential sex partners within a 40-mile radius.\nLeonard: You\u2019re joking.\nHoward: I\u2019m a horny engineer, Leonard. I never joke about math or sex.\nRaj: Well, what are we waiting for? Let\u2019s bounce, bitches.\nLeonard: You\u2019re right. It\u2019s Anything Can Happen Thursday, let\u2019s hit the clubs and meet hot women!\nRaj: Here we go. Lock up your daughters! We\u2019re going to hit it and quit it.\nLeonard: Or we could finish eating and go to the comic book store.\nRaj: Also a good plan.\nHoward: Alright, but next Anything Can Happen Thursday, we\u2019re definitely going to a bar.\nLeonard: Oh, absolutely.\nRaj: You heard that, Ladies\u2019 Night ladies? We\u2019re eventually coming for you!\nSheldon: Fascinating.\nCredits sequence.\nPenny: Oh hey, guys, where\u2019re you headed?\nSheldon: To the comic book store. You\u2019re probably thinking, the comic book store? On a Thursday? Why, I\u2019ve fallen down the rabbit hole and into a land of madness. What you have failed to take into account, Penny, is that this is Anything Can Happen Thursday.\nPenny: You got me. While you\u2019re there, could pick me up a few comics for my nephew\u2019s birthday?\nSheldon: I think you mean comic books. Comics are feeble attempts at humour featuring talking babies and anthropomorphized pets found traditionally in the optimistically named funny pages.\nPenny: Leonard, could you pick me up a few comics for my nephew\u2019s birthday?\nLeonard: Sure. What does he like?\nPenny: I don\u2019t know, he\u2019s 13. Just pick out anything.\nSheldon: Just pick out anything? Maybe at the same time we can pick out a new suit for him without knowing his size, or pick out his career for him without knowing his aptitude, or pick out a new breakfast cereal without knowing his fibre requirements or his feelings about little marshmallows.\nPenny: Spider-Man. Get him Spider-Man.\nSheldon: Amazing Spider-Man, Ultimate Spider-Man, Spectacular Spider-Man, The Marvelous Adventures of Spider-Man, Spider-Man 2099?\nPenny: Leonard?\nLeonard: You know this can go on all night, why don\u2019t you just come with us?\nPenny: Ugh, that\u2019s what I was trying to avoid.\nSheldon: Oh, I forgot Sensational Spider-Man.\nScene: The comic book store.\n \nPenny: Oh, what a cute, little store. Everybody\u2019s staring at me.\nLeonard: Don\u2019t worry, they\u2019re more scared of you than you are of them.\nPenny: Unlikely. Here, what about this one for my nephew?\nSheldon: A superb choice.\nPenny: Oh, great.\nSheldon: Yeah, provided he has already read Infinite Crisis and 52, and is familiar with the re-establishment of the DC multiverse.\nPenny: What\u2019s a multiverse?\nSheldon: Get her out of here.\nLeonard: Come on, I\u2019ll help you pick something.\nRaj: That\u2019s right. She\u2019s with us. Guys like that are so pathetic.\nHoward: Tell me about it. Look, a new Batman belt buckle.\nStore clerk: Oh, hey, Leonard. Can I help you find something?\nLeonard: Oh, hey, Stuart. This is Penny. She\u2019s looking for some comic books.\nStuart: Oh, really. Blink twice if you\u2019re here against your will.\nLeonard: I think we\u2019re fine, Stuart.\nStuart: Let me know if you need anything.\nPenny: Thanks. He seems like a nice guy.\nLeonard: You mean for someone who\u2019s into comic books?\nPenny: No, no, no, I just meant for\u2026 yeah.\nLeonard: Penny, just because people appreciate comic books doesn\u2019t make them weirdos. Stuart\u2019s a terrific artist. He went to the Rhode Island School of Design.\nPenny: What about the guy over there in the superhero T-shirt tucked into his sweatpants?\nLeonard: Ah, yeah, that\u2019s Captain Sweatpants. He doesn\u2019t really help the point I\u2019m trying to make.\n(Howard and Sheldon are looking through a rack of comic books. Each says \u201cGot it\u201d in turn as they look past each book until they eventually reach the one in the middle when they both together grab the book and shout \u201cNeed it!\u201d)\n \nHoward: Let it go, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Why should I let it go? I saw it first.\nHoward: Yes, but I saw it from the front.\nSheldon: A far less impressive feat.\nHoward: Oh, come on! I need this for my Batman collection.\nSheldon: I need it for my Robin collection.\nHoward: Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock?\nSheldon: Why would I gamble? It\u2019s mine. Let go.\nHoward: You let go.\nSheldon: No, you!\nLeonard: Problem?\nSheldon: Yes, he won\u2019t let go of my comic book.\nHoward: It\u2019s my comic book!\nSheldon: Leonard, we need a ruling.\nLeonard: Uh, cut it in half?\nPenny: Excuse me.\nStuart: Hello again.\nPenny: Hi. What would you recommend as a present for a 13-year-old boy?\nStuart: A 13-year-old girl. But if you\u2019re dead set on a comic book, try this.\nPenny: Oh, Hellblazer. What\u2019s this about?\nStuart: A morally ambiguous confidence man who smokes, has lung cancer and is tormented by the spirits of the undead.\nPenny: Well, if that doesn\u2019t make me the favourite aunt, I don\u2019t know what will. Is this me?\nStuart: Depends. Do you like it?\nPenny: It\u2019s really good.\nStuart: Yes, that\u2019s you.\nPenny: That\u2019s so sweet, but what if I didn\u2019t like it?\nStuart: It\u2019d still be you, but I\u2019d feel like an idiot.\nLeonard: I don\u2019t believe it. Stuart\u2019s putting the moves on Penny.\nHoward: I have got to learn how to draw. Hey!\nSheldon: Once again, defeated by your own prurient interests.\nRaj: Guys, have you seen Stuart all up in Penny\u2019s business over there?\nLeonard: Nobody\u2019s up in anybody\u2019s business, let\u2019s just buy our stuff and go.\nPenny: Okay, you\u2019ve got my number, now, give me the picture.\nStuart: You drive a hard bargain, but here.\nPenny: All right. So, um, just give me a call.\nSheldon: So, Leonard, how are you enjoying Anything Can Happen Thursday?\nScene: The apartment. Sheldon has the comic book. \n \nSheldon: Look at that, that\u2019s a dent. Thank you, Howard Ham-Fisted Wolowitz. Did you just shut the TV off in the middle of the classic Deep Space Nine/Star Trek The Original Series Trouble With Tribbles crossover episode?\nLeonard: Apparently so.\nSheldon: Are you ill?\nLeonard: No.\nSheldon: All right. Then is it fair to say that you\u2019re experiencing some sort of emotional turmoil over the events involving Penny earlier this evening?\nLeonard: When did you pick up on that?\nSheldon: A moment ago, when you turned off the TV in the middle of }during the classic Deep Space Nine/Star Trek The Original Series Trouble With Tribbles crossover episode. Would you like some advice?\nLeonard: Sure, why not?\nSheldon: Then, this is the perfect time to launch a blog with an interactive comments section.\nLeonard: Gee, thanks a lot.\nSheldon: Would you rather I offer my personal insight?\nLeonard: I don\u2019t need any insights. I just want to know why Penny\u2019s more interested in Stuart than me. We\u2019re practically the same guy.\nSheldon: Oh, I disagree. Stuart is taller, artistic, self-employed and, most significantly, he gets 45 percent off comic books.\nLeonard: You\u2019re right, I really should be asking strangers on the Internet.\nSheldon: My original point.\nScene: The stairs.\n \nSheldon: Chinese food, vintage video games. After the nightmare of Anything Can Happen Thursday, this is Friday night the way it was meant to be.\nHoward: Who\u2019s up for Sheldon-Free Saturday?\nPenny (coming out of apartment): Oh, hey guys.\nLeonard: Hey, Penny\u2026 and Stuart, hey Stuart.\nStuart: Hey, guys.\nHoward: So what are you kids up to?\nPenny: Uh, Stuart has a piece in an art show that\u2019s opening tonight.\nLeonard: And you guys are going together, great\u2026\nStuart: It is great. Really great. Freaking awesome. What are you guys doing?\nPenny: It\u2019s Friday night, that means Chinese food and vintage video games, right?\nSheldon: Vintage doesn\u2019t even begin to describe what we have planned. Tonight, we are playing the classic 1980 interactive text adventure, Zork. It\u2019s the buggy beta version.\nPenny: Wow, Zork. Well, you guys have fun.\nStuart: Yeah, see you guys.\nHoward: See you, Stuart.\nLeonard: Hey, Howard?\nHoward: Yes.\nLeonard: Take me to a bar with women.\nHoward: Really?\nLeonard: Yeah.\nHoward: Okay! Let me just go inside and slip off my underwear.\nLeonard: Why?\nHoward: Well, if I get lucky, I don\u2019t want to be caught in my Aquaman briefs.\nLeonard (to Raj): Do you\u2026? (Raj checks his underwear) Let\u2019s go.\nScene: A bar.\nRaj: May I have a grasshopper with a little umbrella, please?\nHoward: No, he may not.\nRaj: Why?\nHoward: I\u2019m not sitting here with a guy drinking a grasshopper with a little umbrella.\nRaj: Fine. I\u2019ll have a chocolate martini.\nHoward: Wrong again!\nRaj: Come on, you know I can\u2019t talk to women unless I\u2019m lit up like the Hindu festival of Diwali.\nHoward: Look, there are plenty of bars in Los Angeles where you can order grasshoppers and chocolate martinis, but you wouldn\u2019t have to because there are no women in them.\nRaj: Gotcha. I\u2019ll have a Brandy Alexander.\nHoward: All right, the Three Musketeers just became the Dynamic Duo.\nLeonard: Should we talk to some of these women?\nHoward: It\u2019s way too early in the night for that. See, first we let the lawyers and the jocks thin the herd, and then we go after the weak and the old and the lame.\nLeonard: That\u2019s your system?\nHoward: That\u2019s my system. Oh, and if you spot a chick with a Seeing Eye dog, she\u2019s mine.\nScene: The stairwell.\nPenny: Oh come on. I think it\u2019s nice that Captain Sweatpants showed up to your art opening.\nStuart: Yeah, it would have been nicer if he hadn\u2019t touched all the cheese.\nPenny: Um, you know, it\u2019s kind of early. Do you want to maybe come in for some coffee or something?\nStuart: Oh, gee, it\u2019s a little late for coffee, isn\u2019t it?\nPenny: Oh, you think coffee, means coffee, that is so sweet. Come on, I think I have decaf.\nSheldon: Oh, good, Stuart, I thought I heard your voice. Do you have a moment?\nStuart: Uh, yeah, I guess.\nPenny: Sheldon, we\u2019re a little busy here, so\u2026\nSheldon: What are you doing?\nStuart: We\u2019re having coffee.\nSheldon: Isn\u2019t it a little late for coffee?\nStuart: It\u2019s okay. She thinks she has decaf.\nPenny: I\u2019ll just go look for it.\nStuart: What\u2019s up?\nSheldon: Well, I\u2019ve spent the last three hours in an online debate in the DC Comics Batman chatroom, and I need your help.\nStuart: Oh yeah. Those guys can be very stubborn. What\u2019s the topic?\nSheldon: I am asserting, in the event that Batman\u2019s death proves permanent, that original Robin, Dick Grayson, is the logical successor to the Bat Cowl.\nStuart: Ooh, Sheldon, I\u2019m afraid you couldn\u2019t be more wrong.\nSheldon: More wrong? Wrong is an absolute state and not subject to gradation.\nStuart: Of course it is. It\u2019s a little wrong to say a tomato is a vegetable, it\u2019s very wrong to say it\u2019s a suspension bridge. But returning to the original issue, Dick Grayson became Nightwing, a superhero in his own right. Batman 2 has to be the second Robin, Jason Todd.\nSheldon: Has to be? Has to be? I hope you\u2019re being deliberately provocative.\nPenny: I found the decaf!\nStuart: Oh, great!\nSheldon: Yeah, herbal tea for me, please.\nScene: The bar.\nRaj: Barkeep! Alexander me.\nLeonard: How about those two?\nHoward: Nah, they\u2019re eating peanuts, and my allergies, one kiss would put me in Cedar-Sinai for a week.\nLeonard: What about the ones in the corner?\nHoward: Possible, very possible. Do you want the one in the whiplash collar or the one who keeps blinking?\nLeonard: I think Blinky\u2019s cute.\nHoward: You got it, sir.\nLeonard: Wait, so we just go over there?\nHoward: No, we have a little prep work to do. Put this in your mouth. We walk past them, you stumble a bit. I say, sorry, my friend\u2019s had a little too much, and then I start to pull it out of your mouth and say, a little too much fun. Get it? I mean, they\u2019re laughing, we\u2019re laughing, and then we get them up to about a .15 blood alcohol level, and tell them we\u2019re millionaires.\nLeonard: What else you got?\nHoward: Depends. Are you willing to sit on my lap and pretend to be a ventriloquist dummy?\nLeonard: No.\nHoward: I can\u2019t sit on your lap, you don\u2019t know the routine.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment.\nStuart: I\u2019m sorry, but you\u2019re obviously stuck in a pre-Zero Hour DC universe.\nSheldon: Of course I am. Removing Joe Chill as the killer of Batman\u2019s parents effectively deprived him of his raison d\u2019\u00eatre.\nStuart: Okay, you can throw all the French around you want, it doesn\u2019t make you right.\nSheldon: Au contraire.\nStuart: Plus, you\u2019re forgetting that the Infinite Crisis storyline restored Joe Chill to the Batman mythology.\nSheldon: I am forgetting nothing and I resent your tone.\nStuart: Okay, look, Sheldon, it\u2019s late and I\u2019ve got to get some sleep.\nSheldon: So, I win.\nStuart: No, I\u2019m tired.\nSheldon: So, I win.\nStuart: Fine. You win.\nSheldon: Darn tootin\u2019, I win.\nStuart: Penny, I really had a terrific time. Penny?\nSheldon: No, no, no, no, don\u2019t wake her. She\u2019ll maul you like a rabid wolverine.\nStuart: You know, I don\u2019t think that was decaf.\nScene: The bar.\nHoward: Wait, is this your card or isn\u2019t it? Trust me, this was their card.\nLeonard: I thought you were good at this. You\u2019re always talking about how you go to bars and meet women.\nHoward: I do, all the time.\nLeonard: Well, what happened? We\u2019ve been sitting here all night and the longest conversation you\u2019ve had with a woman was when your mom called.\nHoward: Wow, you\u2019re just going to make me come out and say it, aren\u2019t you?\nLeonard: Say what?\nHoward: You\u2019re weighing me down. I\u2019m a falcon who hunts better solo.\nLeonard: Fine. I\u2019ll sit here. You take flight and hunt.\nHoward: Don\u2019t be ridiculous, you can\u2019t just tell a falcon when to hunt.\nLeonard: Actually, you can. There\u2019s a whole sport built around it. Falconry.\nHoward: Shut up. Let\u2019s just get Koothrappali and go. (They turn to see Raj with his tongue down the throat of a \u201clarger lady\u201d by the bar.) Lucky bastard. It\u2019s got to be that stupid accent of his. (To a girl nearby) Hello. I am Sanjay Wolowitz from Bombay. Okay, I\u2019m stumped.\nScene: Raj\u2019s apartment. He wakes up clutched in the arms of the large lady. Tries to get away. She clutches him tighter. He shrugs and goes back to sleep. \nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "4_14": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: A lecture hall.\nSheldon: Good evening. I\u2019m your guest lecturer, Dr. Sheldon Cooper. I was expecting applause, but I suppose stunned silence is equally appropriate. I agreed to speak to you this evening, because I was told that you\u2019re the best and the brightest of this university\u2019s doctoral candidates. Hmm. Of course, that\u2019s like saying you are the most important electron in a hydrogen atom. \u2018Cause, you see, there\u2019s only one electron in a hydrogen atom. Best and brightest, my sweet patootie. All right, let\u2019s begin. Show of hands, who here is familiar with the concept of topological insulators? Don\u2019t kid yourselves.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: I found another tweet from a student at Sheldon\u2019s lecture. Dr. Cooper has taken a relatively boring subject and managed to make it completely insufferable. Plus, he looks like a giant insect.\nHoward: Look. Listen to this one. Does Einstein\u2019s theory explain why time flies when you\u2019re having fun, but when you\u2019re listening to Dr. Cooper, it falls out of the sky, dead?\nRaj: Ooh, somebody took pictures and uploaded them to their Flickr account.\nLeonard: Wow. How do you get an entire lecture hall to flip you off at the same time?\nHoward: Apparently, if you\u2019re Sheldon, all you need to do is turn your back.\nPenny: Hey, Leonard, is your wi-fi down? I can\u2019t get on.\nLeonard: Oh, Sheldon changed the password. It\u2019s now Penny is a freeloader. No spaces.\nPenny: Thanks. What are you guys doing?\nLeonard: Sheldon gave a lecture at the university tonight. We\u2019re reading the reviews.\nPenny: Oh. How\u2019d he do?\nHoward: Well, picture the Hindenburg meets Chernobyl meets Three Mile Island meets Tron 2.\nPenny: That bad, huh?\nLeonard: Read this woman\u2019s tweet.\nPenny: Listening to Dr. Cooper has made me want to start cutting myself again\nLeonard: Yeah.\nSheldon: Good evening, Leonard, Howard, Raj, freeloader.\nHoward: So, how\u2019d the lecture go?\nLeonard: In a word, triumphant.\nLeonard: Really? Triumphant?\nSheldon: Oh, yes, you should have seen those young people. Thirsty for knowledge, drinking in my wisdom. I may have changed a few lives today.\nPenny: Oh, please let me tell him.\nLeonard: I don\u2019t know, I kind of promised Howard.\nSheldon: Tell me what?\nHoward: Actually, we should all share the moment. Raj, if you would.\nSheldon: Oh, tweets about my lecture. Hmm. That\u2019s rather unfair. That\u2019s downright cruel. Plus, insects have six legs. Yeah, I\u2019m not familiar with the acronym KMN.\nLeonard: Oh, uh, from the context, we think it means kill me now.\nSheldon: Well, I suppose everyone\u2019s entitled to their own opinion. I think I\u2019ll turn in. I didn\u2019t want to teach those poopy heads, anyway.\nHoward: FYI, I think that\u2019s what Darth Vader said just before he started building the Death Star.\nScene: The Cheesecake Factory\nHoward: Sheldon still moping?\nLeonard: Yeah, it\u2019s weird. Even though he didn\u2019t want to give the lecture in the first place, being rejected by those students really hit him hard.\nRaj: Mmm, I know the feeling. It\u2019s like accidentally walking into a gay bar and then having no one hit on you. It-It happened to a friend of mine.\nBernadette: Are you guys doing okay?\nHoward: Yeah, Leonard and I are fine, but I think Raj needs to meet a girl really soon.\nBernadette: Well, that shouldn\u2019t be too hard. He\u2019s such a cutie.\nRaj: Thank you, but cute is for bunnies. I want to be something with sex appeal, like, like a labradoodle.\nHoward: Labradoodle?\nLeonard: We might be starting to zero in on your problem.\nBernadette: Don\u2019t you listen to them. You\u2019ve got plenty of sex appeal.\nRaj: You really think so?\nBernadette: Yeah. You\u2019re a hottie.\nRaj: Well, thanks, Bernadette. And just for the record, labradoodles are hypo-allergenic, which is a very sexy quality to those troubled by animal dander.\nScene: The apartment.\nAmy (on webcam, with an undersea background): So, what do you think?\nSheldon: It\u2019s a charming illusion, but it does not cheer me up.\nAmy: Not even when I do this? (Pretends to be a fish)\nSheldon: No.\nAmy: Well, that was the last arrow in my quiver of whimsy.\nSheldon: Do you realize that teaching is the first thing I\u2019ve failed at since my ill-fated attempt to complete a chin-up in March of 1989?\nAmy: If this humiliating experience is really troubling you, there are things we could do about it.\nSheldon: For instance?\nAmy: Well, the first thing that comes to mind is isolating the part of your brain where the memory is stored and destroying it with a laser.\nSheldon: Hmm, no. One slip of the hand, and suddenly I\u2019m sitting in the Engineering Department, building doodads with Wolowitz.\nAmy: All right. Have you considered improving your socialization skills, thus allowing you to communicate more effectively with other people?\nSheldon: Isn\u2019t that their burden? I\u2019m the one with something interesting to say.\nAmy: Fair enough, but in its essence, teaching is a performance art. In the classroom paradigm, the teacher has the responsibility to communicate, as well as entertain and engage.\nSheldon: I sense that you\u2019re trying to slow-walk me to an epiphany. Would you mind very much jumping to it?\nAmy: Perhaps you should consider taking acting lessons.\nSheldon: Acting lessons. Interesting. It might help if I could act as though I care about my students and whether or not they learn.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment door.\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny.\nPenny: What?\nSheldon: You\u2019re an (finger quotes) actress, correct?\nPenny: I\u2019m not an (finger quotes)actress. I\u2019m an actress.\nSheldon: All right. You\u2019re an actress. I need you to teach me.\nPenny: You want an acting lesson?\nSheldon: Perhaps two. I\u2019d like to master the craft.\nPenny: Okay, where is this coming from?\nSheldon: It has been suggested to me that acting techniques could improve my lecturing, at which, if certain tweets and blogs are to be believed, I suck the big one.\nPenny: Yeah, I saw those. They were funny. I printed a few out and put \u2019em on my fridge.\nSheldon: So, when could we start?\nPenny: Okay, just to be clear. You are asking me for help because I know something that the brilliant Dr. Sheldon Cooper doesn\u2019t.\nSheldon: I suppose that\u2019s one way to look at it.\nPenny: I think it\u2019s the only way to look at it.\nSheldon: Are you going to help me or not?\nPenny: Probably. I\u2019m just enjoying the foreplay. Does this mean you are done mocking my acting career?\nSheldon: Oh, I\u2019m sorry, I thought making the transition from actor to acting teacher was the signal that one\u2019s career had reached the end of the road.\nPenny: Forget it.\nSheldon: I\u2019ll pay you 40 dollars.\nPenny: Saturday, nine a.m. Bring cash.\nScene: The university cafeteria\nHoward: Raj, I have amazing news!\nRaj: What?\nHoward: I just got offered a fellowship at the Weitzmann Institute in Israel.\nRaj: Dude, that\u2019s incredible!\nHoward: I know. The only thing is, I\u2019m gonna be gone for two years.\nRaj: Aw, I\u2019m gonna miss you. Are you going with him?\nBernadette: I have to stay here for school.\nHoward: That\u2019s what we\u2019re here to talk to you about. You see, Bernadette has needs.\nRaj: What kind of needs?\nHoward: Sexual needs.\nBernadette: Most of them regular, some of them kind of messed up.\nHoward: So, while I\u2019m gone, you\u2019re going to have to satisfy her.\nBernadette: What do you say?\nRaj: I say okey-dokey.\nHoward (to the real Raj who is daydreaming): What ya thinking so hard about?\nRaj: Just that I\u2019m definitely not gay.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment. \nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny.\nPenny: What\u2019s wrong?\nSheldon: Nothing. I was acting.\nPenny: You were acting?\nSheldon: Yes. In preparation for today\u2019s studies, I read Stanislavski\u2019s An Actor Prepares, Stella Adler\u2019s\nThe Technique of Acting, Uta Hagen\u2019s Respect for Acting, and Henry Winkler\u2019s Heyyy, I\u2019m an Actor.\nPenny: Well, good for you. Come on in.\nSheldon: How shall we begin?\nPenny: Well, I thought we\u2019d start with some basic movement exercises. You know, get our bodies warmed up a little.\nSheldon: All right.\nPenny: So I just want you to relax and kind of move around in the space. You know, just do whatever feels natural. Sheldon?\nSheldon (doing nothing): You said to do whatever feels natural. This feels natural. Certainly more natural than what you\u2019re doing.\nPenny: Come on, you got to work with me. We need to get connected with our bodies.\nSheldon: Penny, my body and I have a relationship that works best when we maintain a cool, wary distance from each other.\nPenny: All right, let\u2019s just say we\u2019ve warmed up.\nSheldon: You\u2019re the teacher.\nPenny: Okay. One of the things that might help you in connecting with your students is being a little more spontaneous. So why don\u2019t we try some improvisation?\nSheldon: Why not? It seems like you\u2019re improvising your entire curriculum.\nPenny: This is all about listening and responding.\nSheldon: Gotcha.\nPenny: I\u2019m going to create a character and a situation, and you just jump in when you feel it.\nSheldon: All right.\nPenny: All right.\nSheldon: Action.\nPenny: Okay, it\u2019s not a movie. It\u2019s improv. So no one calls action.\nSheldon: Hey, you taught me something. Who would have thought it?\nPenny: Okay. Uh, no, the shipment has not arrived, and I really need those shoes. They are my biggest seller. Yes, ladies sizes six through ten. Thank you. Oh, sorry, I have to go, I have a customer. Bye-bye. Hi. Can I help you?\nSheldon: I\u2019d like a frozen yogurt, please.\nPenny: Yogurt?\nSheldon: Yeah.\nPenny: Um, okay, sure. Luckily, we sell both shoes and yogurt here.\nSheldon: You do?\nPenny: Yes. Look up at the sign, and remember, improv is always about saying yes.\nSheldon: All right. Yes. I see a sign. It says Camarillo State Mental Hospital.\nPenny: What?\nSheldon: It\u2019s the only explanation I can come up with for why you think you sell shoes and yogurt.\nPenny: Okay, you know what? Let\u2019s just try a different improv. Uh, oh, this time we will be two winos living under a freeway overpass.\nSheldon: Oh, and we\u2019re going to use props?\nPenny: You bet. I had dreams, you know. I was gonna be famous. Show everybody back home I could be someone. Now look at me. Want some?\nSheldon: You have any frozen yogurt?\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: I\u2019m still not adjusted to how the SyFy channel spells their name now. S-Y-F-Y. That\u2019s siffy.\nRaj: Uh-huh.\nLeonard (phone rings): Hello? Oh, my God! Is he okay?\nRaj: What happened?\nLeonard: Hang on. Hang on. Uh-huh. Okay, thank you. Howard was on his scooter, and got hit by a truck. He\u2019s in critical condition.\nRaj: Oh, no!\nBernadette: Did you hear? Isn\u2019t it terrible?\nLeonard: Have you seen him?\nBernadette: They wouldn\u2019t let me in. Oh my Howie.\nLeonard: It\u2019ll be okay. It\u2019ll be okay.\nRaj: It\u2019ll be okay. It\u2019ll be okay. (Phone rings) It\u2019s Howard. Howard, hello.\nHoward: Raj, is that you?\nRaj: Yeah, I\u2019m right here, buddy. How are you?\nHoward: Shh, shh. Listen to me. I\u2019m not gonna make it.\nRaj: No, no, no, don\u2019t say that. You\u2019re going to be all right.\nHoward: Raj, I don\u2019t have time. Now, pay attention. My last wish is that you look after Bernadette.\nRaj: Of course, of course. Now when you say look after, you mean\u2026\nBernadette: Sexually.\nRaj: Excuse me, Bernadette. I have to hear it from him.\nHoward: Sexually.\nRaj: Got it. Take care. I guess I have no choice but to make sweet, guilt-free love to you over and over again for the rest of my life.\nBernadette: That\u2019s how I heard it.\nLeonard (out of Raj\u2019s daydream): Or it could be sy-fee.\nRaj: What?\nLeonard: S-Y-F-Y. Sy-fee.\nRaj: Oh, right. Good one.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment. \nPenny: So, did you get a chance to go over the scene I gave you?\nSheldon: Yes. I didn\u2019t care for it.\nPenny: Okay, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof is an American classic.\nSheldon: So is the McRib sandwich. I don\u2019t care for that, either.\nPenny: Fine. What would you rather do as a scene study?\nSheldon: I\u2019m glad you asked. I took the liberty of adapting a Star Trek fan fiction novella I wrote when I was ten into a one-act play.\nPenny: And you think it\u2019s better than Tennessee Williams?\nSheldon: Why don\u2019t we leave that for future generations to decide?\nPenny: Where No Sheldon Has Gone Before.\nSheldon: It\u2019s the story of a young boy who is transported from the ignorant backwoods of East Texas to the 23rd Century, where his genius is not only appreciated, but celebrated.\nPenny: KMN.\nSheldon: Now, in this pivotal scene, Sheldon\u2019s mother, played by you, argues with an emissary of the United Federation of Planets, Mr. Spock, the role I will bring to life.\nPenny: Okay, that\u2019s fine, but let\u2019s try and get you out of your comfort zone.\nSheldon: Why would we want to do that? It\u2019s called the comfort zone for a reason.\nPenny: Okay, the whole point of this is to loosen you up a little, so I\u2019m thinking you\u2019ll play the role of your mother, and I will bring life to Mr. Spock.\nSheldon: I\u2019m sorry. You\u2019ll be Spock?\nPenny: It\u2019s only logical.\nSheldon: Very well. I\u2019ll set the scene.\nPenny: All right.\nSheldon: East Texas. A warm summer night. A woman, Mary, stands on a porch. In the distance, we hear a lonesome train whistle. Woo-woo. The droning buzz of cicadas. Zzzzzzzzz. A coyote howls at the moon, frightening sensitive young boys everywhere. Aw-aw-aw! Out in the woods, an owl screeches.\nPenny: Okay, okay. We get it. You set the scene.\nSheldon: Hoo!\nPenny: Now just read your mother\u2019s line.\nSheldon: Shelly! Shelly, how many times have I told you not to leave your sciencey stuff out on the porch? Goodness, I\u2019ll never understand that boy. But then again, I\u2019m a religious nut, and my mind is closed to so many things.\nPenny: Woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo. Spock to Enterprise. Transport successful.\nSheldon: Glory be to Heaven, some sort of creature just manifested out of thin air. George, put down that Pepsi can full of bourbon that ain\u2019t foolin\u2019 no one, and get your shotgun!\nPenny: Greetings, Mary Cooper. I am Spock.\nSheldon: I\u2019m sorry. I just don\u2019t buy it.\nPenny: Just keep going!\nSheldon: Oh, my, your sudden appearance startles me.\nPenny: We have been monitoring your son Sheldon from the 23rd Century, and we have determined that he is now ready to join us. His unique genius is our best hope for bringing peace to a vast and troubled galaxy.\nSheldon: I understand. Oh, Shelly? A man\u2019s here to take you away to the future! Be sure to pack clean underwear.\u201d\nPenny: Okay, okay, let\u2019s try that last line again, and this time, maybe try choking up a little.\nSheldon: Why?\nPenny: Well, you\u2019re losing your son.\nSheldon: Yes, but he\u2019s going to a better place where he won\u2019t get beat up. So much.\nPenny: All right, come on, just try it my way. Pretend you\u2019re sad to see him go. I\u2019m gonna lead you in. His unique genius is our best hope for bringing peace to a vast and troubled galaxy. That\u2019s your cue.\nSheldon: I\u2019m sorry. I just love that line. Even the way you do it.\nPenny: All right, come on, come on. Put some real emotion into it. Blah-blah, blah, blah, vast and troubled galaxy. Go.\nSheldon: Oh, Shelly? A man\u2019s here to take you away to the future. Be sure to pack clean underwear.\nPenny: That\u2019s good. That\u2019s good. That\u2019s good.\nSheldon: Mommy, why are you crying? \u2018Cause I\u2019m gonna miss you, Shelly-bean, even though you creep the bejeezus out of me.\nPenny: Okay, I guess we\u2019re improvising now.\nSheldon: Well I\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s not my fault. I\u2019m just incredibly smart, and everyone around here is dumber than a bag of rocks. Oh, now, don\u2019t you start crying. You get in that spaceship. Mommy\u2019s late for Indian bingo.\nPenny (on phone): Mrs. Cooper, hey, it\u2019s Penny. Yeah, I think I broke your son. Hey, hold on. Talk to your mother.\nSheldon: Mommy, I love you. Don\u2019t let Spock take me to the future!\nScene: The cafeteria. \nBernadette: Okay, Raj, I know you\u2019ve been avoiding me and Howard, and I\u2019m not leaving until you tell me what\u2019s going on inside that little head of yours.\n(Scene turns into a Bollywood musical)\nRaj (singing): Like the wild elephant I am trumpeting my love for you!\nBernadette (singing): Like a hidden flower my sweet fragrance comes into view!\nRaj (singing): My heart burns for you like the sun at noon!\nBernadette (singing): My desert welcomes you like the rainy monsoon!\nRaj (singing): You are my heart!\nBernadette (singing): My universe!\nRaj (singing): You are my heart!\nBernadette (singing): My universe!\nBoth together (singing): My universe!\nChorus of everyone in cafeteria (singing):  Hey!

For your troubles.\nPenny: Oh, boy, a whole dollar. Now, I can quit my paper route. So, what\u2019s in it?\nLeonard: Mmm, doesn\u2019t matter. Half the time, he just ends up playing with the box.\nSheldon: Yeah, it\u2019s journals and research papers I wrote as a child.\nPenny: Aw, how cute. Is this like a diary?\nSheldon: No, that\u2019s my potty training journal.\nPenny: Really, your potty training journal?\nSheldon: Yeah. And forgive my crude penmanship. I didn\u2019t start typing until I was six.\nPenny: August 7, 8:42 a.m. This is humiliating. What was wrong with diapers?\nSheldon: There are some charts in the back where I kept track of shape, colour and consistency.\nPenny: Oh, disgusting.\nLeonard: No, what\u2019s disgusting is he\u2019s still keeping track.\nPenny: Why do you need all this stuff?\nLeonard: No, no, no, no.\nPenny: Sorry!\nSheldon: I am glad you asked. Are you familiar with the Higgs boson?\nPenny: Of course, it is, it\u2019s been in the news. And it\u2019s a very famous boson.\nSheldon: Nice try. Now, in 1964, Dr. Peter Higgs, accomplished self-promoter and physicist, he wrote a paper postulating the existence of a subatomic particle called the Higgs boson. Now, initially the paper was rejected, but recently, he was proven right, and now he\u2019s on the fast track to win a Nobel prize.\nPenny: Yeah, that\u2019s basically what I said.\nSheldon: Yeah, the point is Higgs is being celebrated for work he did 50 years ago, so that got me thinking, perhaps I\u2019ve already hit upon the idea that will win me my Nobel prize.\nLeonard: I didn\u2019t know they gave Nobel prizes for making boom-boom in the potty.\nPenny: You really think there\u2019s some kind of scientific discovery in here?\nSheldon: Well, this box only covers my work through nursery school. There\u2019s a good deal more to come. I didn\u2019t really hit my academic stride until I cut out that time-suck known as playing outdoors.\nLeonard: So, you\u2019re going to spend hours and hours combing through all this stuff?\nSheldon: That\u2019s a good point. My time is much too valuable. You know, perhaps I should find someone to do it for me. You know, someone with a rudimentary understanding of science, but whose real talents lie in menial labour.\nLeonard: Not gonna happen.\nSheldon: Well, if I didn\u2019t think you could handle it, I wouldn\u2019t be asking.\nLeonard: If you want help, just hire a grad student.\nPenny: Maybe I could do it.\nSheldon: You, really? You can assess the quality of my work? Okay, um, here. I wrote this when I was five years old.\nPenny: A proof that algebraic topology can never have a non self-contradictory set of abelion groups.

Uh, before we begin, may I offer you a refreshment? Water, coffee, tea, a marijuana cigarette?\nMs Jenson: No, thanks. I\u2019m fine.\nSheldon: Now, are you sure? Everyone\u2019s smoking them. I think they\u2019re the best.\nMs Jenson: I don\u2019t do drugs.\nSheldon: Excellent, yeah. That was a ruse. They\u2019re not the best. Physics is the best. And by the way, coffee was also an unacceptable choice. All right, so I see here you\u2019re from Des Moines, Iowa. Uh, you\u2019re summa cum laude in theoretical physics from Stanford University. Oh, and two years ago, you had a persistent ear infection. I hope that didn\u2019t cause any hearing loss.\nMs Jenson: No, of course not. How did you know about that?\nSheldon: I did a comprehensive background check. Medical records, credit reports, criminal history. (Hiding mouth behind book)  I trust you paid off those parking tickets.\nMs Jenson: Yes, I did.\nSheldon: Hearing unimpaired, good.\nMs Jenson: Look, Dr. Cooper, I really want this position. It would be an incredible honour to work for a man of your brilliance.\nSheldon: Flattery will not get you this job, Ms. Jenson.\nMs Jenson: It\u2019s not flattery if it\u2019s the truth.\nSheldon: Oh, well, thank you. Welcome aboard.\nScene: A University corridor.\nLeonard: You talk to Howard lately?\nRaj: Uh, yeah, last night. He kept making me drop pencils for him. I got uncomfortable.

I\u2019m down to my last three Tums.\nBernadette: You\u2019re going to be fine. You survived that Weight Watchers cruise with your mom. And they ran out of low-fat ice cream on day two. Just calm down and take a few deep breaths.\nHoward: Okay, okay. What am I doing? I\u2019m using up all the oxygen.

Looks like something used by Tinkerbell\u2019s gynecologist.\nPenny: Who I hope for her sake is not Captain Hook, so\u2026 who are you calling?\nAmy: I\u2019m going to video-chat Sheldon. If my new look leads to phone sex, I\u2019m going to have to ask you to leave the room.\nAlex: Dr. Cooper\u2019s office.\nAmy: Oh, hello. Who are you?\nAlex: I\u2019m Alex, Dr. Cooper\u2019s assistant. Can I help you?\nAmy: I\u2019d like to speak to Sheldon.\nAlex: I\u2019m sorry. He\u2019s asked me to hold all calls unless you\u2019re Stephen Hawking, his mother or himself from the future.\nAmy: All right. Well, tell him Amy called.\nAlex: Last name?\nAmy: He knows my last name. I\u2019m his girlfriend. We have a contract and everything. I\u2019ll send you a PDF.\nAlex: All right, I will tell him you called.\nAmy: Hmm, that\u2019s weird.\nPenny: What?\nAmy: Sheldon told me he had a new assistant named Alex. He didn\u2019t mention that Alex was a girl.\nPenny: Maybe he didn\u2019t notice.\nAmy: You\u2019re right. I don\u2019t have to worry about Sheldon.\nPenny: No, you do not.\nAmy: It\u2019s her I have to worry about.\nPenny: Oh, Amy, really? She is not going to come on to Sheldon.\nAmy: Oh, really? Look at this face (Sheldon\u2019s picture on phone) How can any woman spend eight hours a day alone with this face and not fall in love with it?\nPenny: Well, for starters, at some point, that face starts talking.\nScene: University corridor.\nPenny: Amy, this is crazy. You have nothing to be suspicious about.\nAmy: I\u2019m not suspicious. I just want to stop in, say hi to my boyfriend and meet his new assistant. (Throwing open Sheldon\u2019s office door) Aha!\nPenny: Can we go now?\nAmy: Hang on. (Rubs Sheldon\u2019s telephone receiver under her armpit)\nPenny: What are you doing?\nAmy: Isn\u2019t it obvious? I\u2019m spreading my scent to mark my territory.\nPenny: Come on, Amy. That is not gonna work.\nAmy: Really? Because just before you became my best friend, I did this all over your apartment.\nScene: The cafeteria.\nRaj: Has your, uh, assistant said anything about me?\nSheldon: Oh, in fact, she has. Uh, her exact words were, what is that guy\u2019s problem?\nRaj: I\u2019m in her head. Let the dance begin.\nAlex: Here\u2019s your frozen yoghurt, Dr. Cooper.\nLeonard: This should be fun.\nSheldon: Half chocolate, half vanilla, side by side, not swirled?\nAlex: Yes.\nSheldon: Half a teaspoon of sprinkles?\nAlex: Rainbow, not chocolate.\nSheldon: Two cherries?\nAlex: One on top, one on the bottom.\nSheldon: Stems removed?\nAlex: Um, top one, yes. I didn\u2019t check the one on the bottom.\nLeonard: Oh!\nAlex: I\u2019m so sorry, Dr. Cooper.\nSheldon: It\u2019s all right, Alex. I\u2019m not mad at you, I\u2019m just disappointed.\nLeonard: Wait, Alex. Do you want to join us?\nAlex: Um\u2026\nSheldon: Uh, Alex, a moment. I need a word with Dr. Hofstadter. Do you think it\u2019s appropriate for her to sit with us, given her station?\nLeonard: Given her what?\nSheldon: If I\u2019ve learned anything from British television shows on PBS, it\u2019s that servants dine downstairs with their own kind.\nLeonard: What?\nSheldon: It\u2019s a kindness, Leonard. Otherwise, you\u2019re cruelly tempting them with a glimpse of a world that\u2019s just beyond their soot-stained fingertips.\nLeonard: Oh, sure. Please join us.\nAlex: Oh, okay. Thank you.\nLeonard: So, Alex, what\u2019s the topic of your dissertation?\nAlex: I\u2019m looking for Trojan asteroids at Earth\u2019s L-Five Lagrange point.\nLeonard: Oh, that happens to be Dr. Koothrappali\u2019s field of expertise. You two have a lot to talk about.\nAlex: Is that true? Is he all right?\nLeonard: No. But compared to your boss, he\u2019s the poster boy for sanity.\nAlex: It\u2019s okay, I\u2019ve been around scientists all my life. My dad\u2019s an astronomer at SETI.\nLeonard: Oh, SETI, the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence. You should introduce him to Sheldon. The search is over.\nAlex: So, what kind of research are you doing?\nLeonard: High-energy lasers.\nAlex: Ooh. Military?\nLeonard: Not yet, but I can remove unwanted hair from two miles away.\nAmy (to Penny, on other side of room): You were right. I had nothing to worry about. That skank\u2019s your problem, not mine.\nAlex: You\u2019re very funny, Dr. Hofstadter.\nLeonard: Thank you.\nSheldon (choking): Cherry stem! Cherry stem!\nScene: Webcam conversation between Bernadette\u2019s Office and the International Space Station\nBernadette: How you doing, Howie? You feeling a little better?\nHoward: Oh, a lot better, thanks. One sec. Listen close, I don\u2019t have a lot of time. I need you to go to my house. In my bedroom, you\u2019ll find a model rocket. I want you to take it and bring it back to your place.\nBernadette: Okay.\nHoward: Step two, build a version roughly fourteen stories high. Fill it full of rocket fuel and come get me. I\u2019ll leave the door unlocked.\nBernadette: Howie, honey, maybe you should talk to someone, let them know you\u2019re having a little anxiety.\nHoward: No, no, I\u2019m fine. No anxiety. We should probably talk in code. From now on, frog is me, sandwich means you and lemon means rocket. So, come on, sandwich, build me a lemon \u2019cause froggy wants to come home.\nScene: Penny\u2019s car.\nAmy: Look at you, putting on a brave face.\nPenny: There\u2019s nothing to be brave about. Everything\u2019s fine.\nAmy: Really? I don\u2019t know how much you know about primate behaviour, but Sheldon\u2019s assistant was clearly courting Leonard. Were she a mandrill, she would have bent over and displayed her brightly coloured hindquarters like a big red welcome mat. By the way, you try that at the junior prom, you get kicked out.\nPenny: Okay, maybe she was flirting with him, but who cares? Look, I don\u2019t even know where my relationship is with Leonard is right now.\nAmy: So says your prefrontal cortex. But meanwhile, the limbic system of your brain is calculating that if another woman is attracted to Leonard, it must be because he\u2019s desirable.\nPenny: Well, of course he\u2019s desirable. I mean, he\u2019s great. He\u2019s smart, he\u2019s sweet, and, ooh, in the bedroom, whew, let me tell you, he really tries.\nAmy: So it does bother you.\nPenny: Fine, it bothers me a little. No. You know what? This is stupid. It doesn\u2019t bother me. Okay, it bothers me. But only because she wouldn\u2019t stop laughing. Leonard is not that funny.\nAmy: And there you have it, prefrontal cortex reasoning versus limbic lust. If this were a boxing match, they might call it the thrilla adjacent to the amygdala. If you were a brain scientist, you would be busting a gut right now.\nScene: The apartment.\nPenny: So, how was work today?\nLeonard: Ah, it was all right, I guess. Got to Heimlich a cherry stem out of Sheldon. Caught Raj right in the eye.\nPenny: Oh! You\u2019re kidding.\nLeonard: No, Raj had to go to the nurse.\nPenny: Wow. Anything else?\nLeonard: Mmm, the nurse is a woman, so he couldn\u2019t talk to her. She had to bring him a Grover puppet so he could point at what hurt.\nPenny: Oh, is that it?\nLeonard: Isn\u2019t that enough? It had the weaponised fruit and a puppet. What more do you want?\nSheldon (arriving with Alex): Oh, good, Leonard, you\u2019re here. Science news. This will interest you. And, Penny, feel free to paint your nails.\nLeonard: What do you got?\nSheldon: I believe Alex may have unearthed the grade school science project that could be my ticket to the Nobel Prize. Behold.\nLeonard: Magnets: What Do They Stick To? If the answer is metal, it\u2019s not exactly groundbreaking.\nSheldon: The original title was \u201cA Rederivation of Maxwell\u2019s Equations Regarding Electromagnetism\u201d\u201d I dumbed it down because some of the more religious people in town were starting to say I was a witch.\nAlex: Sheldon thinks the approach in this paper might change the way we calculate ferromagnetic hysteresis.\nPenny: Oh, it\u2019s about time. I hated the old way. Hi. I\u2019m Penny.\nAlex: Alex. Uh, do you work with Dr. Hofstadter?\nPenny: In a way. We\u2019ve kind of been involved in a five-year experiment.\nAlex: Oh. Well, you\u2019re lucky. He seems very talented. And I\u2019m sure a lot of people want to work with him.\nPenny: Well, a lot of people can\u2019t. Uh, hey.\nLeonard: Where are we going?\nPenny: My limbic system wants to take your pants off.\nAlex: She seems nice.\nSheldon: Notice people on your own time. We\u2019re working.\nScene: Webcam conversation between Bernadette\u2019s Office and the International Space Station\nBernadette: Hey, Howie, how you feeling?\nHoward: Better. Much better. The other astronauts held me down, gave me a shot. Oooh. Attention, people of Earth. Tonight, there will be two moons in the sky.\nBernadette: Howie, stop that. NASA\u2019s watching this! Put your pants back on!\nHoward: Whee! Whee!\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "4_12": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The university cafeteria. Howard is on the phone.\nHoward: Ma, Ma, calm down. Listen to me. I know it says click with the mouse, but on a laptop, the trackpad is the mouse. Now, put your finger on it. Doesn\u2019t matter which finger. Good choice. Now move it down to your e-mail icon. Yeah, the little envelope. What do you mean, what does it look like? It looks like an envelope! Fine, you don\u2019t like the computer, don\u2019t use it! Sure, we can exchange it for a salad spinner. Good-bye!\nRaj: That\u2019s a Hanukkah present you\u2019re regretting, huh?\nSheldon: I won\u2019t say that all senior citizens who can\u2019t master technology should be publicly flogged, but if we made an example of one or two, it might give the others incentive to try harder.\nLeonard: I had a great idea. You know how we\u2019re always having to stop and solve differential equations, like when you\u2019re doing Fourier analysis, or using the Schrodinger equation?\nSheldon: Howard doesn\u2019t. He\u2019s only an engineer.\nLeonard: I was thinking, we could write a little app that would use handwriting recognition, and then run it through a symbolic evaluation engine. You just use your smartphone, take a picture of the equation and bam!\nRaj: You know what\u2019s a great app? The one that makes fart noises.\nSheldon: You know, Leonard, that\u2019s actually a valid idea. Very good.\nLeonard: Can you say that and not make it sound like I\u2019m a cat who learned how to use the toilet?\nSheldon: No. The two achievements are equally surprising and equally admirable, though if pressed, I\u2019d have to give a slight edge to the cat. I\u2019ll save you the pain and nervousness of waiting for the answer. I agree to be part of your project. Congratulations.\nLeonard: Oh, yay for me. What about you guys? I can\u2019t promise anything, but people do make money off stuff like this.\nHoward: A few extra bucks would be nice. I could finally move out of my mother\u2019s house.\nRaj: Where would you go?\nHoward: I always dreamed about building a little place of my own over the garage.\nRaj: You know, if I made more money, I could take time off from work and give pretty girls submarine rides.\nHoward: What\u2019s that? Some weird sex thing?\nRaj: No. You take pretty girls underwater in your private submarine, and you show them fish. Why does everything have to be dirty with you?\nLeonard: I was thinking we could work on this at night, and then maybe in a couple of weeks, we\u2019ll have ourselves an app to sell.\nHoward: Sounds like we\u2019re in business.\nRaj: I think we should take a picture to capture this moment.\nLeonard: Yeah.\nSheldon: Oh!\nRaj (pressing button on camera phone. Camera makes a fart noise): Was that the best 99 cents I ever spent, or what?\nCredits sequence.\n \nScene: The apartment. \nLeonard: I checked the App Store. No one is doing handwriting-recognition differential equation solving.\nSheldon: Oh, dear Lord, shush.\nLeonard: What?\nSheldon: You have so few good ideas, Leonard. And you\u2019re just going to spill the beans in front of an outsider?\nPenny: Who, me?\nHoward: Sheldon, I don\u2019t think Penny cares about handwriting-recognition based differential\u2026\nSheldon (singing): The stars at night are big and bright, deep in the heart of Texas.\nLeonard: She\u2019s not going to steal our idea.\nPenny: What idea?\nLeonard: We\u2019re gonna write an application\u2026\nSheldon (singing): The prairie sky is wide and high, deep in the heart\u2026\nPenny: Okay, stop, stop!\nSheldon: Of Texas.\nPenny: Whatever your secret is, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s boring, so I\u2019m not interested.\nLeonard: It\u2019s not boring at all. You see, in higher order mathematics, there are certain sets of equations that\u2026\nPenny: Bored.\nLeonard: Satisfied?\nSheldon: Hardly. Consider this unlikely but very plausible scenario. A young woman alone in the big city. Her ridiculous dream of becoming an actress lies shattered about her.\nPenny: Hey, wait a minute.\nHoward: Well, hang on. Let\u2019s see where he\u2019s going.\nSheldon: Then it hits her. How is she going to survive? I mean, she has no prospects, no marketable skills. And then one day, she meets a group of geniuses and their friend Howard.\nHoward: Hey, I\u2026\nPenny: Hang on. Let\u2019s see where he\u2019s going.\nSheldon: She befriends them, and then lies in wait until they reveal a marketable idea, which she steals and sells to the highest bidder.\nLeonard: That is ridiculous.\nSheldon: Oh, is it? Well let\u2019s see you come up with an explanation as to why this woman hangs out with us all the time.\nPenny: Oh, great. You know what? I\u2019ve already mooched dinner off you guys. I don\u2019t need to listen to this.\nHoward: There\u2019s your answer, free food.\nSheldon: All right, I\u2019ve taken the liberty of drafting these workflow charts which outline our various duties and the path we will follow as we develop our ground-breaking new app.\nRaj: Hey, why am I in charge of phone support? Seems a bit racist.\nSheldon: A customer service representative with an Indian accent will create the impression we\u2019re a vast enterprise that uses overseas call centres.\nRaj: Oh. Very clever. But still racist.\nSheldon: Duly noted, Steve from Wichita.\nHoward: Why am I listed as your executive assistant?\nSheldon: Because the word secretary has fallen into disrepute. FYI, my mother\u2019s birthday is coming up. I\u2019m going to need you to pick up a present.\nLeonard: Okay, we need to stop for a minute.\nSheldon: Leonard, please, we can talk during our break. We have one coming up at midnight. We\u2019ll need snacks.\nLeonard: Sheldon, you\u2019re not in charge. It\u2019s my idea. I\u2019m in charge.\nSheldon: Oh, of course you are. Look at the organizational chart. You\u2019re clearly listed as founder.\nLeonard: Well, yes, and you\u2019re listed as Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer.\nSheldon: You missed Chief Science Officer, Chairman of the Board, and Head of the Secret Santa Committee.\nLeonard: Okay. You need to get clear on this right now. I am in charge of this project.\nRaj: Ooh. Leonard\u2019s going all alpha nerd on Sheldon\u2019s ass.\nSheldon: All right. All right, I\u2019m not going to argue with you. Sheldon Cooper is nothing if not a team player. Dr. Hofstadter, you have the conn.\nLeonard: Thank you. I thought we might start by talking about the user interface.\nSheldon: Oh, dear Lord, we\u2019re doomed.\nScene: Later. \nLeonard: So this button here will allow you to scan a new equation, but over here, you can press this, and just substitute new values for the coefficients.\nSheldon: Good one, boss.\nLeonard: What?\nSheldon: This diagram. I assume you were opening with a joke. It certainly buoyed up this employee\u2019s esprit de corps.\nLeonard: It\u2019s not a joke. It\u2019s the real design.\nSheldon: In that case, may I offer 27 little tweaks to make it slightly less embarrassing?\nLeonard: Sheldon, I think this will work. Let\u2019s just try it my way.\nSheldon: Oh, I\u2019m, I\u2019m sorry. I assumed that you wanted candid truth-telling from your employees, but I realize now, you want the mindless nattering of complacent yes-men.\nLeonard: Are you done?\nSheldon: If you say so, boss.\nScene: Later still.\nHoward: So right now, this button-press event is just triggering a dummy procedure call\u2026\nSheldon: How about this for the app name? The Surprisingly Helpful Equation-Linked Differential Optimized Numerator.\nRaj: So it spells Sheldon?\nSheldon: Does it? A happy accident.\nLeonard: We\u2019re not doing names now. Howard?\nHoward: Like I was saying, right now it\u2019s just a dummy procedure, but eventually, it will drop us into\u2026\nSheldon: All right, fine. If we\u2019re not going to give it a name, can we at least give it a secret code designation?\nLeonard: No.\nSheldon: Well, but hear me out. The atomic bomb was The Manhattan Project. Windows 95 was originally Project Chicago. For our app, I would humbly suggest Project Nodlehs.\nLeonard: That\u2019s just Sheldon backwards.\nSheldon: Another happy accident.\nLeonard: We\u2019re not wasting time with names right now.\nSheldon: I see. Is that decision open for discussion?\nLeonard: No.\nSheldon: Is the decision to not discuss it open for discussion?\nLeonard: No.\nHoward: Again, right now it\u2019s just a dummy procedure, but eventually, it will drop us into\u2026\nSheldon: I call for a vote of no confidence and an immediate change in leadership.\nLeonard: Oh Sheldon, stop it.\nSheldon: When in the course of human events, it becomes necessary to dissolve the bonds that tie three competent scientists together\u2026\nLeonard: That\u2019s enough, Sheldon.\nSheldon: All right, let\u2019s get right to the vote. Show of hands all those opposed to Leonard and his reign of tyranny.\nLeonard: Okay, that\u2019s it, you\u2019re fired.\nSheldon: Really? Why?\nLeonard: Because you\u2019re impossible to work with.\nSheldon: I see. And is that open for discussion?\nScene: The following morning.\n \nLeonard: What are you doing?\nSheldon: Oh. Good morning, shoemaker. I think you\u2019ll be pleased with what the elves were up to last night.\nLeonard: But I fired you.\nSheldon: Oh, I know. I\u2019m now an independent contractor.\nLeonard: No, you are now nothing. You have no connection to this project whatsoever.\nSheldon: But I made it better.\nLeonard: I don\u2019t want it better. I want it my way.\nSheldon: Well, that speaks volumes, doesn\u2019t it? All right, I suppose I\u2019ll go put on my bus pants.\nLeonard: What the hell are bus pants?\nSheldon: They are pants one wears over one\u2019s regular pants when one sits on bus seats that other people have previously sat on. But perhaps from your lofty heights atop the corporate ladder, you\u2019ve lost touch with the struggles of the common man.\nLeonard: Look, I\u2019m still happy to drive you to work. Nothing\u2019s changed in that regard. We\u2019re still roommates, we\u2019re still friends.\nSheldon: Except you identified me, your best friend, as a gangrenous limb that needed to be severed from the organism and tossed away. The desperate act of a little man with a big Napoleon complex.\nLeonard: You know what? Go put on your bus pants.\nScene: The cafeteria.\nRaj: Mm. Last night, I had a dream we got so rich from the app, you and I bought matching side-by-side mansions. But there was a secret tunnel connecting your front yard to my back yard. What do you think that means?\nHoward: It means after we play handball, I\u2019m showering at home.\nSheldon: Good morning, Friend Howard. Friend Raj. I see you gentlemen are enjoying beverages. Perhaps they would taste better out of these.\nRaj: World\u2019s Greatest Astrophysicist?\nSheldon: Don\u2019t thank me. You earned it.\nHoward: Howard Wolowitz. Why not World\u2019s Greatest Engineer?\nSheldon: I\u2019m sorry. I typed that into the label maker, but I just couldn\u2019t press enter. Now down to business. What would it take for you to abandon Leonard and join me in a rival company? Unless, of course, the mugs are sufficient, in which case, welcome aboard.\nHoward: We\u2019re not quitting on Leonard.\nSheldon: I understand. And your loyalty is admirable. But what if I were to up the ante?\nRaj: What are you talking about?\nSheldon: Monogrammed key chains with a built-in laser pointer. No? How about can cosies emblazoned with our university mascot? Go, Beavers. I\u2019ll be back.\nScene: The apartment. \nHoward: Okay, let\u2019s try this one. Spherical Hankel function.\nLeonard: Hold on. That\u2019s it!\nHoward: Eureka!\nRaj: Hey, we agreed when it was Eureka time, we were all gonna say it together.\nHoward: Fine. Let\u2019s say it together.\nRaj: No. The moment has passed.\nSheldon: Greetings, gentlemen. How goes your little project?\nRaj: You mean, Project Lenwoloppali?\nSheldon: Ah, a combination of all your names. Very clever. I assume Koothranardowitz was taken?\nLeonard: We\u2019re actually scanning equations and getting good results.\nSheldon: Oh, well then, by all means, carry on. I wouldn\u2019t want to impede your progress.\nLeonard: Howard, did you solve the install time problem yet?\nHoward: No. It\u2019s a little tricky. I\u2019m gonna try having it pick up the libraries dynam\u2026\nLeonard: What are you doing?!\nSheldon: Playing the theremin.\nLeonard: No. I mean, what are you doing with a theremin?\nSheldon: Playing it. I\u2019ve loved the theremin from the first moment I heard the original Star Trek theme. And it\u2019s been killing me that it just sits in my closet, gathering dust.\nLeonard: Sheldon! We\u2019re working here!\nSheldon: That\u2019s all right. I can barely hear you over my theremin. (Leonard pulls out plug) Well, that was a little uncalled for.\nLeonard: No, that was completely called for. We need quiet.\nSheldon: So, your project is more important than mine?\nLeonard: Well, seeing as your project is to sabotage my project, yes.\nSheldon: Don\u2019t beat around the bush, Leonard. If you don\u2019t want me here, just say the word, and I\u2019ll leave.\nScene: The hallway.\nSheldon: Could have beaten around the bush a little.\nScene: The lobby. Sheldon is playing his theramin.\nSheldon (singing): Nobody knows the trouble I\u2019ve seen, nobody knows my sorrow-ow-ow-ow.\nPenny: What you doing? Trying to contact your home planet?\nSheldon: I\u2019m practicing my theremin.\nPenny: Oh.\nSheldon (singing): Nobody knows the trouble I\u2019ve seen. Glory, hallelujah.\nPenny: Something got you down, there, Sheldon?\nSheldon: Leonard kicked me out of my own apartment. And his app team.\nPenny: Oh, honey, I\u2019m sorry.\nSheldon: He wouldn\u2019t drive me to work today. I had to wear my bus pants.\nPenny: Is that so?\nSheldon: Yes. And they\u2019re still sticky.\nPenny: Aw.\nSheldon: Probably going to have to throw them away.\nPenny: Hey, you don\u2019t need Leonard and his app. You can make one with me.\nSheldon: With you?\nPenny: Seriously, I have a great idea for one.\nSheldon: Is it better than your idea to move to Los Angeles and become a famous actress?\nPenny: Okay, look, when you see someone wearing shoes you like, you just snap a picture of them, and the app goes on the Internet to find out where you can buy them.\nSheldon: That\u2019s your app idea?\nPenny: Well, you don\u2019t like it?\nSheldon: I didn\u2019t say that. But no, I don\u2019t.\nPenny: Why not?\nSheldon: Oh, Penny, where do I begin? The simple-mindedness of your idea is exceeded only by its crass consumerism and banality.\nPenny: And Leonard didn\u2019t want to work with you? Imagine that.\nSheldon: I know, it\u2019s baffling. (Singing) Nobody knows the trouble I\u2019ve seen.\nPenny: Sheldon, I\u2019m gonna make some cocoa. Do you want some?\nSheldon: Do you make it with milk or water?\nPenny: Milk.\nSheldon: Real cocoa?\nPenny: That\u2019s what it says on the packet.\nSheldon: Do you have those little marshmallows?\nPenny: No, sorry.\nSheldon: Well, I suppose it\u2019s appropriate.\nPenny: What does that mean?\nSheldon: A disappointing drink for a disappointing day.\nScene: The apartment. \nRaj: Hey, look at this. 20 people from the university have already signed up for our private beta.\nLeonard: I\u2019m telling you, the Lenwoloppali Differential Equation Scanner meets a real need. We\u2019ve got a hit.\nRaj: What do you think we should sell it for?\nHoward: Well, based on the fact that our potential market is about 70 or 80 guys, and you want a submarine, I\u2019d say about a million dollars a pop.\nRaj: Well, what if we put out a lite version for half a million? You know, get the word of mouth going.\nPenny: Hi. I\u2019m sorry to bother you guys, but you\u2019ve got to come take your Sheldon back.\nLeonard: What\u2019s he doing in your apartment?\nPenny: Well, he was moping down in the lobby, so I invited him over, and now I regret it.\nLeonard: Why do you regret, uh, never mind, stupid question.\nPenny: Look, can\u2019t you just let him play with you until bedtime?\nLeonard: We\u2019re not playing. This is real work.\nHoward: We\u2019re going to be hundred-aires.\nPenny: Okay. What if I got him to apologize and promise to behave?\nLeonard: Then I guess we would let him back on the app team, and while we\u2019re doing that, you could take an aerial tour of L.A. on your flying pig.\nPenny: Okay. Wait right here.\nRaj: I\u2019ll tell you one thing. If I get rich enough, that\u2019s the kind of girl I want to take on a submarine ride. And yes, that time, I meant it to be dirty.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment.\n \nSheldon: Really? Leonard wants me back?\nPenny: Oh, yes. He says they are lost without you.\nSheldon: Well, we sure saw that coming.\nPenny: That\u2019s right.\nSheldon: You know what I\u2019m going to do? I am going to sit here and just let them stew.\nPenny: No, no, no. You know, they have suffered enough. Everybody\u2019s suffered enough. The thing is, you\u2019re going to have to offer him a face-saving way out of this.\nSheldon: How?\nPenny: Say you\u2019re sorry.\nSheldon: Oh, no. Mrs. Mary Cooper didn\u2019t raise her no liars.\nPenny: Okay. Um, how about this? You know how you\u2019re always trying to learn about sarcasm?\nSheldon: No.\nPenny: No?\nSheldon: I was being sarcastic.\nPenny: Oh. Good for you. So all you have to do here is say you\u2019re sorry to Leonard, but say it sarcastically.\nSheldon: Of course. He will hear it as an attempt to mend fences, as opposed to the withering condemnation you and I will know it to be.\nPenny: Yeah. Yeah, that was my plan. All right. Come on. Let\u2019s go.\nSheldon: Oh, by the way, thank you for the delicious cocoa.\nPenny: Oh, you\u2019re welcome.\nSheldon: Boy, I\u2019m getting good at this.\nScene: The apartment. \nLeonard: Okay, now that you\u2019re back on the team, let\u2019s get you caught up.\nSheldon: Before you begin, let me say again how deeply sorry I am for my earlier behaviour and how much I respect and admire your leadership.\nLeonard: Thank you. So as you can see, not only can you store your favourite equations, but you can forward them to your friends or post them on Facebook right from the app.\nSheldon: Well, I must say, I am impressed.\nLeonard: Thanks.\nSheldon: You all have clearly put in a lot of hard work.\nHoward: We have.\nSheldon: As a result, you have taken the most important step on the road to success, learning what not to do. Now, let\u2019s start fresh. Howard, we\u2019re going to need some tea.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment. \nPenny: Okay, these are Uggs. These are Crocs. These are knockoff Manolo Blahniks.\nSheldon: Bored.\nPenny: Look, you said it yourself, we have to create a database before you can write an alga-thingy.\nSheldon: Algorithm. You see, Penny, Alan Turing defined an algorithm\u2026\nPenny: Bored. Okay. These are Steve Maddens. These are Nine West. These are Target. Oh, but don\u2019t they look like Chanel? These are Michael Kors. These are Roxy. These are Sachel\u2019s. Oh, these are Betsy Johnson, they\u2019re so cute\u2026\nSheldon (singing at the same time): Nobody knows the trouble I\u2019ve seen, nobody knows my sorrow\u2026\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "8_20": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The cafeteria.\nRaj: You\u2019re wrong.\nHoward: No, I\u2019m not.\nRaj: Yes, you are.\nHoward: No, I\u2019m not. Settle this. Those little animated pictures on the Internet, are they called gifs or jifs?\nLeonard: Well, the G stands for graphics. That\u2019s a hard G, so I\u2019d say gif.\nRaj: The guy who invented it says it\u2019s jif.\nHoward: I\u2019m sorry, do you mean the guy or the juy?\nSheldon: Well, I\u2019ll give you three guesses why I\u2019m so irritated.\nHoward: Something happened different from the way you wanted it.\nSheldon: I guess news travels fast. It\u2019s true, a select group of scientists was invited to a weekend symposium at a former home of Richard Feynman, and I wasn\u2019t included.\nLeonard: Oh, Sheldon, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not because they don\u2019t think you\u2019re an elite scientist.\nHoward: Yeah, I bet you anything it\u2019s just \u2019cause you\u2019re a pain in the ass.\nSheldon: You\u2019re just saying that to make me feel better.\nLeonard: Look, you can spend the rest of the day being bitter about this.\nSheldon: Agreed.\nLeonard: I was gonna say or, but why bother?\nCredits sequence.\nScene: Mrs Wolowitz\u2019s house.\nBernadette: Hey, Raj.\nRaj: Hey, I got you a little gift.\nBernadette: Oh, that\u2019s a lot of Girl Scout Cookies.\nRaj: You know me. I\u2019m from India. I can\u2019t resist children begging. So, how\u2019s it going with the title to the house?\nHoward: Great, it\u2019s all done. The lawyer tracked down my father and got him to sign it over. I didn\u2019t have to meet him, I didn\u2019t have to talk to him, I don\u2019t even know where he is.\nRaj: Wow, so you\u2019re not curious at all?\nHoward: Nope.\nRaj: Hmm. What if he\u2019s in prison? What if he\u2019s a spy? What if he\u2019s in a Beatles cover band? I\u2019m just saying, if he\u2019s got your nose and haircut, he\u2019d make a killer Ringo.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment.\nWil Wheaton: Thanks again for agreeing to do this.\nPenny: Oh, it\u2019s cool, I\u2019ve never been on a podcast before.\nLeonard: Well, you picked a good one to start. Wil\u2019s had lots of great guests. Jonathan Frakes, Brent Spiner, Michael Dorn, Gates McFadden.\nPenny: Those are Star Trek people.\nLeonard: Yes.\nPenny: I only figured that out because I\u2019ve never heard of any of them.\nWil: I deserve that. I invited you on my show and I drove here.\nPenny: Sorry.\nWil: Okay, so, this is basically gonna be just like a little talk show. Uh, we\u2019re gonna take some calls, we\u2019ll talk about what it was like on the set of Serial Ape-ist 2. It should be really fun.\nLeonard: This is exciting.\nPenny: Yeah, so, how many people listen?\nWil: Most people download it later, but usually a few thousand people listen live.\nPenny: What? A few thousand people listen to you talk about nerd stuff?\nWil: Again, right in the ears, straight to the feelings.\nScene: The apartment. \nAmy: Can you please pass the salt?\nSheldon: Sure. It\u2019s not like I was invited to Richard Feynman\u2019s house and have anything better to do.\nAmy: Is this how the rest of the night\u2019s going to be?\nSheldon: I don\u2019t know the future. Do you think there\u2019s a chance that an asteroid could hit the Earth, destroying Feynman\u2019s house and everyone in it?\nAmy: No, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Then buckle up, you\u2019re in for a cranky night.\nAmy: According to the codicil of the Relationship Agreement which you insisted upon, we\u2019re not allowed to pout or be moody on date night.\nSheldon: You know I just put that in because of uterus stuff.\nAmy: Well, it applies to you, too.\nSheldon: I was afraid you might bring this up, so I have a work-around. There you go. As far as you\u2019re concerned, I\u2019m smiling. Although, I must admit, I\u2019m smiling a little bit at the moment because this loophole is so brilliant.\nScene: Mrs Wolowitz\u2019s house.\nRaj: So, Bernadette, have you thought about how you\u2019re going to redecorate this place?\nBernadette: You know, I\u2019m thinking ripping up the carpets, maybe lose the wallpaper, all new light fixtures.\nRaj: You know, if you knocked out this wall, it would give you an open floor plan, and then, it\u2019s a little scary, but could be fun, indoor fire pit.\nHoward: Hey, I grew up in this house, okay? No one\u2019s knocking anything down.\nBernadette: Okay, okay. When he\u2019s at Comic-Con, I\u2019m bringing in a wrecking ball.\nHoward (answering door): Can I help you?\nGuy at door: Hi. Are you Howard Wolowitz?\nHoward: Yes.\nGuy: Um, this is a little weird, but a lawyer was trying to contact my father, because his name was still on the title for this house.\nHoward: Wuh, uh, who\u2019s your father?\nGuy: Sam Wolowitz.\nHoward: Sam Wolowitz is my father.\nGuy: I know.\nHoward: Well, wait, so if we have the same father, are, are you saying you\u2019re my half-brother?\nGuy: I think so.\nHoward: Bernadette, weird things are happening out here.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment. \nPenny: I think I started to suspect it was a bad movie when I looked at the script and saw the title, Serial Ape-ist 2: Monkey See, Monkey Kill.\nWil: Uh, spoiler alert, after the monkey sees, it kills.\nLeonard: Psst.\nWil: I\u2019ve just been handed a note. I\u2019m going to read it. Wil, do you want more Diet Coke? Also, we have juice.\nLeonard: I, I didn\u2019t want to interrupt.\nWil: Uh, that voice you just heard belongs to Leonard, Penny\u2019s fianc\u00e9. Uh, Leonard, why don\u2019t you grab some headphones and join us?\nLeonard: Really?\nWil: Yeah.\nLeonard: Hey, great.\nWil: So, while Leonard gets set up, let\u2019s take a call. Hello, caller, you are on with Penny and Wil from Serial Ape-ist 2.\nCaller: I don\u2019t have a question. I just want to say I\u2019m a big fan of the movie. I\u2019ve seen it, like, ten times.\nPenny: Okay, well, I\u2019ll apologize for the first time, but the other nine are on you.\nWil: Thanks a lot, caller. You know that the movie actually has a little bit of a cult following.\nPenny: Really?\nWil: Yeah. I was at a science-fiction convention, and I saw a woman dressed as your half-ape character.\nLeonard: Oh, if she was with an Indian guy dressed like a banana, that was just my friends, Howard and Raj.\nWil: All right, it\u2019s time for a very special guest caller, a friend of mine, who you probably know as the director of such movies as Clerks, or from podcasts and books where he often reminds you that he\u2019s the guy who directed Clerks. Hello, Kevin Smith.\nKevn: Hey, man, yo, is everything okay, Wil? \u2018Cause it\u2019s been, like, two minutes and you haven\u2019t even brought up Stand By Me.\nPenny: Hey, Kevin. It\u2019s really exciting to talk to you.\nLeonard: It really is.\nKevin: Oh, you guys are very sweet. So, Penny, listen, I saw your movie.\nPenny: Oh, wow. I wish it was better.\nWil: Oh, don\u2019t worry about it. Have you seen some of Kevin\u2019s films?\nKevin: You\u2019re cruisin\u2019 for a beatin\u2019, Wheaton. Anyway, man, I dug the ape movie, Penny. And I thought you were, like, really great in it.\nPenny: Aw.\nWil: You know, I\u2019m in the movie, too.\nKevin: Yeah, whatever. Penny. Penny, how come you\u2019re not in more stuff, man? I\u2019d cast you in a minute.\nPenny: Seriously?\nKevin: Oh, yeah, man. I\u2019m actually in pre-production on a movie right now. Way different than anything I\u2019ve ever done before. It\u2019s called Clerks 3. You should come over and read for a part.\nPenny: Oh, my, I would love that.\nLeonard: You have a new job.\nPenny: Well, maybe I can do both.\nLeonard: I don\u2019t think you can do both.\nPenny: I don\u2019t think I asked you.\nKevin: Yeah, you tell him, Penny.\nLeonard: Stay out of it, Kevin Smith.\nScene: The apartment. \nSheldon: Do you think there comes a point in life when it stops feeling bad to be left out of things?\nAmy: Probably not. It\u2019s an evolutionary advantage to be included in group activities.\nSheldon: You know what? I used to be a fan of evolution, but I\u2019ve since evolved, and now I think it\u2019s dumb.\nAmy: Being left out is a terrible feeling. No one understands that better than I do.\nSheldon: Hey, look at that. Even in your example, you\u2019re all by yourself.\nAmy: When there was a lice epidemic at my school, everybody got it except me. I tried to fool everyone by sprinkling sugar in my hair, but I just got attacked by bees.\nSheldon: I can just picture them all right now at Feynman\u2019s house, probably discussing Schrodinger and at the same time, not discussing Schrodinger. See? They\u2019re missing out on hilarious jokes like that.\nAmy: And at the same time, not.\nSheldon: It reminds me of when my stupid brother and sister would build forts in the living room and wouldn\u2019t let me in. I hated that so much.\nAmy: You know, there\u2019s nothing I can do about getting you invited to the symposium, but if you wanted, we could build a fort.\nSheldon: Isn\u2019t that a little juvenile?\nAmy: More juvenile than this?\nSheldon: I\u2019ll get the blankets. You Google how to have childlike fun.\nScene: Mrs Wolowitz\u2019s house.\nHoward: You know what, I\u2019m being a bad host. Let me get some more coffee.\nBernadette: Oh, let me do it, Howard.\nHoward: No, I got it.\nBernadette: So, Josh, what do you do?\nJosh: I\u2019m studying oceanography down in San Diego.\nBernadette: Oh, how nice. I loved Finding Nemo.\nRaj: Enough chitchat. How do we know you are who you say you are?\nJosh: Why would I lie?\nRaj: Okay, you got me there. You here looking for money?\nJosh: No.\nRaj: A kidney, cornea, piece of his liver?\nJosh: No.\nRaj: You\u2019re in a Beatles cover band and you need Howard to replace your dad as Ringo.\nBernadette: Why don\u2019t you help with the coffee?\nRaj: Okay, but something smells fishy. And not just because you work around sea animals. That actually sounds interesting, and I\u2019d like to learn more about it. Hey, you okay?\nHoward: Not really. This guy shows up out of the blue, and now I have a brother? My father has another family?\nRaj: I get it. What do you want to do?\nHoward: I don\u2019t know. I, I\u2019d just like him to go away. I can\u2019t deal with this.\nRaj: All right, I\u2019ve got your back.\nHoward: Thank you. Come on. And I\u2019d like to point out, this wall just provided a lot of privacy.\nJosh: I can\u2019t believe my brother\u2019s an astronaut. That\u2019s amazing. What was it like?\nRaj: Listen, dude, it\u2019s time for you to hit the road.\nHoward: Hey, hey, the young man asked a good question.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment. \nWil: So, for those of you just tuning in, we are listening to a really fun fight between my co-star\u2026\nLeonard: No, no, no. We\u2019re not fighting, we\u2019re just having a conversation.\nWil: All right. We\u2019re listening to a really fun conversation between my co-star from Serial Ape-ist 2 and her fianc\u00e9, who doesn\u2019t believe women should have dreams.\nLeonard: Give me back that juice.\nPenny: What is the harm if I audition?\nLeonard: Well, what if you get it?\nPenny: I don\u2019t know, I make a movie, become rich and famous, win an Oscar, a Golden Globe and live an incredibly wonderful life.\nLeonard: From a Kevin Smith movie?\nKevin: Oh, I\u2019m hanging up now.\nWil: Don\u2019t you listen to him, buddy. You\u2019re awesome. You\u2019re one of the greatest directors of our time.\nKevin: I don\u2019t have a part for you, Wheaton.\nWil: And that was Kevin Smith.\nPenny: Thanks a lot.\nLeonard: I\u2019m just trying to protect you. How many times did I see you get your heart broken trying to make it as an actress?\nPenny: Okay, instead of protecting me, why don\u2019t you try being excited when something good happens?\nLeonard: I\u2019m always excited for you. I\u2019m excited that you found this new job where you\u2019re making decent money.\nPenny: Decent? I make twice what you make.\nLeonard: Wait, twice?\nPenny: Yeah.\nLeonard: Like, times two twice?\nWil: For those of you at home, Leonard just found out his fianc\u00e9e makes way more money than he does. Let\u2019s listen.\nLeonard: I went to school for half my life. I have a doctorate. I\u2019m still paying off college loans.\nPenny: Well, how much do you owe? Maybe I can help you out.\nLeonard: Wil, can we just turn off the podcast for a little bit?\nWil: For those of you at home, I am shaking my head no.\nScene: The apartment. Including fort.\nAmy: How\u2019s it going, Sheldon?\nSheldon: Wonderful. I just finished hanging the lights.\nAmy: Can I come in?\nSheldon: Yes, oh, but enter through the side. Batman is a load-bearing blanket.\nAmy: Amazing.\nSheldon: I know. This isn\u2019t the printout. This is my real face.\nAmy: What are we doing? This is a fort. Let\u2019s sit on the floor.\nSheldon: Roughing it? Okay. Everything looks so big from down here. This must be how Leonard feels.\nScene: Mrs Wolowitz\u2019s house.\nHoward: I\u2019m surprised you could hear me with this Thin Mint in your ear. Yeah, pretty cool, huh?\nJosh: Yeah. Anyway, I should probably get going.\nBernadette: Howie, have you noticed how often people say that when you start to do magic?\nJosh: Sorry, I have a long drive.\nHoward: Well, I hope I get to see you again.\nJosh: I hope so, too. I\u2019ve always dreamed of having a brother to play catch with.\nBernadette: Keep dreaming.\nHoward: Hey, I threw out the first pitch at an Angels game.\nJosh: Wow.\nBernadette: He did it with a robot.\nJosh: You had sex with a robot?\nHoward: That\u2019s not what she meant.\nRaj: But technically, yes.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment. \nLeonard: Hang on, if you\u2019re making all this money, where is it?\nPenny: In a safe place.\nLeonard: What does that mean, under your bed?\nPenny: No, it means a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds. I\u2019m not overly conservative. I\u2019m young, so my guy said I can afford to take some risks.\nLeonard: Wait a minute, you have a guy?\nPenny: Don\u2019t you have a guy?\nLeonard: Why would I have a guy? I don\u2019t have any money.\nPenny: Oh, sweetie, you should really get some money.\nWil: For those of you listening at home, how great is this?\nLeonard: Wil, I\u2019m begging you, just please turn that off.\nWil: Sure. And we\u2019re back.\nPenny: Leonard, why are you making such a big deal out of this? So our roles have changed a bit over the last couple years. This is the way life is. And I\u2019m sure in time they\u2019ll change again.\nLeonard: Great, you\u2019re not only more successful than me, now you\u2019re more mature.\nPenny: Okay, look, would it make you feel better if I did something dumb like sneak out of work one day to go audition for a Kevin Smith movie?\nLeonard: That would be great, thank you.\nWil: I\u2019m just gonna jump in here real quick. Leonard, a moment ago, you were dead set against Penny resuming her acting career, but now you\u2019re all for it. Is it fair to say that she played you like a violin?\nLeonard: Yes, it is, Wil.\nScene: Mrs Wolowitz\u2019s house.\nJosh: So, I have to ask, was the robot sexy?\nHoward: It was actually just a mechanical hand.\nJosh: \u2018Cause that\u2019s all you need, right?\nHoward: You are my brother.\nScene: The fort.\nSheldon: Okay, so the final four forts in the first annual best fort ever contest, or fort off, are, Fort Knox, Fort Ticonderoga, Fort Sumter and Fort Cozy McBlanket.\nAmy: I\u2019d say, Knox over Ticonderoga, \u2019cause it\u2019s got the gold.\nSheldon: Mm-hmm.\nAmy: And McBlanket over Sumter \u2019cause it has a higher thread count. Oh. Ten o\u2019clock. Date night\u2019s over.\nSheldon: Wait, no. We haven\u2019t picked a winner.\nAmy: We both know this one\u2019s gonna win.\nSheldon: Well, of course we do. Fort Knox doesn\u2019t have a secret physics lending library.\nAmy: Come on, I\u2019ll help you take this down.\nSheldon: Well, wait. What if, just this once, we suspend the date night parameters and you stay later?\nAmy: Well, as long as we\u2019re suspending the parameters, I could stay really late and we could have our first sleepover.\nSheldon: That\u2019s a big step.\nAmy: It\u2019s a big fort.\nSheldon: Very well. I will agree to a family-friendly, G-rated, boy-girl sleepover.\nAmy: PG. Some scenes may be too intense for younger viewers.\nSheldon: G-rated, with a warning for families with babies and toddlers.\nAmy: You got yourself a sleepover.\nSheldon: Do you need to borrow a toothbrush or pajamas?\nAmy: Would it alarm you to know that I hid those things here two years ago just in case this ever came up?\nSheldon: It would, but you know how much I admire preparedness. How did you know we\u2019d be in the living room?\nAmy: Who says this is the only one I hid?\nScene: The apartment. \nLeonard: Hello? What is this?\nSheldon: We built a fort.\nLeonard: Are those my sheets?\nAmy: Yes, they are.\nLeonard: Okay. Well, you kids have fun. I\u2019m gonna go to sleep.\nSheldon: Well, Leonard, don\u2019t you want to see the inside of the fort?\nLeonard: Yeah, I\u2019m good.\nSheldon: Oh, come on. I really wanted to tell someone they can\u2019t come in.\nLeonard: Okay, fine. Sheldon, may I please visit your fort?\nSheldon: I want to say no, but it\u2019s too glorious. Get in here.\nLeonard: Thank you.\nAmy: Okay, have a seat on the floor.\nSheldon: Not there. That\u2019s my spot.\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "5_20": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The apartment.\nPenny: Oh my God, I love this chicken.\nSheldon: Oh, you know what they say, the best things in life are free.\nPenny: Okay, you\u2019re right, I eat your food a lot. How about this, you can raid my fridge any time you want.\nSheldon: Oh, that\u2019s very kind of you. Next time I have a hankering to wash down a D cell battery with a jar of old pickle juice, I\u2019ll come a-knocking.\nHoward: Hey, Raj, you didn\u2019t send your RSVP in. I\u2019m supposed to ask you if you\u2019re bringing someone to the wedding.\nRaj: I\u2019ll let you know.\nHoward: Well, can you make it soon. There\u2019s a battle royale going on over the seating charts. In one corner, Bernadette\u2019s mom, and the other three, mine.\nSheldon: Yeah, I hate wedding receptions. I wish the bride and groom would take a cue from Bilbo Baggins, slip on the ring, disappear and everyone goes home.\nLeonard: Mmm, you liked Professor Guyster\u2019s wedding.\nSheldon: They had a make your own sundae bar. Ooh, that was a night to remember. Do you know, on the one trip, I just had a bowl of nuts.\nHoward: Anyway, you gotta let me know if you have a plus one, because if not my mom\u2019s trying to sneak in the doctor who sucked the fat out of her neck.\nRaj: Alright, uh, fine, I\u2019m coming and I\u2019m bringing somebody. Uh, Koothrappali plus one.\nLeonard: Who you bringing?\nRaj: Who are you bringing?\nPenny: He\u2019s bringing me. Who are you bringing?\nRaj: Wow, what a bunch of Nosey O\u2019Donnells.\nHoward: Come on, who is it?\nRaj: I\u2019m not telling. I\u2019m from Asia. I\u2019m mysterious. Deal with it.\nSheldon: Howard, are you having a make your own sundae bar?\nHoward: No, uh, I don\u2019t think so.\nSheldon: Well you should. 50% of marriages end in divorce, but 100% of make your own sundae bars end in happiness.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: Raj\u2019s apartment.\nRaj (on skype): Hello Mummy, Daddy, how are you?\nMrs Koothrappali: Pretty good, can\u2019t complain.\nDr Koothrappali: Oh I\u2019m sure you can. Just give it a minute.\nRaj: Listen, uh, there\u2019s something I want to talk to you about. I, I wasn\u2019t ready until now, but I think it\u2019s time.\nDr Koothrappali: It\u2019s finally happening. You\u2019re coming out of the closet, aren\u2019t you?\nMrs Koothrappali: We love you, and we accept your alternate lifestyle. Just keep it to yourself.\nRaj: No, I\u2019m not gay. If anything, I\u2019m metrosexual.\nDr Koothrappali: What\u2019s that?\nRaj: It means I like women as well as their skincare products.\nDr Koothrappali: Well, if you\u2019re not coming out, why did you call us during the cricket semi-finals?\nRaj: \u2018Cause I, I\u2019m tired of trying to meet someone and, I think I\u2019d like you to help me find uh, a wife.\nMrs Koothrappali: And just to clarify, a female wife?\nRaj: Yes.\nDr Koothrappali: Matchmaking, very smart move son. Much better than marrying for love.\nMrs Koothrappali: We married for love.\nDr Koothrappali: And it\u2019s been wonderful.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Quantum physics makes me so happy.\nLeonard: Yeah, I\u2019m glad.\nSheldon: It\u2019s like looking at the universe naked. (Shivers) \nPenny: Hi, you guys got a minute?\nLeonard: Sure, what\u2019s up?\nPenny: Well, I was thinking about Sheldon\u2019s little joke the other night about me eating all your food.\nSheldon: Oh, that was no joke. But I understand your confusion as I am our group\u2019s resident cut-up.\nLeonard: I\u2019m sorry, you are our resident cut-up?\nSheldon: Yes.\nLeonard: Prove it.\nSheldon: Knock, knock.\nLeonard: Who\u2019s there?\nSheldon: Interrupting physicist.\nLeonard: Interrupting physi\u2026\nSheldon: MUON!\nPenny: Anyway, I got a little residual cheque from my commercial and I thought, hey, how about I get the guys a little thankyou to pay them back. So, Sheldon, ta-da!\nSheldon: Ah! A vintage, mint in box, 1975 Mego Star Trek transporter with real transporter action. Hot-darn!\nLeonard: Where did you get that?\nPenny: Uh, from Stuart at the comic-book store.\nLeonard: You went to the comic-book store by yourself?\nPenny: Yeah, it was fun, I walked in and two different guys got asthma attacks. Felt pretty good.\nSheldon: Well this calls for an expression of gratitude.\nPenny: Ooh, am I about to get a rare Sheldon Cooper hug?\nSheldon: Not this time. Then they wouldn\u2019t be special. Thanks Penny.\nPenny: You\u2019re welcome. Don\u2019t worry, I didn\u2019t forget about you. Leonard, I got you a label maker.\nLeonard: Wow. No, it\u2019s great. Also, uh, mint in box.\nPenny: Mmm. And, I got you a transporter too!\nLeonard: Awesome!\nSheldon: Look, it was actually designed for my vintage Mr Spock action figure.\nPenny: Oh, that\u2019s great. Let\u2019s open it up and put him in there.\nLeonard: Ah!\nSheldon: Oh dear Lord. No!\nPenny: Why, they\u2019re just toys?\nSheldon: They\u2019re mint in box.\nLeonard: They\u2019re Collectables.\nPenny: C\u2019mon can\u2019t we just open one up and take a\u2026\nTogether: No!\nLeonard: Once you open the box it loses its value.\nPenny: Yeah, yeah, my mom gave me the same lecture about my virginity. Gotta tell you, it was a lot more fun taking it out and playing with it.\nScene: A restaurant.\nBernadette: Are you sure you want us here when you meet this woman?\nRaj: Oh yes. In my culture it\u2019s expected to have a chaparone to oversee a first date. Plus I want to make a good impression and, no offence, but with you guys here I look like six two.\nBernadette: The nuns always chaparoned the dances at my high school. They used to make us leave room between us for the holy spirit.\nHoward: Hindus do the same thing. Except they leave room for a cow.\nRaj: Listen, I love your charming racist humour, but any chance you could not knock my religion while she\u2019s here.\nHoward: Yesterday you made fun of me for eating lox.\nRaj: It\u2019s different. You\u2019re people don\u2019t worship lox.\nHoward: Well clearly you\u2019ve never been to brunch with my cousins.\nBernadette: So, arranged marriages. The parents just decide, and then you have to get married?\nRaj: Oh, no, no, I get a say in it. But I\u2019m sure whoever shows up will be better company than a threesome I\u2019ve been having with Aunt Jemima and Mrs Butterworth.\nGirl: Excuse me, are you Rajesh?\nRaj: Oh, yes. You must be Lakshmi. Uh, nice to meet you.\nLakshmi: Nice to meet you too.\nRaj: Oh, uh, these are my, my friends. This is Bernadette.\nBernadette: Hello.\nRaj: And this is Howard.\nHoward: Nice to meet you.\nLakshmi: You too.\nRaj: Please have a seat. (To Bernadette) I\u2019m thinking double wedding!\nScene: The apartment.\nVoice of Spock: Dr Cooper. Dr Cooper?\nSheldon: Is someone there?\nSpock: Down here, on your desk.\nSheldon: Spock?\nSpock: I need to speak with you.\nSheldon: Fascinating. The only logical explanation is that this is a dream.\nSpock: It is not the only logical explanation. For example, you could be hallucinating after being hit on the head by, say, a coconut.\nSheldon: Was I hit on the head by a coconut.\nSpock: I\u2019m not going to dignify that with a response. Now, to the matter at hand. You need to play with the transporter toy.\nSheldon: But it\u2019s mint in box.\nSpock: Yes, and to open it would destroy it\u2019s value. But remember, like me, you also have a human half.\nSheldon: Well, I\u2019m not going to dignify that with a response.\nSpock: Consider this. What is the purpose of a toy?\nSheldon: To be played with.\nSpock: Therefore? To not play with it would be?\nSheldon: Illogical. Oh, damn it Spock, you\u2019re right. I\u2019ll do it.\nSpock: Sheldon, wait. You have to wake up first.\nSheldon: Oh, of course. Set phasers to dumb, right? (Wakes up in bed) Goody, goody, goody. This is wrong. This is wrong. I\u2019m so excited, but this is wrong. I\u2019m gonna do it. I\u2019m doing it. I did it. Oh, that\u2019s what I always thought 1975 smelled like. One to beam down Mr Scott. Aye, aye, Mr Spock. Energise. (Spins toy). Energise. (Tries to spin toy. It sticks. Tries to get Spock out and toy falls apart.) Don\u2019t be broken. Please don\u2019t be broken. (To Spock toy) What did you make me do? Okay, okay, think. (Sees Leonard\u2019s toy) It\u2019s only logical.\nScene: Raj\u2019s apartment.\nLakshmi: My goodness, that was delicious.\nRaj: Well, I hope you saved room for chocolate lava cake.\nLakshmi: Impressive. What goes into making something like that.\nRaj: Well, you start off by trying to make chocolate souffle, and when it falls you panic, quickly change the name, and voila! Lava cake.\nLakshmi: I bet our parents are dying to know how things are going here.\nRaj: Well, let\u2019s see. Yup, three missed calls.\nLakshmi: Four missed calls, two text messages, and a failed video chat. I win. So, what are we going to tell them.\nRaj: I\u2019d like to tell them things are going well.\nLakshmi: Me too. But before we get their hopes up we should probably make sure we\u2019re on the same page.\nRaj: Okay, what page are you on?\nLakshmi: I\u2019m on the one where I\u2019m on a lot of pressure from my parents to get married and settle down, and have a family, and I\u2019m going to do it so they don\u2019t find out I\u2019m gay.\nRaj: Say again.\nLakshmi: I\u2019m gay.\nRaj: Like, dude on dude, but with women?\nLakshmi: I know a fake marriage isn\u2019t an honest way to live, but you of all people must know how difficult it is to come out in our culture.\nRaj: Why me, of all people?\nLakshmi: Well, there is a rumour back in New Delhi that you\u2019re, how shall we say, comfortable in a sari.\nRaj: I\u2019m not gay.\nLakshmi: Really? The chocolate lava cake? The little soaps in the bathroom? And I\u2019m sorry, but you\u2019re wearing more perfume than I am.\nRaj: That\u2019s Unbreakable by Khloe and Lamar. And for your information, it\u2019s unisex.\nLakshmi: Fill in the blank. I love the nightlife?\nRaj: I like to boogie.\nLakshmi: Got you.\nRaj: W-w-with women. I like to boogie with women.\nLakshmi: That\u2019s disappointing. You were exactly the kind of phoney-baloney husband I was looking for.\nRaj: Thankyou. And once again, my baloney likes girls. Wait-wait. You don\u2019t want to put a bit of that in your mouth without trying my homemade chantilly cream. Yeah, okay, that time I heard it.\nScene: Sheldon\u2019s bedroom. Sheldon writhes in bed, then wakes up on an alien planet. \nSheldon: Oh dear. Two suns and no sunscreen.\nSpock: Hello again, Sheldon.\nSheldon: What is it now, tiny Spock?\nSpock: I am very disappointed in you. You broke your toy and switched it with Leonard\u2019s. You should be ashamed of yourself.\nSheldon: You\u2019re the one who told me to play with it.\nSpock: If I told you to jump off the bridge of the Enterprise, would you do it?\nSheldon: No. If I got on the bridge of the Enterprise, I would never, ever leave.\nSpock: Trust me, it gets old after a while. You must right your wrong, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Why? I got away with it. Leonard has his toy, and he\u2019s never going to open it, so he won\u2019t know it\u2019s broken. And I have a toy that isn\u2019t broken. Everybody\u2019s happy.\nSpock: Well I am unhappy.\nSheldon: I thought where you come from they don\u2019t have emotions.\nSpock: I come from a factory in Taiwan. Now do the right thing.\nSheldon: You know what you are? Well, you\u2019re a green blooded buzzkill. Perhaps it\u2019s time you beam on out of here.\nSpock: Fine. I will just use the transporter. Oh, right. You broke it.\nSheldon: Very well. Cooper to Enterprise, one to beam up. Energise. (Throws Spock away. Get\u2019s attacked by a Gorn. Wakes up.) Ah. Tiny Spock. Help.\nScene: Howard\u2019s laboratory. Howard is soldering something.\nRaj: Ready for lunch?\nHoward: Yep, one sec. (Puts thing in mouth.) Ah, good. Ma would have killed me if she\u2019d found out I\u2019d broke my retainer.\nRaj: Hey, uh, can I run something by you? It\u2019s about Lakshmi.\nHoward: Yeah. Sure. How are things going?\nRaj: We hit a couple of bumps. She lives over on Manhattan Beach, so it takes over an hour to get there. And she\u2019s a lesbian.\nHoward: What do you mean, she\u2019s a lesbian?\nRaj: Well, you know whenever you and I would try to hit on women in bars, and they\u2019d blow us off, and then we\u2019d tell each other they were probably gay. It\u2019s like that. Except this time it\u2019s true.\nHoward: Then why did she even go out with you?\nRaj: She was looking for a husband so she can appear to be straight. And you know, it sounded crazy to me at first, but I\u2019m actually thinking about doing it.\nHoward: Okay, well, so the reason that might sound crazy, is \u2019cause it\u2019s crazy.\nRaj: Look, Howard, you\u2019re in a relationship. You know you have to make compromises.\nHoward: Well, yes. But my compromises are about which bedspread to buy, or whose turn it is to do the laundry, Bernadette\u2019s or my mom\u2019s.\nRaj: It\u2019s a great deal. We both get our parents off our backs. I don\u2019t have to come home to an empty apartment every night, plus, once I\u2019m married, I can finally eat carbs again and let myself go.\nHoward: Why don\u2019t you tell your parents you want to try and find someone else, you know, maybe one who hasn\u2019t slept with more women than you.\nRaj: Because this one wants to marry me. I might never find another one who does.\nHoward: So you\u2019re seriously thinking about marrying someone you\u2019re never going to have sex with.\nRaj: I can\u2019t believe your attitude. I thought you were in favour of gay people getting married.\nHoward: Yes, to other gay people.\nRaj: Do you hear how homophobic you sound?\nScene: The apartment. Sheldon is working on his laptop. Spock is looking at him judgementally. He switches the two toys.\nSheldon: Oh, I don\u2019t want a broken toy. (Switches them back again. Penny and Leonard enter.) Nothing!\nLeonard: What?\nSheldon: Nothing. I said nothing.\nPenny: That was weird.\nLeonard: Really? I don\u2019t even notice any more.\nPenny: I cannot believe you guys aren\u2019t going to play with these.\nLeonard: Well I told you, you don\u2019t, it\u2019s mint in box.\nPenny: I dunno. I just think it\u2019s a waste. (Picks up box. Sheldon screams.) Relax. I\u2019m just looking at the box.\nSheldon: Perhaps you should look with your eyes, and not your muscular Nebraska man-hands.\nPenny: What is your problem?\nSheldon: My problem is that I don\u2019t want you to break Leonard\u2019s toy, which you probably did by shaking it. She shook it. We all saw her.\nPenny: Leonard, I bought you this because I wanted you to have fun with it. I don\u2019t want it to just sit in this box.\nLeonard: You know, you\u2019re right. I mean, it\u2019s from you, I\u2019m never going to sell it. I\u2019m opening it.\nPenny: Yes.\nSheldon: Mmmmm!\nLeonard: It\u2019s broken.\nPenny: What?\nSheldon: Oh, nice job, man-hands.\nPenny: I didn\u2019t break it. I, I guess Stuart sold it to me like this.\nSheldon: Yes. Yes, he did, that is a perfectly satisfying and plausible explanation. Yeah, let\u2019s all be mad at Stuart.\nPenny: You know, I paid a lot for this. Let\u2019s take it over there and show him.\nLeonard: Absolutely.\nSheldon: Wait. It was me. I opened your toy, discovered it was broken and didn\u2019t tell you.\nLeonard: Why would you open mine?\nSheldon: I didn\u2019t. That was a lie. I opened my own toy. And it was already broken so I switched them.\nLeonard: Well, you should talk to Stuart.\nSheldon: I can\u2019t because that was a lie. Yours was broken in an earthquake. And that\u2019s a lie.\nPenny: What is the truth?\nSheldon: My Mr Spock doll came to me in a dream and forced me to open it. And when the toy broke I switched it for yours. Later he encouraged me to do the right thing and I defied him. And then I was attacked by a Gorn.\nLeonard: Okay, that I believe.\nPenny: Mmm.\nSheldon: Leonard, Penny, I just, I want you both to know that I regret my actions toward the two of you. That\u2019s a lie.\nLeonard: So, is that one mine.\nSheldon: Yes.\nLeonard: Well, hand it over so I can open it.\nSheldon: Okay. Leonard, even though I don\u2019t have one any more, I hope you have fun playing with it.\nLeonard: And that\u2019s a lie, right?\nSheldon: Big fat whopper. I hope it breaks.\nScene: Raj\u2019s apartment.\nRaj: This is a treat, what brings you guys by?\nBernadette: Raj, Howie told me what\u2019s going on with you and Lakshmi.\nRaj: What, you told her?\nHoward: I told everybody.\nBernadette: We believe there\u2019s someone out there who\u2019ll love you for you.\nHoward: Well, actually we kind of agreed to disagree on that one, but we both think you shouldn\u2019t marry this woman.\nRaj: So, while I\u2019m waiting for this mysterious perfect match, who may or may not exist, I\u2019m supposed to just be alone.\nBernadette: Not necessarily. I think we\u2019ve found someone for you to cuddle with. (Pulls a puppy out of her bag.)\nRaj: Oh, my goodness. Aren\u2019t you the cutest little Yorkie ever? You got him for me?\nHoward: Her. We thought you two would hit it off.\nRaj: I think we already have. Thank you guys so much. Let\u2019s see if you fit in my man purse.\nBernadette: Metrosexual my ass.\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "8_14": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: Penny\u2019s apartment.\nPenny: So, tell me about your day, how\u2019s it going with the particle detector?\nLeonard: Wow, you remember that?\nPenny: Yeah, I listen to what you say. You\u2019re building a particle detector using superfluid helium.\nLeonard: You know, when you talk like that, I want to take you right here on this table.\nPenny: And you know from past experience this table cannot support both our weight. So, how\u2019s the detector going?\nLeonard: Well, it\u2019s tricky working with superfluids. Whatever container you put them in, they kind of creep up the sides and crawl out all on their own.\nPenny: Kind of like Sheldon\u2019s ant farm.\nLeonard: Exactly, except you don\u2019t have a lunatic running around, yelling, I fed you sugar water, why are you biting me? Come on, this is boring, you really want to talk about this?\nPenny: No, I do. I didn\u2019t write superfluid helium on this napkin for nothing.\nLeonard: Okay, well, this is cool. Uh, there\u2019s a thing called superfluid vacuum theory, where empty space is imagined as a superfluid with all of its qualities, viscosity, density, surface tension\u2026\nPenny: Hey, if you\u2019re pausing for dramatic effect, I\u2019d keep it moving.\nLeonard: No, no. People don\u2019t talk about surface tension. If you imagine our three-space as the surface of an N-dimensional superfluid bubble\u2026 This is exciting. This is really exciting. I have to go find Sheldon.\nPenny: Okay, well, if you find him, use the kitchen island, that coffee table will not support both of you.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: Which means a spherical multidimensional superfluid shows the same negative-energy density as space-time. So what do you think? What do you think? So what do you think?\nSheldon: Hmm.\nLeonard: What? Is it wrong? Have you seen it somewhere else?\nSheldon: Hmm.\nLeonard: I know this isn\u2019t my area, and I could never do the math like you can, but could this be something?\nSheldon: Well, you could have set Newton\u2019s gravitational constant to one. And, ugh, the whole thing reeks of blueberry. You know I can\u2019t stand these scented markers.\nLeonard: No one told you to taste them. Come on, is, is this good or not?\nSheldon: It\u2019s good.\nLeonard: Really?\nSheldon: I like it. I think you\u2019re on to something.\nLeonard: You do? You\u2019re not messing with me?\nSheldon: Not at all. In fact, I have got something for just such an occasion. I was starting to think I might never get a chance to give it to you. Good job.\nLeonard: You\u2019re giving me a sticker?\nSheldon: Not just a sticker. That is a sticker of a kitty saying me-wow.\nLeonard: I\u2019m not a preschooler.\nSheldon: Fine, I\u2019ll take it back.\nLeonard: I earned this. Back off.\nCredits sequence. \nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: You\u2019re still awake?\nSheldon: For a man whose last observation was our universe may be the surface of a multidimensional supercooled liquid, you\u2019re still awake seems like quite the sophomore slump.\nLeonard: You worked out all the math.\nSheldon: Oh, I did more than work out all the math. I wrote a paper.\nLeonard: You wrote a paper on my idea?\nSheldon: I wrote a paper on our idea.\nLeonard: When did my idea become our idea?\nSheldon: When I mixed it with Sheldony goodness and cooked it in the Easy-Bake oven of my mind.\nLeonard: This is good. Our idea is really good.\nSheldon: Well, the lightbulb in this oven is ridiculously bright.\nLeonard: You know, if no one\u2019s thought of this, yet, this could be a big deal.\nSheldon: Only way we\u2019ll know for sure is if we post it online to the pre-print server. I have it ready to go, but I wasn\u2019t gonna do it without you.\nLeonard: Wow, it\u2019s all happening so fast. Should we just sleep on it?\nSheldon: We could, but we always run the risk of someone else beating us to the punch.\nLeonard: You\u2019re sure it\u2019s good?\nSheldon: My name is right on there with yours. That is a surefire mark of quality. That might as well say directed by Joss Whedon.\nLeonard: Okay, partner, let\u2019s do it.\nSheldon: Come on. Click the mouse with me.\nLeonard: One, two three.\nTogether: Click.\nLeonard: Well, we did it.\nSheldon: Yes, we did, my friend.\nLeonard: Is your tongue blue?\nSheldon: I don\u2019t want to talk about it.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment. \nBernadette: Okay, movie night, what do you want to watch?\nAmy: Whatever happened to that ape movie you were in?\nPenny: Oh, God. Probably nothing. I think I saw the director twirling a sign outside the Verizon store.\nBernadette: Search for it.\nPenny: What, no, why?\nBernadette: \u2018Cause it would be fun to watch.\nPenny: It would be humiliating.\nBernadette: Well, now we have two reasons.\nAmy: They have it.\nBernadette: Please, can we watch it?\nAmy: Please?\nPenny: Fine, but I\u2019m telling you, it\u2019s terrible.\nAmy: Have you even seen it?\nPenny: No.\nBernadette: Well, maybe it turned out better than you think.\nVoice on TV: Bananas, get your fresh bananas.\nBernadette: Ho-ho, it really didn\u2019t.\nScene: Leonard\u2019s laboratory.\nLeonard: Sheldon, this is superfluid helium. Put this in your mouth, your tongue will freeze and break off.\nSheldon: Does it smell like blueberries?\nLeonard: No.\nSheldon: Then we\u2019re probably okay.\nHoward: Hey, your paper got mentioned on the Quantum Diaries physics blog.\nLeonard: Really? What\u2019d they say?\nHoward: Uh, it\u2019s basically a summary of the theory, but there\u2019s a bunch of positive comments on the message board.\nLeonard: Let me see, let me see. One calls it insightful and innovative. We\u2019re insightful and innovative.\nSheldon: Oh, nice to meet you, Mr. Insightful.\nLeonard: Oh, the pleasure is mine, Mr. Innovative. Uh, another one says the concept shows some real out-of-the-box thinking. Do you hear that, Mr. Out-Of-The?\nSheldon: I do, indeed, Mr. Box-Thinking.\nHoward: How are you today, Mr. Can-You-Believe-These-Jack-Asses?\nRaj: Just dandy, Mr I-Wish-I-Was-Better-At-Improv.\nSheldon: Read another one.\nLeonard: Okay, okay. Uh, the analogy between space-time and a supercooled fluid is either meaningless or false. I wish this blog would devote itself to real science instead of wasting our time with crackpot wannabe theoreticians in a rush to publish.\nSheldon: Who wrote that?\nLeonard: It\u2019s anonymous, and user name General Relativity.\nSheldon: Well, I\u2019m responding to it.\nLeonard: Uh, don\u2019t lower yourself to their level.\nSheldon: Look, I am simply going to defend our work, scientist to scientist. And failing that, suggest that his mother enjoys a string of both human and non-human lovers.\nLeonard: Sheldon, my name\u2019s on that paper, too. There\u2019s no upside to doing this.\nSheldon: He just left another comment.\nRaj: What does it say?\nLeonard: Upon review, I\u2019ve changed my mind about the Cooper-Hofstadter hypothesis that space-time is like a superfluid. In fact, it\u2019s inspired me to come up with my own theory. Maybe space-time is like two clowns with their heads in a bucket, much like Cooper and Hofstadter.\nSheldon: Can I respond now?\nLeonard: Do it.\nSheldon: You mess with the bull, you get the horns. I\u2019m about to show this guy just how horny I can be.\nLeonard: Somebody else do it.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment.\nPenny (on television): Doctor, please help me. I think I might be turning into a killer gorilla.\nDoctor: Why do you think you\u2019re turning into a killer gorilla and not just a regular gorilla?\nPenny (on television): Because regular gorillas are vegetarians, and I just bit the fingers off your receptionist.\nPenny: Okay, we\u2019ve seen plenty.\nBernadette: No, give me the remote.\nAmy: Careful. She\u2019ll bite your fingers off.\nPenny: Okay, well, I\u2019ve been poking around the internet, and I think I found something we\u2019ll enjoy watching even more.\nAmy: What is it?\nPenny: Oh, just a video of Bernadette in a beauty pageant.\nAmy: What?\nBernadette: Okay, I learned my lesson. Making fun of people is wrong.\nAmy: I haven\u2019t learned my lesson. Play it. Play it.\nBernadette (on screen): Hi. I\u2019m Bernadette Maryann Rostenkowski from Yorba Linda, California.\nPenny: You look like a talking cupcake.\nBernadette (on screen): And you should pick me for Miss California Quiznos 1999, because I want to (singing) tell you what I want, what I really really want, l tell you what I want, what I really really want, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna Really, really, really be Miss California Quiznos 1999.\nAmy: Play it again. Play it again.\nScene: The apartment. \nRaj: Did he respond yet?\nSheldon: Hmm. No, not yet.\nLeonard: Well, maybe we shouldn\u2019t have sunk to his level.\nHoward: It wasn\u2019t that bad.\nLeonard: Read it back one more time.\nSheldon: My good sir, we are neither crackpots nor wannabes. In fact, we are experts in our fields. And while you hide behind your anonymity, we stand behind our paper. And later tonight, your mother.\nLeonard: And you don\u2019t think that\u2019s too rough?\nSheldon: We\u2019re just standing behind her. It\u2019s not like we\u2019re gonna say boo and scare her.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment. \nPenny: How could you not tell us you were in beauty pageants?\nBernadette: \u2018Cause it\u2019s embarrassing.\nPenny: It is; it truly is.\nBernadette: Yeah, well, Amy writes Little House on the Prairie fan fiction about herself and posts it on the Internet.\nPenny: No.\nAmy: Why? What did I do?\nBernadette: Sorry, I had to get the spotlight off me, and tearing down other women is part of my pageant training.\nPenny: Okay. We are reading that right now.\nAmy: No, please don\u2019t.\nBernadette: We got embarrassed tonight. Come on.\nAmy: But it\u2019s personal.\nPenny: Why? Is it about you and Sheldon?\nAmy: No.\nPenny: Oh, my God, it\u2019s about her and Sheldon.\nAmy: It\u2019s not about me and Sheldon. It\u2019s about a young woman in the 1800s named Amelia, and the time-traveling physicist named Cooper she falls in love with.\nPenny: Please show us?\nBernadette: Please?\nAmy: No.\nPenny: You know I\u2019m gonna read it either way.\nAmy: Good luck finding it.\nPenny: Amelia and the time-trav\u2026 found it. It was just past dawn on the prairie, and like every morning, Amelia prepared to do her chores. Except something about this morning felt different.\nBernadette: Why? Why did it feel different?\nPenny: Maybe it was the first whisper of winter in the air, or maybe it was the unconscious handsome man with porcelain skin and curious clothing she was about to discover lying in the field. A man who would open her mind to new possibilities and her body to new feelings.\nAmy: You know, there was a time when I was alone and had no friends. I\u2019m starting to miss that.\nScene: The apartment. \nSheldon: He still hasn\u2019t responded. What\u2019s taking him so long?\nLeonard: Do you really want him to write back?\nSheldon: Yeah, I do. Then no matter how he responds, I am going to destroy him with a picture of a bored cat saying oh, really?\nLeonard: Me-wow.\nHoward: What are you doing?\nRaj: I\u2019ve, uh, created some other user accounts so I can post positive comments about their paper.\nHoward: This wee li\u2019l bairn of a theory nearly blew my kilt off.\nRaj: No. You have to read it how Dr. Angus McDougal of the University of Edinburgh would. This wee li\u2019l bairn of a theory nearly blew me kilt off.\nSheldon: He wrote back. Cooper and Hofstadter resorting to juvenile attempts at humour is proof they have nothing to back up their ridiculous paper. It should come as no surprise given they work at Cal Tech, essentially a technical school, where even the physicists are basically engineers. Engineers? Do you know how insulting that is?\nHoward: Yes.\nRaj: Guys, this person\u2019s just going out of their way to get a rise out of you.\nSheldon: Yeah, but it\u2019s still so aggravating.\nRaj: Yeah, well, all the other comments said really nice things. Focus on those.\nHoward: Yeah. Dr. Dmitri Plancovik of Moscow University said dis paper great, I love it more than wodka.\nRaj: See? Better with the accent.\nSheldon: And send.\nLeonard: What did you write?\nSheldon: I\u2019m done hiding from bullies. I\u2019m taking this into the real world.\nLeonard: What does that mean?\nSheldon: I told him we\u2019ll meet him face-to-face anytime, anywhere.\nLeonard: Are you crazy? You don\u2019t know who this person is. Delete that.\nRaj: Come on, Sheldon!\nSheldon: Oh, okay, okay, calm down. (Skype tone) It\u2019s him. He\u2019s trying to video chat. Perhaps I shouldn\u2019t have taken this into the real world.\nLeonard: Oh, really?\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment. \nPenny: \u201cTime travel? I don\u2019t understand,\u201d said Amelia. Cooper stared at her. \u2018Which word don\u2019t you understand, time or travel?\u201d\nBernadette: Wow, even in your fantasies Sheldon\u2019s kind of exhausting.\nAmy: He\u2019s like that in the beginning, so she can change him. It\u2019s called good writing. And wishful thinking.\nPenny: It stung Amelia when he spoke to her this way. In her little one-room schoolhouse, she was always the smartest student, regularly besting the boys in her class, but this was no boy in front of her, this was a man.\nBernadette: Here we go.\nPenny: Cooper told Amelia about all the strange and incredible things the future would hold, like computers and living past 30. He asked her if she had any questions. All she longed to ask was if his heart was beating as fast as hers, but she was too afraid to hear the answer.\nBernadette: Oh, Amelia.\nPenny: So instead she asked if, in the future, Montana ever became a state.\nAmy: In the 1800s that was considered flirting.\nScene: The apartment. \nRaj: I\u2019m so sick of people being mean on the Internet.\nHoward: Well, I think the anonymity makes everyone feel like they can say things they\u2019d never say to your face.\nSheldon: Interesting. I can\u2019t think of a single thing I wouldn\u2019t say to someone\u2019s face.\nLeonard: Never noticed that about you.\nRaj: You know what? At least you guys did something. You know, you, you had a theory, you wrote a paper, you made an actual contribution. All guys like this do is just stand on other people\u2019s work.\nSheldon: He\u2019s right. I say we call this person back. We\u2019ve got no reason to hide.\nLeonard: All right, do it. Call him. Let\u2019s find out what this loser\u2019s ever accomplished.\nSheldon: Click it with me. One, two, three, click.\nStephen Hawking: Well, hello there.\nSheldon: Professor Hawking?\nStephen Hawking: Oh, brother, you should see the look on your faces.\nLeonard: You really didn\u2019t like our paper?\nStephen Hawking: I like your paper very much. The premise is intriguing.\nSheldon: Then why are you attacking us?\nStephen Hawking: If you were sitting in a chair for 40 years, you\u2019d get bored, too. Anyway, got to go. I promised to help the neighbour kid with his maths homework. Ciao.\nLeonard: Stephen Hawking liked our paper. Said the premise is intriguing.\nSheldon: Good to see you again, Mr. Stephen-Hawking Liked-Our-Paper.\nLeonard: And you as well, Mr. Our-Premise-Is-Intriguing.\nHoward: How do you do, Mr. I\u2019ll-Admit-That\u2019s-Pretty-Cool?\nRaj: Yeah, you keep setting me up for failure.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment. \nPenny: With a heavy heart, Amelia stood before the newly repaired time machine. She regretted giving Cooper the part he needed.\nBernadette: Because she wanted him to give her the part she needed.\nAmy: Okay, that\u2019s enough.\nPenny: What? No, I really want to know what happens, and Bernadette really, really, really wants to know what happens.\nAmy: You\u2019re just making fun of me.\nBernadette: I was just kidding. I\u2019m sorry. And the story\u2019s really good.\nPenny: No, it is. Does he stay? Do they kiss? Does she find out about Montana?\nBernadette: Please?\nAmy: Fine. As Cooper prepared to depart, tears filled Amelia\u2019s eyes. He took her hand in his and said, \u201cI can\u2019t stay, but I will never forget you.\u201d He brushed his fingers against her cheek, then quickly stepped into the machine. \u201cPlease don\u2019t go,\u201d she whispered. But it was too late. The engine hummed to life.\nBernadette: But they didn\u2019t even kiss.\nAmy: She turned away, wiping her eyes. She couldn\u2019t bear to watch her one chance at true love disappear forever. Then she felt a strong hand on her shoulder spin her around. It was Cooper.\nPenny: Yes.\nAmy: \u201cWhat about the future?\u201d asked Amelia. He looked deeply into her eyes and whispered, \u201cThere is no future without you.\u201d He pulled her in close. She began to tremble all over. She felt his warm breath\u2026\nLeonard: You will not believe what Stephen Hawking just said.\nPenny: Get out!\nBernadette: Not now!\nScene: An 1800\u2019s house. \nAmelia: Is the water warm enough?\nCooper: Given the fact that you took the time to build a wood fire, draw the water from the well and heat it, it would be rude to complain. But since you asked, it\u2019s a little nippy.\nAmelia: I can fix that. I couldn\u2019t help but notice your unusual undergarments.\nCooper: They\u2019re not undergarments. They\u2019re Underoos. Where I come from, they\u2019re known as underwear that\u2019s fun to wear.\nAmelia: And what\u2019s the significance of the spider?\nCooper: Oh, that represents Spider-Man. He does whatever a spider can.\nAmelia: There\u2019s a lot of rhyming in the future, isn\u2019t there?\nLeonard (in bed): You\u2019re right. This is even weirder than I thought.\nPenny: You want me to stop reading?\nLeonard: Are you kidding? No, no.\nPenny: As he stood for Amelia to dry him\u2026\nAmelia: So, tell me, Cooper, are the ways of physical love different in the future?\nLeonard: Yeah, okay, I\u2019m good.\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "5_17": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: A corridor at the university\nRaj: It was a nice retirement party.\nHoward: I guess. Still, it\u2019s a shame Professor Rothman was forced to step down.\nLeonard: What choice did the university have? He snapped. It happens to theoretical physicists all the time.\nHoward: I wonder how long Sheldon\u2019s got.\nSheldon: These shrimp are all the same size. There\u2019s no the logical order to eat them in.\nLeonard: Can\u2019t be very long.\nRaj: Hey, look, there\u2019s Rothman\u2019s empty office. Sad.\nLeonard: Yeah.\nSheldon: Mm, indeed.\nHoward: So sad.\nSheldon: Dibs.\nKripke: What\u2019s up, fewwas?\nSheldon: What are you doing here, Kripke?\nKripke: Ah, measuwing my new office for dwapes.\nSheldon: This is not your office. It hasn\u2019t been assigned yet.\nKripke: Well, I called dibs at the Chwistmas party when Pwofessor Wothman twied to have intercourse with the toys for tots cowwection box.\nSheldon: Dibs? This is a university, not a playground. Offices are not assigned because someone called dibs.\nLeonard: You just called dibs.\nSheldon: Shut it. Offices are assigned by seniority. I arrived at the university first.\nKripke: I awwived at the office first. I\u2019m the pwoverbial earwy bird.\nRothman (entering, naked): Gentlemen.\nAll: Professor Rothman.\nRothman: Good evening.\nAll: Good evening.\nRaj: I\u2019m glad that men are wearing hats again. They\u2019re so distinguished.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment.\nAmy: I got you a little something.\nPenny: A little something? Oh, it\u2026 what, this is huge.\nAmy: What\u2019s huge is what you\u2019ve done for me.\nPenny: Oh, no, Amy, I haven\u2019t done anything.\nAmy: No, no, before I met you, I was a mousy wallflower. But look at me now. I\u2019m like some kind of downtown hipster party girl. With a posse, a boyfriend and a new lace bra that hooks in the front, of all things. Open it. Open it.\nPenny: Okay. (Opens parcel to find a huge and not at all flattering painting of Penny and Amy)\nAmy: I wanted to get you something you didn\u2019t have.\nPenny: Wow. I-I don\u2019t know what to s\u2026 Wow.\nAmy: Do you like it?\nPenny: Do I like it? Wow.\nAmy: So, uh, where are you gonna hang it?\nPenny: Oh, my God. Hang it. Wow. Um, you know, I\u2019d have to go get a hook and nails and a hammer and\u2026\nAmy: No problem.\nPenny: Oh, look. You, huh, you just, you got it all right there. Wow.\nScene: A bathroom at the university.\nSheldon: I found him. He\u2019s in the bathroom. President Siebert?\nSiebert: Can\u2019t this wait?\nSheldon: I\u2019m sorry. We just need a word.\nSiebert: Now? You realize I\u2019m your boss, and I am holding my penis?\nKripke: Sheldon, give the man some pwivacy. I\u2019m sowwy. This guy\u2019s got no wespect for boundawies.\nSiebert: What do you want?\nKripke: Will you tell this wunatic that Pwofessor Wothman\u2019s office is wightfully mine?\nSiebert: Can\u2019t you take this up with your department chairman?\nSheldon: We tried. His assistant said he was on sabbatical. Although we distinctly heard his office window open and shut.\nSiebert: Gentlemen, there\u2019s a task I\u2019m trying to accomplish here, and I\u2019m having trouble doing it.\nSheldon: Oh, my. President Siebert, I don\u2019t mean to be an alarmist, but difficulty initiating a urine stream could be a symptom of benign prostatic hyperplasia. If you\u2019re interested, I can send you a link to a YouTube video that\u2019ll show you how to perform your own rectal exam. Yeah, uh, helpful hint, trim your nails first.\nKripke: Ignore him, Pwesident Siebert. I\u2019m sure a young man such as yourself has a perfectwy healthy pwostate.\nSheldon: Oh, he\u2019s just trying to butter you up. And for the record, butter is an excellent lubricant for your rectal exam.\nSiebert: Gentlemen, I\u2019m going to allow the two of you to work this out because A, you\u2019re both brilliant scientists, and B, as far as who gets Rothman\u2019s office, I couldn\u2019t give the furry crack of a rat\u2019s behind.\nKripke: Well, as wong as we\u2019re here, I might as well take a weak.\nSheldon: Kripke?\nKripke: Yes?\nSheldon: You\u2019re in my spot.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment.\nBernadette: That is big.\nPenny: So big.\nBernadette: And ugly.\nPenny: So ugly. What am I gonna do?\nBernadette: I don\u2019t know. You can\u2019t take it down. You\u2019ll break her heart. Look at that face. That enormous, unsettling, crazy face.\nPenny: Is there any chance I\u2019ll learn to love it?\nBernadette: That depends. Do you like pictures of yourself where you look like a man?\nPenny: All right, it\u2019s got to go.\nBernadette: What will you tell Amy?\nPenny: How about I tell her the painting makes you feel jealous because you\u2019re not in it?\nBernadette: Nuh-uh. What if she gets me one? I already have a picture of me and Howard\u2019s mom getting our hair cornrowed in Venice Beach. I\u2019ve suffered enough.\nPenny: Well, I guess I could take it down and put it up when she comes over, but it\u2019s kind of heavy.\nBernadette: Mmm, too bad you\u2019re not as strong as the dude in the painting.\nScene: The apartment.\nRaj: Would you look at this? I paid twenty five dollars to some kid on eBay for a handcrafted Harry Potter wand. He sent me a stick. He went into his backyard, he picked up a stick.\nHoward: It\u2019s numbered.\nRaj: Ooh, limited edition. Nice.\nSheldon (knock on door): Oh, that\u2019ll be Kripke.\nLeonard: What\u2019s he doing here?\nSheldon: We\u2019re going to work this office situation out like gentlemen. And if that doesn\u2019t work, I\u2019m going to poison his tea.\nKripke: Cooper.\nSheldon: Kripke. Come in. I\u2019m making tea. Would you like a cup?\nKripke: Am I weawing a summer fwock? No, I don\u2019t want tea. Wet\u2019s get down to bwass tacks.\nSheldon: Fine. In the interest of preserving our friendship\u2026\nKripke: We\u2019re not fwiends.\nSheldon: Well, that\u2019s a little hard to hear, but all right. As you know, the essence of diplomacy is compromise. With that in mind, I propose the following. I will take Rothman\u2019s office, and you will find a way to be okay with that.\nKripke: How about I take Wothman\u2019s office, and you go suck a wemon?\nSheldon: You sure I can\u2019t get you that cup of tea?\nRaj: How about you decide this with Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock?\nKripke: What the fwig is that?\nSheldon: Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock was created by Internet pioneer Sam Kass as an improvement on the classic game Rock-Paper-Scissors. All hail Sam Kass.\nAll: Hail.\nKripke: How does it work?\nSheldon: Oh, it\u2019s very simple. Scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock, rock crushes lizard, lizard poisons Spock, Spock smashes scissors, scissors decapitates lizard, lizard eats paper, paper disproves Spock, Spock vaporizes rock, and as it always has, rock crushes scissors.\nKripke: I\u2019m sowwy. Can you wepeat that?\nSheldon: Well, of course. Scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock, rock crushes lizard, lizard poisons Spock, Spock smashes scissors, scissors decapitates lizard, lizard eats paper, paper disproves Spock, Spock vaporizes rock, and as it always has, rock crushes scissors.\nKripke: Almost got it. One more time.\nSheldon: Surely. Scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock, rock\u2026\nHoward: Sheldon, stop. He\u2019s screwing with you.\nSheldon: Is he? Well, then, it seems we have reached an impasse. I see no other option than to challenge you to a duel. I\u2019d smack you with a glove, but just last week I packed away my winter things.\nHoward: It\u2019s the 21st century. You can\u2019t have a duel.\nLeonard: H-h-h-hang on, Howard. Barry, how good of a shot are you?\nSheldon: Not pistols. Minds. A trivia contest, and you may choose the field of battle. Star Trek trivia, Star Trek: Next Generation trivia, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine trivia, Star Trek: Voyager trivia, or model trains.\nKripke: You have a compwete advantage in twivia. You have an eidetic memowy. Pwus, I haven\u2019t watched Star Twek since I discovered the stwip cwub near my apartment has a fwee buffet.\nLeonard: It\u2019s gonna be hard to find something you\u2019re both equally good at.\nRaj: Is there anything you\u2019re both equally bad at?\nBoth: Sports.\nScene: A basketball court.\nLeonard: All right, this is one-on-one. First person to five wins the office. Any questions? Yes, Sheldon?\nSheldon: Five what?\nLeonard: Balls in the basket. (Throws ball to Sheldon)\nSheldon (dodging out of the way): Ew!\nLater. Sheldon dribbling ball, approached Kripke, throws it wildly at a pile of mats in the corner.\nKripke: It\u2019s out, wight?\nLater. Kripke, dribbling ball, watched by Sheldon, dribbles it all the way into the back wall.\nKripke: Time. Wan out of woom.\nLeonard: You know all those terrible things bullies used to do to us?\nRaj: Yeah.\nLeonard: I get it.\nLater. Kripke chases ball across room chased by Sheldon. Sounds of collision. Sheldon chases ball back across the room chased by Kripke.\nLater. Ball hits Sheldon in back of head.\nSheldon: Hey! He did that on purpose,\nLeonard: No, he didn\u2019t. Nothing that\u2019s happening here is being done on purpose. Okay, uh, forget one-on-one. Let\u2019s try a free throw contest. First person who makes a basket wins the office.\nKripke: Making it too easy there, Hofstadter.\nLeonard: No. No, I\u2019m not.\nSheldon: Use the force, Sheldon. Use the force. (Throws ball. It goes about two feet in front of him.) I\u2019m gonna need more force.\nKripke: Aw wight, Cooper, pwepare to have your heart bwoken. (Throws ball up. It hits the ceiling and doesn\u2019t come down.) Do I get points for that?\nLater. A trampoline has been added. Sheldon tries first, ball hits backboard, bounces back in his face. Kripke tries next, with a run up, ends up crashing into the back wall again.\nLater.\nLeonard: All right, we gave it 45 minutes. It\u2019s no longer funny. Let\u2019s try something else.\nSheldon: What do you propose?\nLeonard: Uh, on the count of three, both of you bounce the balls as hard as you can. The highest bounce wins the office.\nKripke: Oh, you are going down, Cooper.\nSheldon: I don\u2019t think so, Kripke. I\u2019ve bounced many a rubber ball in my day.\nLeonard: All right, that\u2019s enough trash talk. One, two, three.\nHoward: Sheldon was higher.\nLeonard: Congratulations, Sheldon. You win office.\nSheldon: Who\u2019s unsatisfactory in P.E. now?\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment.\nAmy: Oh, what a great movie.\nPenny: I cannot believe you\u2019ve never seen Grease.\nAmy: My mother didn\u2019t allow me to watch it. She was afraid it might encourage me to join a gang.\nBernadette: I\u2019ve got to go. I\u2019ve got to get up early. My company\u2019s testing a new steroid that supposedly doesn\u2019t shrink testicles, and the last one there has to do the measuring.\nAmy: I guess I should get going, too. Good night, painting Penny. Good night, real Penny.\nPenny: Good night, real Amy.\nAmy: You don\u2019t have to say good night to painting Amy, \u2019cause she\u2019s never leaving.\nBernadette: Good night, real Penny.\nPenny: Bye.\nBernadette: Good night, transvestite Penny.\nPenny: Ah, okay. Let us take you off the wall. Out of sight, out of mind. I wish.\nAmy (entering): You know, can I borrow that movie? Those singing hooligans really got my motor running.\nPenny: Sure, sure. Enjoy. I mean, get it back to me when you can, or, you know what, actually, you keep it. It\u2019s just going to be my gift to you. Bye.\nAmy: Thank you. Wait. Where\u2019d the painting go?\nPenny: It\u2019s right over there.\nAmy: Why?\nPenny: I have no idea. That is weird.\nAmy: You hate it.\nPenny: No. No, no. It\u2019s just, it\u2019s a little big.\nAmy: I feel like an idiot.\nPenny: No, come on, you\u2019re not an idiot. Look, just help me put it back up.\nAmy: Why? So you can just take it down when I leave? I don\u2019t need your pity.\nPenny: Oh, Amy, come on.\nAmy: I\u2019m just glad I didn\u2019t go for the sculpture.\nScene: Rothman\u2019s office.\nSheldon: Ah, the spoils. I see why victors love them.\nRaj: I\u2019m happy for you, Sheldon. But I have to admit I\u2019m going to miss sharing an office with you.\nSheldon: Oh, of course you are. Feel free to drop by any time.\nRaj: Thank you.\nSheldon: Yeah. Call first. (Pushes him out. Closes door. Rothman is standing naked behind it.)\nRothman: Oh. Hello.\nSheldon: Professor Rothman. This isn\u2019t your office any more. You\u2019re retired.\nRothman: I think the word you\u2019re looking for is invisible.\nScene: Amy\u2019s apartment.\nPenny: I came to say I\u2019m sorry.\nAmy: Don\u2019t bother.\nPenny: Oh, Amy, please.\nAmy: I\u2019m so humiliated. I sat there the whole time that we were watching Grease, thinking you liked the painting.\nPenny: I know.\nAmy: I was a fool from Summer Lovin\u2019 to the very last rama lama lama ke ding a de dinga a dong.\nPenny: You\u2019re right. You\u2019re absolutely right. I should have been honest with you and told you the gift was too much.\nAmy: Yes, too much. Because our friendship is fundamentally asymmetrical. I clearly like you more than you like me.\nPenny: I don\u2019t think you can put a number on how much one person likes another.\nAmy: I bought you a painting that\u2019s 12 square feet in area. There\u2019s a number.\nPenny: Amy, come on\u2026\nAmy: If you don\u2019t like feet, you can try dollars. The painting set me back three grand.\nPenny: Three gr\u2026 Oh, my God! Look, look, Amy, all you need to know is, you are my friend and I don\u2019t want to lose you out of my life.\nAmy: I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m just having trouble believing you right now.\nPenny: Grab your hammer.\nAmy: No. Damage is done.\nPenny: Okay, look, I didn\u2019t want to say this, but the real reason I took the painting down was because it made Bernadette very jealous.\nAmy: Oh, my goodness, how could I have not seen that? The painting is a constant reminder that of the three of us, she is the least cool.\nPenny: Yeah, th-th-th-that\u2019s what it is, so\u2026\nAmy: You have such a good heart.\nPenny: Huh, I try.\nAmy: Come on.\nPenny: Well where are we going?\nAmy: We\u2019re going to go put this painting back up in your apartment.\nPenny: Well, what about Bernadette?\nAmy: Oh, screw her. She\u2019s just lucky we let her hang out with us.\nScene: Rothman\u2019s office. Sheldon is trying to affix paper over a fiercely blowing air vent.\nLeonard: What are you doing?\nSheldon: I\u2019m trying to raise the temperature in here before my nipples tear through my shirt.\nHoward: Why don\u2019t you just turn up the thermostat?\nSheldon: Aha! Good question. It turns out the thermostat for my new office isn\u2019t in my new office. No. It\u2019s next door, in Professor Davenport\u2019s office, who is currently enjoying the hot flashes associated with menopause.\nLeonard: Why is there a hole here?\nSheldon: Why is there a hole in my new office? I\u2019ve narrowed it down to two possibilities: There was something in the wall that someone outside the wall wanted, or the more disturbing, there was something in the wall that wanted out.\nRaj: Well, at least you finally got a window that opens. That\u2019s nice.\nSheldon: Is it? Listen.\nRaj: What, you don\u2019t like wind chimes?\nSheldon: No, I hate them, but it gets worse. There it is.\nHoward: The bird?\nSheldon: Yeah, It\u2019s completely out of tune with the wind chimes.\nRaj: So?\nSheldon: You don\u2019t get it, do you? That\u2019s a mockingbird. Mockingbirds can change their song, which means he\u2019s out of tune on purpose. He\u2019s mocking me. Oh dear. There it is again. Do you feel it?\nHoward: The growing realization that you are one wacky bastard? Yep.\nSheldon: No. The vibration. We are directly underneath the geology lab, and they\u2019re running their confounded sieve shakers again. Hey, gravel monkeys, if you need to shake rocks, try jiggling your heads around!\nLeonard: Sheldon, relax.\nSheldon: How can I relax? My nervous system is being stretched out like the strings of a harp and plucked by holes and birds and wind and the low-hanging scrotum of the difficult-to-evict Professor Rothman.\nLeonard: If you\u2019re not happy, why don\u2019t you just let Kripke have the office?\nSheldon: What, and let him win? Do I look crazy to you? We\u2019re trying to think down here, you geode-loving feldspar jockeys! (To the bird) And you, the notes are C, D, E, G and A. You pick one or I am chopping down that tree!\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment.\nPenny: How\u2019s that?\nAmy: Little higher on the right.\nPenny: Now?\nAmy: Little more. No. That\u2019s got it.\nPenny: Yeah, okay. That\u2019s, uh, that\u2019s good.\nAmy: I\u2019ll let you in on a little secret.\nPenny: Mm.\nAmy: Originally we were painted nude. But I had him add clothes, \u2019cause I thought it was an unnecessary challenge to our heterosexuality.\nPenny: Yeah, good call.\nAmy: But if you ever change your mind, all it would take is some warm, soapy water and a couple of sponges.\nPenny: You\u2019re talking about the painting, right?\nAmy: Sure.\nScene: Rothman\u2019s office. Sheldon has his head stuck in the hole in the wall.\nSheldon: Help! Somebody help!\nLeonard: What happened?\nSheldon: I was trying to see what was in here and my head got stuck.\nLeonard: Why would you do that?\nSheldon: It\u2019s called scientific curiosity. Now go get butter.\nLeonard: Hang in there. I\u2019ll be right back. (Takes out phone and takes a photo.

I mean the e-mail doesn\u2019t bother me as much as the vacation pictures of him in a bathing suit.\nLeonard: Yeah, I got the same one. And that\u2019s not a bathing suit, it\u2019s a tan line.\nSheldon (on phone): Hello. This is Sheldon Cooper. I\u2019m leaving a message for Barry Kripke. Barry, It was pleasant seeing you today in the cafeteria. I saw that you purchased the chef\u2019s salad. Apparently, you did not know that the chef\u2019s salad is kitchen trickery, to utilize scrap meat. Nevertheless, I hope you enjoyed it. I\u2019m following up on our pending friendship, and I look forward to hearing from you regarding its status. Sheldon Cooper.\nPenny: What\u2019s up with Ichabod?\nLeonard: Oh he\u2019s trying to make a new friend.\nPenny: Oh really? Well, good for him.\nLeonard: Well, unless he\u2019s makes one out of wood like Gepetto, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s gonna happen.\nPenny: Well, how did you guys become friends?\nLeonard: There was a flier on the bulletin board at the university. Roommate wanted. Whistlers need not apply.\nPenny: And you moved in anyway?\nLeonard: I assumed he was joking. You\u2019d be surprised how many particle physicists have a whimsical side.\nPenny: Well, what about Howard and Raj, I mean how did you become friends with them?\nLeonard: I don\u2019t know, how do carbon atoms form a benzene ring? Proximity and valence electrons.\nPenny: Well yeah, sure. When you put it that way. But it all worked out, right?\nLeonard: I suppose. I do miss whistling though.\nPenny: Oh come on, really? (Leonard whistles)\nSheldon: First warning.\nScene: Outside Penny\u2019s door.\n\u00a0\nSheldon (Knock, knock, knock) : Penny (knock, knock, knock)  Penny (knock, knock, knock)  Penny.This is for you.\nPenny: Hello Sheldon.\nSheldon: Hi.\nPenny: What is this?\nSheldon: It\u2019s a questionnaire I devised. I\u2019m having some difficulty bonding with a colleague at work, so I\u2019m doing a little research to better understand why my current friends like me.\nPenny: Yes. Well, that is a good question. But is this really the best way to figure it out?\nSheldon: Yeah, I agree, the social sciences are largely hokum. But, short of putting electrodes in your brain and monitoring your response to my companionship, this is the best I can do.\nPenny: Okay, question 1. Rank the following aspects of Sheldon Cooper in order of appeal. Intelligence. Ruthless attention to hygiene. Playfulness. Java applet writing?\nSheldon: I know, I may have started off with a fairly obvious one. You did an aspect of my most appealing trait, playfulness. Why don\u2019t you just go ahead and write that number 1. I\u2019m afraid you\u2019re on your own for the rest. It should take you no more than 3 hours.\nPenny: Wait! How many questions are on this thing?\nSheldon: Only 211. Don\u2019t worry, in deference to you, I\u2019ve kept them on a high school graduate reading level.\nPenny: Thanks pal.\nSheldon: You got it, buddy.\nPenny: Sheldon honey, did you ever consider making friends by being, I don\u2019t know, pleasant?\nSheldon: Well that\u2019s certainly a thought-provoking hypothesis. May I suggest it as the topic for your essay.\nScene: The apartment. Sheldon is reading one of the questionnaires. He tuts.\nSheldon: Your questionnaire, very disappointing.\nLeonard: I answered every question Sheldon.\nSheldon: You answered the multiple choice questions in a pattern. A B B A C. A B B A C.\nLeonard: Aw, you picked up on that huh?\nSheldon: How could I not?\nLeonard: Come on! There\u2019s over 200 questions. And look at some of these things. Sheldon is to camaraderie, as the space shuttle is to blank?\nSheldon: There are a number of acceptable answers, for example, C: near earth transport, but certainly not B: avocado rancher. And your essay, suggesting that I\u2019d have better luck making friends if I wait \u2019til the Cylons take over? Please.\nLeonard: Hold on. I put some real work into that!\nSheldon: Yes, well it\u2019s better than what Wolowitz did. He drew a raccoon with what appears to be, a distended scrotum.\nLeonard: It\u2019s kinda cute, until you get to the scrotum.\nSheldon: What hope do I have for establishing new relationships given that my current friends apparently cannot take a few hours out of their lives to help me?\nLeonard: Sheldon, I\u2019m not going to defend a big-balled raccoon.\nSheldon: I don\u2019t see how you could.\nLeonard: What I\u2019m trying to say is that, maybe you can\u2019t approach this as a purely intellectual exercise.\nSheldon: What do you mean!?\nLeonard: Well, remember when you tried to learn how to swim using the internet?\nSheldon: I did learn how to swim.\nLeonard: On the floor.\nSheldon: The skills are transferrable. I just have no interest in going in the water.\nLeonard: Then why learn how to swim?\nSheldon: The ice caps are melting Leonard. In the future, swimming isn\u2019t going to be optional. But you do bring up an interesting point. I don\u2019t have to break new ground here, I\u2019m sure much of the research already exists.\nLeonard: No! no, my point is, if you want to learn how to make friends, then just go out to a coffee shop or a museum. Meet people. Talk to them. Take an interest in their lives.\nSheldon: That\u2019s insane on the face of it. Come on.\nLeonard: Where are we going?\nSheldon: You\u2019re driving me to the mall. I\u2019m going to acquire a book that summarizes the current theories in the field of friendmaking.\nLeonard: Why don\u2019t you just lie down on the floor and swim there?\nScene: A bookshop.\n\u00a0\nSheldon: Coping with the death of a loved one. My condolences.\nWoman in queue: Thank you.\nSheldon: Family or friend?\nWoman: Family.\nSheldon: Too bad. If it\u2019d been a friend, I\u2019m available to fill the void. (Woman moves away) It\u2019s just as well, she smelled like moth balls.\nLeonard: Okay, if you\u2019re gonna start sniffing people, I\u2019m gonna go get a hot pretzel.\nSheldon: Excuse me. Do you have any books about making friends?\nBookstore employee: Um, yeah but they\u2019re all for little kids.\nSheldon: I assume the skills can be extrapolated and transferred.\nEmployee: Uh, I guess. They\u2019re right over there by the wooden train set.\nSheldon: Oh! I love trains!\nEmployee: I bet you do.\nSheldon (picks up train): Oh my! That\u2019s awfully sticky. Alright, let\u2019s see. Bernie Bunny has Two Daddies Now. It\u2019s probably about homosexual rabbits. Jerry the Gerbil and the Bullies on the Bus. Read it, not helpful. Oh! Here we go. Stu the Cockatoo is New at the Zoo. Author Sarah Carpenter lives in Fort Wayne, Indiana, with her husband and best friend Mark, and their cockatoos too. Hardly makes her an expert in making friends, wouldn\u2019t you agree?\nLittle girl: I don\u2019t like birds, they scare me.\nSheldon: Me too! Most people don\u2019t see it. What are you reading?\nGirl: Curious George.\nSheldon: Oh I do like monkeys!\nGirl: Curious George is a monkey.\nSheldon: Somewhat anthropomorphized but yes. Say, maybe sometime you and I can go see monkeys together. Would you like that?\nGirl: Okay.\nLeonard: Sheldon, what are you doing?\nSheldon: I\u2019m making friends with this little girl. What\u2019s your name?\nGirl: Rebecca.\nSheldon: Hi Rebecca, I\u2019m your new friend, Sheldon.\nLeonard: No you\u2019re not, let\u2019s go.\nSheldon: We were really hitting it off.\nLeonard: Don\u2019t look up, there\u2019s cameras.\nScene: The stairwell.\nRaj: I\u2019m curious. In the \u201cHow Well Do You Know Sheldon\u201d section, what do you put for his favourite amino acid?\nLeonard and Howard: Lysine.\nRaj: Damn it. I had Lysine and changed it.\nSheldon: Oh good! You\u2019re just in time. I believe I\u2019ve isolated the algorithm for making friends.\nLeonard: Sheldon, there is no algorithm for making friends!\nHoward: Hear him out. If he\u2019s really on to something, we can open a booth at Comic-Con, make a fortune.\nSheldon: See, my initial approach to Kripke, had the same deficiencies as those that plagued Stu the Cockatoo, when he was new at the zoo.\nRaj: Stu the cockatoo?\nLeonard: Yes, he\u2019s new at the zoo.\nSheldon: It\u2019s a terrific book. I\u2019ve distilled its essence into a simple flowchart that would guide me through the process.\nHoward: Have you thought about putting him in a crate while you\u2019re out of the apartment?\nSheldon (on phone): Hello, Kripke. Yes, Sheldon Cooper here. It occurred to me you hadn\u2019t returned any of my calls because I hadn\u2019t offered any concrete suggestions for pursuing our friendship. Perhaps the two of us might share a meal together\u2026 I see. Well then perhaps you\u2019d have time for a hot beverage. Popular choices include tea, coffee, cocoa\u2026 I see. No, no, no, wait. Don\u2019t hang up yet. What about a recreational activity? I bet we share some common interests. Tell me an interest of yours. Really? On actual horses? Tell me another interest of yours. Oh no, I\u2019m sorry, I have no desire to get in the water until I absolutely have to. Tell me another interest of yours.\nLeonard: Uh-oh, he\u2019s stuck in an infinite loop.\nHoward: I can fix it.\nSheldon: Mmhmm. Mmhmm. It\u2019s interesting. But isn\u2019t ventriloquism, by definition, a solo activity? Yeah? Tell me another interest of yours. Hmmm. Is there any chance you like monkeys? What is wrong with you? Everybody likes monkeys. Hang on, Kripke. (Checking changes Howard has made to his flowchart) A loop counter? And an escape to the least objectionable activity! Howard, that\u2019s brilliant! I\u2019m surprised you saw that.\nHoward: Gee. Why can\u2019t Sheldon make friends?\nSheldon: Alright Kripke, that last interest strikes me as the least objectionable and I would like to propose that we do that together. Tomorrow. Yes, I\u2019ll pay. Alright, goodbye. Alright! Time to learn rock climbing.\nScene: Rock climbing centre. Sheldon and Kripke are watching someone descend the practice wall.\nSheldon: You know, I am a fan of ventriloquism. Maybe you, me and your dummy could go get a hot beverage. He could talk while you drink.\nKripke: Nope, I wanna climb some wocks.\nSheldon: This appears significantly more monolithic than it did on my laptop. No, one expects to see Hominids learning to use bones as weapeons.\nKripke: You afwaid of heights, Cooper?\nSheldon: Hardly. Fear of heights is illogical. Fear of falling, on the other hand, is prudent and evolutionary. What would you say is the minimum altitude I need to achieve to cement our new-found friendship?\nKripke: Come on, they have birthday parties here. Wittle kids climb this.\nSheldon: Little kid Hominids, perhaps. (To man who attaches him to ropes) Is this your entire job? Your parents must be so proud.\nKripke: Let\u2019s go, Cooper.\nSheldon: Coming, Kripke. Okay. Harness seems to be secure. Small amount of incontinence just now, but the website said that\u2019s to be expected. Hey, this isn\u2019t so bad. A bit like vertical swimming.\nKripke: Hey, look at you, Cooper. You\u2019re almost halfway to the top.\nSheldon: I am? I was wrong. It IS a fear of heights.\nKripke:You alwight there, Cooper?\nSheldon: Not really. I feel somewhat like an inverse tangent function that\u2019s approaching an asymptote.\nKripke: Are you saying you\u2019re stuck?\nSheldon: What part of an inverse tangent function approaching an asymptote did you not understand?\nKripke: Understood all that. I\u2019m not a mowon. Just keep going.\nSheldon: Yeah, I don\u2019t think I can.\nKripke: Well, then. Cwimb back down.\nSheldon: No, that doesn\u2019t seem any more likely.\nKripke: So what\u2019s the pwan, Cooper?\nSheldon: Well, it\u2019s not exactly a plan but I think I\u2019m going to pass out.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: I\u2019m sorry. Can we please just do it one more time?\nHoward: Okay. 1, 2, 1, 2, 3 and\u2026 (Leonard, Howard and Raj whistle \u201cSweet Georgia Brown\u201d together)\nLeonard: It\u2019s a little thing but you really do miss it.\nSheldon: Hello, everyone. I brought my new friend, Barry Kripke, home for dinner.\nTogether: Oh\u2026\nKripke: Hewo to you, too.\nLeonard: How was rock climbing?\nKripke: He passed out. Just hung there like a big sawami.\nSheldon: D-d-d! That\u2019s where I sit.\nKripke: Ooh, you have a special spot. What kind of wacko are you?\nHoward: How much time you got?\nLeonard: Want some Chinese food?\nKripke: Tewific. Got any dental fwoss?\nLeonard: In the bathroom.\nKripke: Be right back. I gotta fwoss the Indian food out of my teeth if I\u2019m gonna eat Chinese.\nPenny: Sheldon, are you okay?\nSheldon: Oh yes, I pass out all the time. But, it was worth it. I\u2019ve made substantial progress in bonding with Kripke, which brings me to an awkward moment.\nLeonard: What\u2019s that?\nSheldon: Maintaining five friendships promises to be a Herculean task. So, I\u2019m going to have to let one of you go.\nHoward: Me, me. Let it be me.\nSheldon: Leonard, you are my roommate, my source of transportation and you help me fold my sheets when they come out of the dryer. You are safe.\nLeonard: Can I whistle?\nSheldon: Don\u2019t be silly. Howard, you do not have a PhD, your cologne is an assault on the senses and you\u2019re not available for video games during the Jewish high holidays.\nHoward: Guilty as charged. I\u2019m out.\nSheldon: No. You, too, are safe.\nHoward: Oh come on. What do I have to do?\nPenny: Okay. You know what? I see where this is going. I\u2019m not one of you guys. I\u2019m not a scientist. So just\u2026\nSheldon: Penny, Penny, Penny. Everything you\u2019re saying is true, but please allow me to continue. Raj, you\u2019re out. The good question, while you do provide a certain cultural diversity to an otherwise homogenous group, your responses to the questionnaire were truly disturbing. How could you, for a moment, think that my favourite amino acid is Glutamine?\nLeonard: He had Lysine but changed it.\nSheldon: Yeah. Shoulda, woulda coulda, Raj.\nKripke: I like to fwoss before I eat, so my gum pockets are open for new food.\nPenny: Eww.\nKripke: Hewo. How did I walk past you? I\u2019m Bawy.\nPenny: Penny.\nKripke: Yeah, it\u2019s not a vewy hot name. I\u2019m gonna call your Woxanne. Ooh, pot stickers.\nHoward: Suddenly I\u2019m looking pretty good, huh?\nSheldon: So uh, Kripke, I was wondering if there\u2019s any chance you could get me some time on the open science grid computer.\nKripke: No.\nSheldon: No? But we\u2019re friends!\nKripke: I\u2019m sowy. No, my fwiend?\nSheldon: I\u2019m confused. I was given an understanding that you allow your friends time on the machine?\nKripke: No, that\u2019s wong. There\u2019s an official schedule. I have no contwol over it.\nSheldon: Oh. This entire endeavour seems to have been an exercise in futility. Raj, you\u2019re back in. He likes monkeys.\nScene: The climbing centre.\nHoward: You gotta give him credit for sticking with it.\nLeonard: I didn\u2019t think he had it in him.\nRaj: He almost made it to the top this time.\nSheldon is seen dangling from the ropes\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "3_18": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The university cafeteria.\nRaj: Okay in Avatar when they have sex in Pandora they hook up their ponytails, so we know their ponytails are like their junk.\nHoward: Yeah, so?\nRaj: So, when they ride horses and fly on the birds, they also use their ponytails.\nHoward: What\u2019s your point?\nRaj: My point is, if I were a horse or a bird, I\u2019d be very nervous around James Cameron.\nSheldon: It amazes me how you constantly obsess over fictional details when there are more important things in the real world to worry about. For example, why wasn\u2019t William Shatner in the new Star Trek movie?\nLeonard: Hey, Sheldon, I was up in the administration office, and I happened to overhear the name of the winner of this year\u2019s Chancellor\u2019s Award for Science.\nSheldon: And you want to rub my nose in the fact that my contributions are being overlooked again? I am the William Shatner of theoretical physics. All right, I\u2019ll play. What self-important, preening fraud are they honouring this year?\nLeonard: Oh, I\u2019m so glad you asked it like that. You.\nSheldon: I won?\nLeonard: You won.\nSheldon: I won! This is astonishing. Not that I won the award, no one deserves it more. Actually, I guess I misspoke. It\u2019s not astonishing, more like inevitable. I\u2019m not sure what to do first. Maybe I should call my mother. Wait! I know, I\u2019m going to conduct an interview with myself and post it online.\nRaj: Well, good for him.\nHoward: Yeah, the one thing the William Shatner of theoretical physics needed was an ego boost.\nCredits sequence\n \nScene: The apartment. The guys are watching Avatar in 3D. All are wearing 3D glasses except Raj.\nHoward: Didn\u2019t it look like that spear was going to go right through your skull?\nRaj: No.\nLeonard: Hey, you didn\u2019t want a Slurpee at 7-Eleven, you don\u2019t get glasses.\nSheldon (phone rings): Oh, that will be another congratulatory call for me. Uh, mute, please.\nHoward: Uh, hang on, flaming arrow.\nSheldon: Hello? Oh, Chancellor Morton, how are you, sir? Yes, I was expecting your call (aside) three years ago. I see. Wait. What happens if I choose not to give a speech? Uh-huh. And if I don\u2019t want to forfeit the award? Well, you\u2019ve got that tied up in a neat little bow. All right. Thank you. (Hangs up) Problem.\nLeonard: What?\nSheldon: They expect me to give a speech at the banquet. I can\u2019t give a speech.\nHoward: Well, no, you\u2019re mistaken. You give speeches all the time. What you can\u2019t do is shut up.\nRaj: Yeah, before the movie, you did 20 minutes on why guacamole turns brown. It turned brown while you were talking.\nSheldon: I am perfectly comfortable speaking to small groups. I cannot speak to large crowds.\nLeonard: What, to you, is a large crowd?\nSheldon: Any group big enough to trample me to death. General rule of thumb is 36 adults or 70 children.\nPenny: Sheldon, congratulations. Brought you cheesecake from work. You know, \u2019cause of your award, not because a busboy sneezed on it.\nSheldon: I\u2019m not accepting the award.\nPenny: Why not?\nHoward: Turns out the great Sheldon Cooper has stage fright.\nPenny: That\u2019s no reason to back out. You know, I once got a pretty big honour in high school, and I was terrified about appearing in front of a big crowd, but I went through with it, and you know what? The world looked pretty darn good sitting on a haystack in the back of a Ford F-150 as a member of the Corn Queen\u2019s court.\nSheldon: Thank you. Yeah, I\u2019ll bear that in mind if I\u2019m ever nominated for the Hillbilly Peace Prize.\nLeonard: Sheldon, you\u2019re being ridiculous.\nSheldon: Am I? Let me tell you a story.\nHoward: Where\u2019s 70 children when you need \u2018em?\nSheldon: I was 14 and graduating summa cum laude from college. Summa cum laude is Latin for with highest honours.\nPenny: I just love how you always skip over the part where no one asks.\nSheldon: I was valedictorian and expected to give an address. Even now, I can remember that moment when I walked up to the podium and looked out at the crowd. There must have been thousands of people. My heart started pounding in my chest. I began to hyperventilate. My vision became blurry, and before I knew it\u2026 oh, dear. (He faints.)\nPenny: Oh, my God.\nLeonard: Sheldon? Sheldon, are you okay?\nSheldon: Don\u2019t trample me.\nScene: The stairwell. Sheldon is on the phone.\nSheldon: Come on, Mother, you know why I can\u2019t accept the award. With all due respect, I don\u2019t think praying will help. No, I have not heard the song, Jesus, Take the Wheel. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, you don\u2019t need to start singing it. Yes, I\u2019ll buy it on the iTunes, Mother. Good-bye, Mother. (Enters apartment. The others are sitting as if waiting for him.) Hello.\nLeonard: Sit down, we want to talk to you.\nSheldon: Am I in trouble? Did my mother call you?\nPenny: Just sit.\nLeonard: We think we can help you with your stage fright.\nSheldon: Oh, I doubt that. I haven\u2019t figured out a way, and I\u2019m much smarter than all of you.\nPenny: Yes, but you\u2019re not smarter than all of us put together.\nSheldon: Oh, I\u2019m sorry, that is what I meant.\nPenny: Okay, your problem is, you\u2019re trying to do this all by yourself.\nLeonard: We can help you. We can be your team. Like, uh, Professor Xavier and his X-Men.\nSheldon: I do like the X-Men.\nPenny: Did I see X-Men?\nLeonard: Yeah, we watched it last week. You said you liked it.\nPenny: Oh. I say a lot of things, sweetie. So, how about it, Sheldon?\nSheldon: I don\u2019t know. If you\u2019re my X-Men, what are your powers?\nPenny: Okay. Well, I am going to take you shopping, get you a nice suit. Might give you more confidence.\nSheldon: That\u2019s not exactly a mutation that would get you into Xavier\u2019s School for Gifted Youngsters, but go on. Leonard?\nLeonard: I thought I could try to analyze you and get to the root of your anxiety.\nSheldon: What qualifies you to attempt to understand my mind?\nLeonard: My mother is a highly regarded psychiatrist, and I\u2019ve been in therapy ever since she accused me of breast-feeding co-dependently.\nHoward: Raj says he can teach you, what did you call it? I don\u2019t know, some Indian meditation crap.\nSheldon: I see. Well, I assume, since the rest of you have set the bar so low, you\u2019re saving the most impressive contribution for last. Go ahead, Howard. Dazzle me.\nHoward: My power is the ability to pretend like I give a damn about your piddly-ass problems. And that\u2019s 24-7, buddy.\nSheldon: And I appreciate the pretence.\nPenny: So, what do you say, Sheldon? Are we your X-Men?\nSheldon: No. The X-Men were named for the X in Charles Xavier. Since I am Sheldon Cooper, you will be my C-Men.\nHoward: Oh, that\u2019s not a good name.\nScene: The apartment. Raj is lighting candles. Indian music is playing.\nRaj: Okay, Sheldon. I\u2019m going to be leading you through a series of meditation exercises. These methods come from the ancient gurus of India and have helped me overcome my own fears.\nSheldon: And yet, you can\u2019t speak to women.\nRaj: True, but thanks to meditation, I am able to stay in the same room with them without urinating. Now, close your eyes.\nSheldon: Okay, but don\u2019t punch me.\nRaj: What?\nSheldon: When I was little, my sister would say to me, close your eyes, you\u2019ll get a surprise, and then she\u2019d punch me.\nRaj: I\u2019m not going to punch you.\nSheldon: That\u2019s what my sister used to say.\nRaj: Do you want to do this or not?\nSheldon: I\u2019m sorry. Proceed.\nRaj: All right. Imagine yourself in the one place you feel most at home. Where is that?\nSheldon: Sim City. More specifically, the Sim City I designed, Sheldonopolis.\nRaj: Okay, you\u2019re in Sheldonopolis.\nSheldon: Where exactly? Sheldon Square? Sheldon Towers? Sheldon Stadium, home of the Fighting Sheldons?\nRaj: Whatever you like.\nSheldon: I thought this was supposed to be a guided meditation.\nRaj: Fine. You\u2019re in Sheldon Square.\nSheldon: Really? This time of year? It\u2019s a bit nippy.\nRaj: Then, put on a sweater.\nSheldon: Suppose I could run downtown and pick up something at Shel-Mart.\nRaj: Yeah, whatever. Just go buy a sweater.\nSheldon: You know, the nice thing about Shel-Mart is I own it, so I get a 15% discount.\nRaj: You own the damn thing. Just take a freaking sweater!\nSheldon: Look, I didn\u2019t turn a profit last quarter by taking product off the shelves willy-nilly.\nRaj: All right. You\u2019ve paid for a sweater, and you\u2019re in Sheldon Square.\nSheldon: Hang on. It\u2019s a cardigan. I have to button it. Oh, no.\nRaj: What now?\nSheldon: A Godzilla-like monster is approaching the city. I have to get my people to safety. People of Sheldonopolis, this is your mayor. Follow me. If the children can\u2019t run, leave them behind. Oh, the simulated horror! (Sound of door slamming) Raj? Just as I suspected. Meditation is nothing but hokum.\nScene: A clothing store.\nSheldon: I question your premise. How is a new suit going to prevent me from passing out in front of a ballroom full of people?\nPenny: It\u2019ll give you confidence. You know, sometimes when I\u2019m feeling all stressed out about something, I go out and buy a cute top or a fun skirt and I have a whole new outlook on life.\nSheldon: Don\u2019t you eventually realize you\u2019re just the same stressed out person in a cute top or a fun skirt?\nPenny: Yeah, that\u2019s when I buy shoes. Now, let\u2019s see what we\u2019ve got. Ooh! This is nice.\nSheldon: It\u2019s only one colour.\nPenny: Yeah, so?\nSheldon: That\u2019s a lot of money for only one colour.\nPenny: Fine. Why don\u2019t you pick out what you like.\nSheldon: Hmm. (Cut to Sheldon exiting changing room in a loud check suit). This is pretty sharp.\nPenny: No, you\u2019re wrong.\nSheldon (now in a sparkly green suit with rhinestones): This is great. I had a suit like this when I was six. (Cut to Sheldon exiting in a white dinner suit with tails) Okay, I think we have a winner.\nPenny: Where the hell d\u2019you find that?\nSheldon: In the prom department.\nPenny: It\u2019s ridiculous.\nSheldon: Says the former member of the Corn Queen\u2019s Court.\nPenny: Please just try this one on.\nSheldon: Okay. But anything I put on now is only going to suffer in comparison. (Goes into changing room. Comes out in black suit looking terrific.) This is absurd. I look like a clown.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: So, Sheldon, how you doing?\nSheldon: That\u2019s how you start a psychotherapy session? How am I doing? I was promised a riverboat journey into the jungles of my subconscious. Instead, I get the same question I hear from the lady who slices my bologna at Ralph\u2019s.\nLeonard: I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019ll start again.\nSheldon: Would it be helpful to you if I told you about my dreams?\nLeonard: Um, I don\u2019t know, maybe.\nSheldon: I recently had a dream that I was a giant. But everything around me was to scale, so it all looked normal.\nLeonard: How did you know you were a giant if everything was to scale?\nSheldon: I was wearing size a million pants.\nLeonard: Why don\u2019t we just talk?\nSheldon: Ah, the talking cure. Classical Freudian, good choice. If it will help speed things along, uh, my answers to the standard Rorschach ink blot test are A, a bat, B, a bat, C, a bat, and D, my father killing my mother with a hypodermic needle.\nLeonard: Why don\u2019t I just start? Sometimes people have trouble accepting accolades if, on a subconscious level, they don\u2019t feel they deserve them. Do you think maybe that\u2019s what\u2019s happening here?\nSheldon: Really, Leonard? You\u2019re just going to try to recycle Adler\u2019s doctrine of the inferiority complex? I could probably get that from the woman at Ralph\u2019s. And she\u2019d let me taste some pieces of cheese for free.\nLeonard: But it could be part of your problem. Let me give you an example. When I was eight, I won a ribbon at the science fair for my project, \u201cDo Lima Beans Grow Better to Classical Music.\u201d But my mother pointed out that it was just a rehash of my brother\u2019s earlier \u201cDo Lima Beans Grow Worse to Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roll.\u201d I felt so guilty, I gave the ribbon back.\nSheldon: And how did that make you feel?\nLeonard: Terrible. I worked really hard on that project. I stayed up all night singing the clown\u2019s aria from Pagliacci to a lima bean sprout.\nSheldon: Go on.\nLeonard: It wasn\u2019t my fault. I had never seen my brother\u2019s project. And my mother could\u2019ve told me before instead of at the ceremony in front of everyone.\nSheldon: So, I hear you saying you\u2019re angry with your mother.\nLeonard: Damn right, I\u2019m angry with my mother. For God\u2019s sake, I was eight years old. She humiliated me. That\u2019s when the bed-wetting started again.\nSheldon: Thank you, Leonard.\nLeonard: For what?\nSheldon: If someone as damaged as you can find his way to crawl out of bed each morning, I think I can face a simple award ceremony.\nLeonard: Wait, that\u2019s it? I thought we had a whole hour!\nScene: The award ceremony.\nLeonard: Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Dr. Leonard Hofstadter, and it is my very great honour to introduce the winner of this year\u2019s Chancellor\u2019s award for Science and my good friend, Dr. Sheldon Cooper. But before I do, I\u2019d like to share with you a letter from Sheldon\u2019s mother, who couldn\u2019t be here tonight. Isn\u2019t that nice? His mother sent him a letter. She\u2019s proud of him. I wonder what that feels like. Dear Shelly. That\u2019s what she calls him. Shelly, it\u2019s a pet name. You know what my mother\u2019s pet name for me is? Leonard. But I digress. Dear Shelly. I am so proud of\u2026 (continues as background noise)\nSheldon: Oh, dear.\nPenny: What\u2019s the matter?\nSheldon: I\u2019m getting dizzy.\nRaj: Don\u2019t worry. You\u2019re surrounded by your C-Men.\nSheldon: I can\u2019t do this. I\u2019m going to faint.\nPenny: Here, drink this. It\u2019ll relax you.\nSheldon: Alcohol? I don\u2019t drink alcohol.\nPenny: Fine, faint.\nSheldon: I don\u2019t feel different, this alcohol\u2019s defective.\nPenny: Here, see if this one works.\nLeonard (still talking): First of all, the projects were totally different. I was showing that classical music nurtures lima beans and makes them grow, but my mother didn\u2019t hear me. If you\u2019d like to look at the relationship between nurturing and growth, I\u2019d like to point out that my brother is eight inches taller than me.\nSheldon: I\u2019m ready.\nLeonard: Oh, right. Ladies and gentlemen, our guest of honour, Dr. Sheldon Cooper.\nSheldon: Thanks, shorty,I\u2019ll take it from here. All right, you people ready to have some fun? You have a basic understanding of differential calculus and at least one year of algebraic topology? Well, then here come the jokes. Why did the chicken cross the Mobius strip? To get to the same side, bazinga! All right, a neutron walks into a bar and asks, how much for a drink? The bartender says, for you, no charge. Hello? I know you\u2019re out there. I can hear you metabolizing oxygen and expelling carbon dioxide. Looks like we have some academic dignitaries in the audience. Dr. Randall from the geology department, only man who\u2019s happy when they take his work for granite. Ba-da cha! I kid the geologists, of course, but it\u2019s only \u2019cause I have no respect for the field. Let\u2019s get serious for a moment. Why are we all here? \u2018Cause we\u2019re scientists. And what do scientists study? The universe. And what\u2019s the universe made of? I am so glad you asked. (Singing) There\u2019s antimony, arsenic, aluminium, selenium, and hydrogen and oxygen and nitrogen and rhenium, and nickel, neodymium,\nneptunium, germanium\u2026 Everybody! And iron, americium, ruthenium, uranium, europium, zirconium, lutetium, vanadium\u2026 Just the Asians! And lanthanum and osmium, and astatine and radium\u2026\nScene: The apartment.\n \nSheldon: Penny, Leonard. Would you be able to answer some questions I\u2019m having about the events of last night?\nPenny: Sure.\nSheldon: Question one, where are my pants?\nLeonard: You might want to check YouTube.\nSheldon: What do I search?\nLeonard: It\u2019s already loaded. Just hit play.\nOn-screen Sheldon: All right, people, let\u2019s get down to the math. It is only three dimensional thinking that limits our imagination. Can I take my pants off over my head? Of course not. My body\u2019s in the way. But if we had access to higher dimensions, we could move our pants around our bodies through the fourth dimension and our days of dropping trousers would be over.\nSheldon: Oh, Lord, this couldn\u2019t be any more humiliating.\nLeonard: Uh-uh, give it a minute.\nOn-screen Sheldon: Now, for the astronomers in the audience, get ready to see the dark side of the moon. And here\u2019s Uranus.\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "7_5": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The cafeteria.\nRaj: Hey, I read that someone invented a way to convert your footsteps into electromagnetic energy so you can charge your cell phone while walking.\nLeonard: We had that idea years ago. How come we never did anything with it?\nHoward: Probably because we left the diagram of it in the restaurant, and none of us wanted to walk back.\nSheldon: I know the real reason you never made progress with that idea. You thought of it September 22nd, 2007. Two days later, Penny moved in, and so much blood rushed to your genitals, your brain became a ghost town.\nLeonard: That\u2019s not what happened.\nSheldon: I remember it distinctly because I had just composed my annual poem commemorating the anniversary of Dr. Seuss\u2019s death.\nHoward: No one wants to hear it.\nSheldon: Why, die. Why did he die? Old, told. I was told he was old.\nLeonard: Penny is not the reason I didn\u2019t pursue that idea.\nSheldon: Oh, really? Since meeting her, what have been your greatest accomplishments?\nRaj: Easy. Sleeping with Penny.\nHoward: Getting Penny to go back out with him after she dumped him.\nRaj: Tricking Penny into getting engaged.\nHoward: And a few weeks ago, he almost did a pull-up.\nLeonard: I think someone owes me an apology.\nSheldon: Well, don\u2019t feel bad. I think we\u2019ve all been distracted since the girls entered our lives.\nHoward: You admit Amy\u2019s a distraction?\nSheldon: Oh, very much so. Listen to this. This is from two days ago. Hi. Hope you\u2019re having a good day. Who has time for this constant sexting?\nLeonard: Well, maybe we have lost our focus.\nHoward: It wouldn\u2019t kill us to get together and brainstorm ideas.\nRaj: Ooh, we could have one of those retreats.\nLeonardLike our own science retreat.\nHoward: My cousin has a cabin out in the woods.\nSheldon: I\u2019m not going to a cabin in the woods. Did you see the movie Cabin in the Woods?\nLeonard: Then we\u2019ll go to a hotel.\nSheldon: A hotel? Did you see The Shining?\nRaj: We could go up to Big Bear and get a house on the lake.\nSheldon: Did you see The Lake House?\nRaj: Nothing bad happens in The Lake House.\nSheldon: Yeah, well, no, not to them. To me. Time traveling mailbox. The only time that traveled was an hour and half of my life down the toilet.\nLeonard: Fine. Then we\u2019ll just stay here and do it.\nSheldon: Well, you didn\u2019t suggest a beach house.\nLeonard: You would go to a beach house?\nSheldon: Well, good Lord, no, have you seen Jaws?\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment.\nPenny: Hey.\nLeonard: Hey. So, the guys and I are talking about having kind of a science retreat this weekend. I just wanted to know if that\u2019s okay. You and I had talked about going to brunch on Sunday.\nPenny: Want to go to Vegas this weekend?\nAmy: Of course I do.\nPenny: Bernadette? Girl\u2019s weekend. Vegas. You in?\nBernadette: Hell, yeah.\nPenny: Yes. I\u2019ll check flights.\nBernadette: I\u2019ll check hotels.\nAmy: I\u2019ll check my underpants. I\u2019m so excited, I think I peed.\nLeonard: They seem okay with it.\nScene: The apartment.\nRaj: Hey.\nLeonard: Hey.\nHoward: Hey. I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d make it.\nRaj: Why not?\nHoward: Well, \u2019cause you have a steady girlfriend now, and we assumed you\u2019d have to stay home to lower the food down to her in the pit.\nRaj: For your information, Emily is working tonight.\nSheldon: Yeah, one would assume, on getting out of the pit.\nLeonard: Okay, let\u2019s focus. The girls are gone, we have 48 hours. There are no distractions. Let\u2019s change the world.\nSheldon: Thinking caps on.\nHoward: Here we go.\nRaj: Ooh, this is exciting. We\u2019re innovating. I feel like we\u2019re in the Facebook movie.\nHoward: Oh. I never saw that.\nSheldon: Really?\nRaj: Oh. It\u2019s wonderful, and I swear I\u2019m not saying that because Justin Timberlake is in it.\nSheldon: Yeah, I have it on Blu-ray. We should watch it.\nRaj: Cool. I\u2019ll make the popcorn.\nLeonard: Guys, in 30 seconds, we went from let\u2019s change the world to let\u2019s watch TV.\nSheldon: I\u2019m sorry. Is that a no?\nHoward: Okay. No. Leonard\u2019s right. We\u2019re here to focus. Didn\u2019t we used to have a list of all our ideas?\nLeonard: I, I think I still have it.\nSheldon: I did not get a clear answer. I\u2019m gonna set this down now.\nLeonard: Ah, here it is. Whoa. I haven\u2019t looked at these in years. Robot girlfriend.\nHoward: Mm, that was mine.\nLeonard: Robot prostitute.\nHoward: Also mine.\nSheldon: Wait. I\u2019m confused. Why would you need both a robot girlfriend and a robot prostitute?\nHoward: There\u2019s just some things you don\u2019t do with your robot girlfriend.\nRaj: Boy, when you met Bernadette, the field of robotics really took a hit.\nLeonard: Okay, let\u2019s just skip all the inventions you can have sex with. All right, no, here we go, ergonomic heated seat cushion.\nHoward: No, it vibrates. Keep going.\nLeonard: You know, let\u2019s just come up with something new.\nSheldon: You know, a number of significant innovations have been inspired by science fiction. The, the geosynchronous satellite from Arthur C. Clarke. The Motorola flip phone, that came from Star Trek. And I\u2019ve long suspected that the idea of an African-American president was stolen from the movie Deep Impact.\nRaj: Hey, the future they show in Back to the Future II is only a year away. A lot of the things in that movie haven\u2019t been invented yet.\nLeonard: How cool would that be if we could make one of those a reality?\nSheldon: If we could figure out the scientific basis for Marty\u2019s hover board, that would have universal application.\nLeonard: Well, it\u2019s, it\u2019s possible at absolute zero, but we would have to remove the temperature restrictions.\nRaj: Oh, I have an idea.\nSheldon: I think I have the same one.\nHoward: We got to watch Back to the Future II.\nRaj: I\u2019ll make the popcorn.\nScene: A Vegas hotel room.\nPenny: So, where should we go first?\nAmy: Ooh. There\u2019s a cover band in the lounge.\nPenny: Nah.\nAmy: But they play Barry Manilow.\nPenny: No.\nAmy: But they\u2019re called Fairly Manilow.\nPenny: Oh. Okay.\nAmy: Great.\nPenny: No.\nBernadette: Well, what do you want to do?\nPenny: Well, we\u2019re in Vegas. I want to go downstairs, get a bucket of margaritas, dance until I vomit all over a roulette wheel and watch it go everywhere.\nAmy: What if we don\u2019t want to vomit?\nPenny: Oh, you will. That\u2019s why they give you the bucket. Uh-oh.\nAmy: What?\nPenny: It\u2019s my boss. They moved my field ride up to Monday.\nAmy: What does that mean?\nPenny: It means instead of having a week to study, I only have two days.\nBernadette: That sucks.\nAmy: Can you start in the morning?\nPenny: Uh, it\u2019s kind of a lot. You know, let me do a little tonight, and I\u2019ll catch up with you guys later.\nBernadette: You sure?\nPenny: Yeah, it\u2019s okay. Go ahead.\nAmy: So, um, now that Penny\u2019s not coming\u2026\nBernadette: We\u2019re not seeing Fairly Manilow.\nAmy: Okay.\nScene: The apartment. \nHoward: Hold on. Pause. Something doesn\u2019t make sense. Look, in 2015, Biff steals the sports almanac and takes the time machine back to 1955, to give it to his younger self. But as soon as he does that, he changes the future, so the 2015 he returns to would be a different 2015, not the 2015 that Marty and Doc were in.\nLeoanard: This is Hot Tub Time Machine all over again. If future Biff goes back to 2015 right after he gives young Biff the almanac, he could get back to the 2015 with Marty and Doc in it. Because it wasn\u2019t until his 21st birthday that 1955 Biff placed his first bet.\nSheldon: Wait. Whoa, whoa. Is placed right?\nLeonard: What do you mean?\nSheldon: Is placed the right tense for something that would have happened in the future of a past that was affected by something from the future?\nLeonard: Had will have placed?\nSheldon: That\u2019s my boy.\nLeonard: Okay, so, it wasn\u2019t until his 21st birthday that Biff had will have placed his first bet and made his millions. That\u2019s when he altered the timeline.\nSheldon: Yeah, but he had will haven\u2019t placed it!\nHoward: What?\nSheldon: Unlike Hot Tub Time Machine, this couldn\u2019t be more simple. When Biff gets the almanac in 1955, the alternate future he creates isn\u2019t the one in which Marty and Doc Brown ever use the time machine to travel to 2015. Therefore, in the new timeline, Marty and Doc never brought the time machine\u2026\nLeonard: Wait. Is brought right?\nSheldon: Marty and Doc never had have had brought?\nLeonard: I don\u2019t know. You did it to me.\nSheldon: Oh, I\u2019m going with it. Marty and Doc never had have had brought the time machine to 2015. That means 2015 Biff could also not had have had brought the almanac to 1955 Biff. Therefore, the timeline in which 1955 Biff gets the almanac is also the timeline in which 1955 Biff never gets the almanac. And not just never gets. Never have, never hasn\u2019t, never had have hasn\u2019t.\nRaj: He\u2019s right. Also, what kind of name is Biff? Sounds like when you pop open a can of Pillsbury dough. Biff.\nHoward: Oh, that stuff is so good wrapped around cocktail weenies.\nLeonard: Guys.\nSheldon: Do you know that the word wiener comes from the German name of the Austrian capital Vienna, or Wien?\nRaj: Do you know if you look at Austria on a map it actually looks like a wiener?\nLeonard: Guys, what are we doing? We sent the girls away so we could focus.\nSheldon: I don\u2019t think it worked.\nScene: A bar in Vegas.\nAmy: Maybe after this, you\u2019ll be in the mood for some Manilow.\nBernadette: I think after this, I\u2019ll be dead.\nAmy: Look at us out, while Penny\u2019s in the room studying.\nBernadette: I\u2019m proud of her. This is a great opportunity. It\u2019s nice to see her take it seriously.\nAmy: It is. But enough about Penny. Let\u2019s talk about us. We\u2019re looking good.\nBernadette: We are.\nAmy: Better than good. I mean, look at you. Your body\u2019s bangin\u2019.\nBernadette: Amy.\nAmy: Don\u2019t Amy me. We\u2019re always talking about how hot Penny is. Come on, scientist to scientist, how big are those Hadron Colliders?\nBernadette: You\u2019re embarrassing me.\nAmy: Oh, don\u2019t be embarrassed. I\u2019ll show you the divot in my spine.\nBernadette: What?\nAmy: No, no, it\u2019s okay. I was born with it. If you put a double-A battery in there, it makes my leg kick.\nScene: Leonard\u2019s laboratory.\nLeonard: All right.\nSheldon: Oh, this is already better. There are far fewer distractions in here.\nRaj: Plus, this is where our minds are conditioned to focus on work.\nLeonard: So, I\u2019ve been thinking about the hover boards, and maybe there\u2019s a way we could use Maglev technology.\nHoward: Or if we could figure out a way to supercool the materials, we could utilize quantum coupling.\nSheldon: Well, I wonder if anyone\u2019s tried that.\nRaj: Go online and look it up.\nShortly afterwards.\nHoward: Oh, I can\u2019t argue with him. It\u2019s right there on the screen. Austria does look like a wiener.\nRaj: That\u2019s nothing, dude. Go check out how hung Florida is.\nLeonard: I\u2019m sure Mrs. Florida\u2019s walking funny. Can we get back to work?\nSheldon: Yeah, he\u2019s right. Oh, here\u2019s a thought. What if we use some form of operant conditioning techniques to keep us from getting off topic?\nHoward: Like behavior modification?\nSheldon: Yeah, exactly. Did you know those techniques were used to actually teach pigeons to play ping-pong?\nRaj: That cannot be true.\nShortly afterwards.\nRaj: Hey, it was match point.\nLeonard: Some psychologists perform operant conditioning with punishment. Maybe we can come up with a punishment for straying off topic.\nRaj: Not getting to see who wins at pigeon ping-pong comes to mind.\nHoward: We could snap a rubber band on our wrists every time we get sidetracked.\nSheldon: Mmm, not bad. You know, in medieval times, idle chatter was punished with a device called the scold\u2019s bridle. It\u2019s an iron cage that\u2019s locked around the head and pierces the tongue.\nLeonard: If only we had one.\nSheldon: Oh, I\u2019ll check Amazon.\nScene: The hotel room.\nBernadette: Housekeeping.\nAmy: We had a complaint about somebody pooping on a party in there.\nBernadette: It was us the whole time.\nAmy: Why\u2019d you tell her? It was working.\nBernadette: Was it working?\nPenny: Yeah.\nBernadette: Oh, I\u2019m so sorry.\nPenny: You guys look like you\u2019re having fun.\nAmy: We\u2019re having the best time.\nBernadette: Guess who won a hundred dollars playing craps.\nPenny: That\u2019s a dollar.\nBernadette: Then guess who wildly overtipped a cocktail waitress.\nAmy: Hey, Penny, hey, let\u2019s go. We found a place that has Australian male strippers.\nBernadette: We want to see if they twirl their junk in the other direction.\nPenny: That sounds so great. But I have a little more studying to do.\nAmy: Can you believe this nerd?\nBernadette: Come on, do you want to sit here being a loser, or do you want to watch me climb into an Australian man\u2019s G-string like a baby kangaroo?\nPenny: All right, guys, look, I would love to go out, but I\u2019ve got to get this done, okay? So have fun at the club. And if you get in trouble, find a policeman. And if he\u2019s taking off his pants, he is not a real policeman.\nAmy: Okay, okay, this is obviously very important to her. Let\u2019s just, we\u2019ll help her study so she can get done quicker. Here, here, I\u2019m gonna quiz you. I\u2019m gonna quiz you. I got your notes. I got your notes. I got your notes. If you want these, they\u2019re gonna be at the strip club.\nBernadette: Aren\u2019t you gonna chase her?\nPenny: To the walk-in closet? Sure.\nScene: Leonard\u2019s lab.\nLeonard: Okay, so we agree, whenever someone takes us off topic they get their arm hair yanked off.\nRaj: And I really can\u2019t let that happen or the girl who does my eyebrows will think I\u2019ve been cheating on her.\nLeonard: All right, now, one benefit of quantum coupling\u2026\nSheldon: Wait, a question, who decides if someone\u2019s gone off topic?\nLeonard: I think it\u2019ll be pretty clear. If not, we\u2019ll take a vote. Oh, and also\u2026\nSheldon: Ow. We didn\u2019t vote!\nLeonard: We didn\u2019t have to, that was clearly a tangent. Now come on. Back to work. If we\u2019re leaning towards quantum coupling\u2026 Aah! Why?\nSheldon: You said quantum coupling. That made me think of the show Quantum Leap. That\u2019s a tangent and it\u2019s your fault.\nHoward: That\u2019s ridiculous. Sheldon, I vote that is not a tangent.\nLeonard: Thank you. And now I owe you one.\nSheldon: Ow. That was your fault.\nHoward: Hey.\nRaj: Ooh, that is a lot of hair. Ow. And now I\u2019m gonna hear it from Jenny.\nLeonard: Everyone stop. This was a stupid idea. Negative reinforcement isn\u2019t working.\nSheldon: I think you mean positive punishment. Negative reinforcement is the removal of a positive stimulus. It\u2019s a common mistake.\nHoward: Negative reinforcement is really wrong?\nSheldon: Oh, it\u2019s used incorrectly all the time. Even Bill Murray makes that mistake in the first scene of Ghostbusters.\nRaj: No way. Not Bill Murray.\nShortly afterwards.\nBill Murray (on screen): I\u2019m studying the effect of negative reinforcement on ESP ability.\nRaj: Huh. Bill Murray did get it wrong.\nHoward: Jump ahead to the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man.\nLeonard: No.\nSheldon: Leonard\u2019s right. We can\u2019t just jump ahead. We have to watch the whole movie.\nLeonard: Look. We keep procrastinating. We saw Back to the Future II, pigeons playing ping-pong, a bunch of countries that look like genitals and one guy whose genitals look like Denmark.\nRaj: Yeah, sorry for clicking on that.\nLeonard: It\u2019s late. We\u2019ve wasted hours. Can we please find it in ourselves to do any amount of work tonight?\nSheldon: But we didn\u2019t see them bust one ghost.\nLeonard: So you\u2019re, you\u2019re saying we should stand here in my lab on a Saturday night and watch the rest of Ghostbusters on a crappy laptop?\nSheldon: No.\nScene: The apartment.\nAll: Ghostbusters!\nLeonard: It really does hold up.\nScene: The Vegas strip club.\nBernadette: See? Isn\u2019t this better than a hotel room?\nPenny: Yep. Shake that thing.\nBernadette: Have you ever seen a body so fine?\nAmy: We had some pretty hot corpses in my anatomy class, but none of them moved like that.\nScene: The hotel room.\nPenny: Good morning. You want to go to the pool? Come on, you said it yourself, only nerds and losers stay in the room. Wow, it\u2019s bright out. Isn\u2019t it bright? I should probably close these curtains. Nah. Bye.\nBernadette: Would you please close the drapes?\nAmy: Okay.\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "5_13": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The stairwell.\nLeonard: You feel like trying something new for dinner? Maybe Indian, Tex-Mex?\nSheldon: You ever wonder how humans would be different if they evolved from lizards instead of mammals?\nLeonard: Okay, let\u2019s talk about that.\nSheldon: As you know, lizards, cold-blooded animals, lack the ability to sense temperature. But they do move more sluggishly when it\u2019s cold. So, lizard weathermen would say things like, bring a sweater, it\u2019s slow outside. I love my mind.\nLeonard: We all do. Now, how about dinner?\nSheldon: Oh, I would assume we\u2019d enjoy insects or smaller lizards. We could also pull each other\u2019s tails off and grill them, they\u2019ll just grow back. Oh! My life-size cardboard Mr. Spock is here! I know he wouldn\u2019t care for an outburst of human emotion, but, oh goodie, oh goodie, oh goodie. Commander Spock requesting permission to be unfolded.\nLeonard (seeing Penny\u2019s door open and the girls inside): Excuse me.\nSheldon: Permission granted, Commander.\nAmy: Which is why the more intelligent the monkey, the more faeces they fling.\nLeonard: Excuse me, Amy. Penny, do you have plans for dinner tonight?\nPenny: Why, you guys going somewhere?\nLeonard: No, I mean just you and me.\nPenny: You mean, like a date?\nLeonard: Not like a date, a date.\nAmy: Ooh!\nBernadette: Ooh!\nPenny: Um, o-okay. Sure.\nAmy: Ooh!\nBernadette: Ooh!\nSheldon: Oh, no! They sent the wrong Spock! Live long and suck it, Zachary Quinto.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: Penny\u2019s bedroom.\nBernadette: This is so exciting. If Leonard and Penny get back together, Howard and I can go on double dates with them.\nAmy: How come you never invite Sheldon and me on a double date?\nBernadette: Mm, uh\u2026 How\u2019s it going in there, Penny?\nPenny: Just a sec. (Emerges in revealing slinky green dress) Too much?\nBernadette: Yes.\nAmy: No.\nPenny: Okay, just hang on.\nAmy: You just can\u2019t handle her raw sexuality, can you?\nBernadette: When did you and Leonard break up?\nPenny: Uh, about two years ago.\nBernadette: Why do you think he asked you out again?\nPenny: I don\u2019t know.\nAmy: Maybe he\u2019s dying. That would be so romantic.\nPenny: He\u2019s not dying.\nAmy: Too bad. If he were, she could just throw him in bed and ride him right up until he flatlines.\nPenny: How about this?\nBernadette: Maybe.\nAmy: Come on.\nPenny: Yeah, okay, no.\nBernadette: Do you think you\u2019ll sleep with him tonight?\nPenny: Absolutely not. Look, we\u2019re just gonna have dinner and, you know, see how it goes.\nAmy: If he were dying, would you sleep with him?\nPenny: What?\nAmy: Assuming he were dying of something that couldn\u2019t be sexually transmitted. You know, like a spear wound to the head.\nPenny: Okay, he is not dying.\nAmy: How do you know? Are you a doctor?\nBernadette: You can make-believe, though. Sometimes Howard and I pretend that his arrhythmia is acting up and I\u2019m a sexy cardiologist. And the naughty part is I\u2019m not in his HMO network.\nPenny: Screw it. I\u2019m not gonna make a big deal out of this. It\u2019s just dinner.\nAmy: With a dead man.\nPenny: Amy, stop it. Oh, God, I\u2019m so nervous.\nBernadette: Relax. You know Leonard\u2019s always been crazy about you. It\u2019s gonna be great.\nPenny: I know, but we\u2019ve finally gotten to a place where we can hang out without it being weird. And what if something goes wrong? Then what?\nAmy: Guess it\u2019ll just be Sheldon and me going on a double date with Howard and Bernadette.\nBernadette: Sure, we\u2019d love that. Change your clothes, we got a lot riding on this.\nScene: The apartment. The guys are playing a board game.\nSheldon: Mm. I want to build a road, but I need wood. Do either of you fellows have wood? (Raj and Howard snigger) I don\u2019t understand the laughter. The object of Settlers of Catan is to build roads and settlements. To do so requires wood. Now, I have sheep; I need wood. Who has wood for my sheep?\nLeonard: Okay, how do I look?\nHoward: Well, more to the point, why are you doing this?\nLeonard: What are you talking about?\nRaj: Did you forget what Penny did to you? It took you two years and defiling my sister to turn that frown upside down.\nLeonard: I didn\u2019t defile your sister, we had a relationship.\nRaj: I heard you call her Brown Sugar. In my book, that\u2019s defilement.\nSheldon: You want to know my opinion?\nLeonard: Oh, boy, do I?\nSheldon: Sarcasm?\nHoward: No.\nSheldon: All right, then. The reason you\u2019re fixated on a good-natured simpleton like Penny is that she\u2019s the exact opposite of your first romantic attachment, your brilliant yet intimidating mother.\nLeonard: Where on earth did you get that from?\nSheldon: It\u2019s in her book, Needy Baby, Greedy Baby.\nLeonard: That doesn\u2019t make it true.\nSheldon: It\u2019s called non-fiction for a reason, Leonard.\nLeonard: See you later.\nRaj: If they ever make a movie version of that book, you know who should play Leonard\u2019s mother? Sandra Bullock.\nHoward: Why?\nRaj: Because she\u2019s great in everything.\nSheldon: Now, where were we? Oh, yes. Does anyone have any wood? Oh, come on! I just want wood. Why are you making it so hard?\nScene: A restaurant.\nLeonard: So, do they have a name for a first date with someone you used to go out with?\nPenny: Oh, that\u2019s a good question. How about awkward?\nLeonard: Yeah, that sounds right.\nPenny: Yeah?\nLeonard: Hey, how about if we pretend we\u2019re actually on a first date? See how that goes.\nPenny: Okay.\nLeonard: So, Polly, tell me about yourself.\nPenny: It\u2019s Penny.\nLeonard: Oh, sorry, yeah. Awkward.\nPenny: Okay, uh, let\u2019s see. I\u2019m from Nebraska, and ever since I was a little girl, I dreamed of moving to L.A. and becoming a movie star. Anyway, after four years of acting lessons and waiting tables, I\u2019ve done a haemorrhoid commercial and a production of Anne Frank above a bowling alley. So, you know, dreams do come true. Your turn.\nLeonard: Uh, let\u2019s see. Uh, I am an experimental physicist at Cal-Tech, most of my research is with high-powered lasers, and, oh, I\u2019ve just gotten a big government grant to see if they can be used to knock out incoming ballistic missiles.\nPenny: Wow. Can they?\nLeonard: Oh, God, no. The money\u2019s pretty good. And I used the equipment to make my own Bat-signal.\nPenny: Bat-signal? What are you, some kind of nerd?\nLeonard: Not some kind of nerd, I am the king of the nerds.\nPenny: What does that mean?\nLeonard: Uh, it means if anyone displeases me, I don\u2019t help them set up their printer.\nPenny: You are so funny.\nLeonard: Good. Remember that when I take my shirt off.\nPenny: Leonard, this is nice. I\u2019m so glad we did this.\nLeonard: Me, too. So what do you think? Are we gonna get back together?\nPenny: Whoa. Not so fast.\nLeonard: I\u2019m sorry, what did I say?\nPenny: Leonard, you know I will always have feelings for you.\nLeonard: Oh, God.\nPenny: What?\nLeonard: You said always. You\u2019ll always have feelings for me.\nPenny: So?\nLeonard: So, that sounds more like something you\u2019d say if you didn\u2019t want a relationship with someone. This isn\u2019t working out, but I\u2019ll always have feelings for you. I\u2019m sorry I slept with your best friend, but I\u2019ll always have feelings for you. Here\u2019s the thing, Lisa, I\u2019m into dudes now, but I\u2019ll always have feelings for you.\nPenny: How would you say it?\nLeonard: I have feelings for you.\nPenny: It\u2019s the same thing.\nLeonard: No, it\u2019s not. Always made it worse.\nPenny: You\u2019re overthinking this.\nLeonard: No, I\u2019m not.\nPenny: Yes, you are. You always overthink things.\nLeonard: Ah now th-th-there you go. Always made it worse.\nPenny: See, this is where everything goes wrong, when we talk.\nLeonard: Well, I don\u2019t know how you have a relationship without talking.\nPenny: Hey, I went out with this guy TJ for eight months, we never talked. To this day, I don\u2019t even know what TJ stands for.\nLeonard: Wait, if you guys didn\u2019t talk, what did you\u2026 never mind, stupid question.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: And now that I have some wood, I\u2019m going to begin the erection of my settlement.\nRaj: He\u2019s got to be doing this on purpose.\nHoward (as Leonard enters): Ooh, eight thirty. You and Penny decide to go out and paint the town beige?\nLeonard: You\u2019re thirty years old and you live with your mother.\nRaj: I guess it didn\u2019t go well.\nSheldon: We don\u2019t know that. Not to a certainty. All we know is that Leonard is home.\nHoward (as Leonard groans loudly in his room): How about now?\nSheldon: Again, not enough evidence. For all we know, he\u2019s being murdered. Now, back to our game.\nRaj: You were in the middle of an erection.\nSheldon: Oh, of course. It\u2019s right here in my hand.\nScene: Leonard\u2019s bedroom. Leonard\u2019s phone text signal sounds.\nLeonard: What does she want from me now? (Goes to front door, where Penny is waiting) What\u2019s up?\nPenny: Do not overthink this. (Kisses him, then leads him to her apartment.) \nLeonard: I don\u2019t understand.\nPenny: Bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup.\nLeonard: Okay, but earlier it seemed like\u2026\nPenny: No talking.\nLeonard: Even during? \u2018Cause sometimes I have questions.\nScene: Penny\u2019s bedroom. They are in bed.\nPenny: Well, that was fun.\nLeonard: Yeah, except for when I got the foot cramp.\nPenny: You hung in there, though.\nLeonard: Well, there was a lot at stake.\nPenny: So what do you want to do now?\nLeonard: Well, I want to go get my asthma inhaler, but it might ruin the moment. Just, just help me out here. How does a miserable date end in sex?\nPenny: I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s complicated.\nLeonard: Well, I\u2019m a pretty smart guy, and right now my brain has dibs on the blood supply, so give it a go.\nPenny: Okay, it\u2019s just, at the restaurant when you said you wanted us to be together again, it got very real very fast and I panicked.\nLeonard: Why? What are you afraid of?\nPenny: Well, what if we do go out and I do something stupid and dump you again?\nLeonard: What if I dump you?\nPenny: Come on, be serious.\nLeonard: Well, how about if we don\u2019t think about this as a relationship? It could be more like a new version of software. Penny and Leonard 2.0. We can test it internally, shake out the bugs, and if we both feel it\u2019s solid, then we\u2019ll roll it out to the public.\nPenny: So we don\u2019t tell people we\u2019re back together?\nLeonard: Exactly. We pretend like our date went badly.\nPenny: Well, we don\u2019t really have to pretend.\nLeonard: And we let them think that we decided to just be friends and that everything\u2019s cool.\nPenny: Okay, great. Hey, I just remembered. I still got one of your inhalers.\nLeonard: I can\u2019t believe you kept this.\nPenny: Yeah, I was gonna throw it away, but I just couldn\u2019t.\nLeonard: That is so sweet. In 25 to 30 minutes I\u2019m gonna show you how much this means to me.\nScene: The apartment. Leonard is sneaking back in.\nSheldon: Leonard?\nLeonard: Yeah, hi, hi. How\u2019s it going?\nSheldon: Uh, can\u2019t complain. Thanks for asking. Well, what were you doing out at three o\u2019clock in the morning?\nLeonard: Well, uh, uh, what are you doing up?\nSheldon: I was using the bathroom.\nLeonard: Yeah, well, so was I.\nSheldon: Really? I didn\u2019t see you in there.\nLeonard: Obviously, when I saw that you were in ours, I went and used another one.\nSheldon: Where?\nLeonard: The, the gas station across the street.\nSheldon: In your pyjamas?\nLeonard: Yes.\nSheldon: Without shoes?\nLeonard: Yes.\nSheldon: On a cold winter\u2019s night?\nLeonard: Yes.\nSheldon: Seems unlikely. Did you bring your asthma inhaler?\nLeonard: Uh, uh, uh, yes, I did.\nSheldon: Well, then, I guess it\u2019s plausible. Hang on a second, mister.\nLeonard: What?\nSheldon: After you used the facilities at the gas station, did you make a purchase?\nLeonard: What?\nSheldon: It\u2019s customary, when using the rest room at a retail establishment, to make a small purchase. Did you?\nLeonard: No.\nSheldon: Here\u2019s two dollars. Go buy some beef jerky.\nLeonard: I don\u2019t want beef jerky.\nSheldon: It\u2019s not about you. It\u2019s about a poor immigrant from Pakistan trying to make his way in America by working the graveyard shift at the Colorado Boulevard Chevron.\nLeonard: Fine.\nSheldon: Needy Baby, Greedy Baby indeed.\nScene: The Cheesecake Factory.\nSheldon: Leonard will be here in a moment. He\u2019s looking for a different parking space.\nHoward: Why?\nSheldon: We were next to a car with an ask me about my grandchildren bumper sticker, and I was afraid if we ran into them on the way out, I\u2019d be obligated to do so.\nBernadette: I\u2019m so disappointed it didn\u2019t work with him and Penny.\nAmy: Me, too. Out of deference to them, let\u2019s not flaunt our happy relationship.\nSheldon: You have a keen insight into the human heart, Amy Farrah Fowler.\nLeonard: We are next to a Suburu with a Gore/Lieberman bumper sticker.\nSheldon: Well, I doubt they\u2019d want to talk about that, so we\u2019re fine.\nHoward: I\u2019m surprised to see you here after it went so badly with Penny.\nLeonard: Well, hey, we\u2019re grown-ups. We can still be friends.\nBernadette: Boy, I don\u2019t know if I could be friends with Howie if we broke up.\nHoward: Why not?\nBernadette: I\u2019m a very vengeful person.\nHoward: Really?\nBernadette: With access to weaponised smallpox.\nPenny: Here you go, guys, let me get you going with some water. You need menus or you know what you want?\nHoward: Leonard knows what he wants, but it looks like he\u2019s not gonna get it from you.\nBernadette: Howard.\nPenny: No, that\u2019s okay, Bernadette. Sometimes these things just don\u2019t work out.\nLeonard: Yeah, it\u2019s all good. We-We\u2019ll always have feelings for each other.\nBernadette: Oh, that\u2019s nice.\nLeonard: See, she knew what always meant.\nPenny: Wow, you\u2019re like a dog with a bone, aren\u2019t you?\nLeonard: I\u2019m just making a point.\nPenny: Is the point that you don\u2019t know when to let something go?\nSheldon: People, people, please, before you say something you both regret, I\u2019d like to place my order.\nPenny: Yeah, just hang on, Sheldon. You know why we can\u2019t be together? Because you always have to be right.\nLeonard: Oh, that is not true.\nSheldon: I\u2019ve got to go with Leonard on this. He is wrong more than anyone I know.\nPenny: You know what? I just realized I\u2019m on a break. I\u2019ll get someone else.\nLeonard: Well\u2026\nSheldon: Leonard, promise me that when our new waitress comes over, you will not start a complicated on-again, off-again relationship with her, because I am very, very hungry.\nScene: Leonard\u2019s bedroom. Text signal.\nLeonard: Unbelievable. (Goes to door)\nPenny: Mind explaining to me why you were being such a jerk at the restaurant?\nLeonard: Well, I was trying to act like we weren\u2019t seeing each other. That was the plan, right?\nPenny: No, the plan was to tell people we decided to stay friends. That\u2019s a little hard to do when you\u2019re always being such a tool bag.\nLeonard: You know what? I don\u2019t have to stand here and take this crap. (Goes to Penny\u2019s apartment.)\nPenny: The hell do you think you\u2019re going?\nLeonard: Isn\u2019t sex after fighting kind of what we do now?\nPenny: Yeah, kind of, yeah.\nScene: Penny\u2019s bedroom.\nLeonard: What are we doing?\nPenny: What do you mean?\nLeonard: Every scenario I play out for you and me ends badly.\nPenny: That\u2019s because you overthink everything.\nSheldon\u2019s voice: Leonard, are you listening to me? (Leonard is in the hallway with Sheldon. It is the opening scene, and Sheldon has just found his cardboard Spock.) \nLeonard: What? Yeah.\nSheldon: This is a disaster. I distinctly ordered the Leonard Nimoy Mr. Spock cardboard standee. Why would I feel safer with Zachary Quinto at the foot of my bed?\nLeonard: I don\u2019t know, he was pretty badass on Heroes.\nSheldon: You\u2019re right, I\u2019ll give him a shot.\nLeonard: Hang on. Penny, do you have plans for dinner?\nPenny: Why, you guys going somewhere?\nLeonard: No, I mean just you and me.\nAmy: Ooh!\nBernadette: Ooh!\nPenny: Uh, have you thought this through?\nLeonard: Yes, and I think we should go anyway.\nSheldon: No, can\u2019t do it. Sorry, Quinto, you\u2019re going back.\nScene: Penny\u2019s bedroom.\nAmy: If you and Leonard get back together, Sheldon and I will finally have someone to go on double dates with.\nBernadette: What about me and Howard?\nAmy: Fine, we can double with you, too. So insecure.\nBernadette: Where are you guys going to eat?\nAmy: Penny?\n(In her imagination, Penny is transported to her wedding day.)\nMinister: Do you, Penny, take Leonard to be your lawful wedded husband?\nPenny (turning, heavily pregnant): Well, it\u2019s a little late for me to start saying no, isn\u2019t it?\n(Back in the bedroom)\nAmy: Penny?\nPenny: Sorry, just remembered I\u2019ve got to stop by the drugstore.\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "5_7": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: Sheldon\u2019s office.\nSheldon: And reverse the spin on the antiproton, and gamma becomes alpha, multiplied by a matrix of negative I comma zero, and there we have it. Conclusive proof that I am absolutely worthless after nine o\u2019clock.\nGhostly voice: Sheldon, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Hmm. (Looks outside office door. Corridor lamp sparks and goes out. Corridor is bathed in an eerie glow) All right, all right. I see what\u2019s going on. A little pre-Halloween hijinkery. A ghostly moan, a rattling of chains, a witch\u2019s cackle. The trifecta of haunted house clich\u00e9s. Instead of eek, I say yawn.\nGhostly voice: Sheldon.\nSheldon: Oh, the walls are dripping blood, which looks nothing like a phenolphthalein indicator exposed to a sodium carbonate solution. (Reading message on wall) See you in hell Sheldon. The most frightening thing about that is the missing comma. (A luminous skeleton rushes towards him) Ah. Okay, all right. That one was clever. Skeleton with phosphorous on a zip line. Come on out, merry pranksters. Take a bow.\nRaj: You should\u2019ve seen your face.\nSheldon: Yes, there\u2019s nothing quite like the slightly widened eyes of mildly startled.\nHoward: Come on, admit it. We got you, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Please, fright depends on an element of surprise. The simple fact is, because I am much smarter than you, and able to anticipate your actions, it is highly unlikely that you two rubes could ever surprise me. (Leonard creeps out behind him wearing a Star Trek Balok mask)\nRaj: He\u2019s probably right.\nHoward: We can\u2019t beat him. He\u2019s just too smart.\nSheldon: Gentlemen. (Turns and sees Leonard. Screams and faints).\nHoward: Who had money on faints?\nRaj: I had pee his pants.\nLeonard: Hang on. Looks like everyone\u2019s a winner.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The comic book store.\nLeonard: Oh. Watch out, Sheldon. This little boy Casper is a g-g-g-ghost!\nSheldon: Droll.\nHoward:Not as droll as a grown man passed out in a puddle of his own urine.\nLeonard: That was pretty droll. With a hint of ammonia.\nSheldon: Yes, enjoy your japes, gentlemen. You think you\u2019ve poked fun at a milquetoast academic. Well, you\u2019ve forgotten one thing. I am also a son of the Lone Star state. I\u2019m Texas through and through. And we know how to settle scores down there. If you doubt me, ask Mexico.\nStuart: Hot girl, nine o\u2019clock. Don\u2019t everybody look at once!\nRaj: What is she doing in a comic book store?\nStuart: I don\u2019t know, she might be lost. Doesn\u2019t matter. Watch and learn. Hi.\nHot girl: Hi.\nStuart: Um\u2026 it-it-it\u2026 (returns to guys) Shut up.\nHot girl (to Leonard): Are you getting this Next Men?\nLeonard: Uh, yeah. It\u2019s issue number 21. First appearance of Hellboy.\nHot girl: I know. I\u2019ve been looking for it for years.\nLeonard: Sorry.\nHot girl: Hey, if I pretended to hit on you, could I distract you enough to sneak it away?\nLeonard: Yes, but you\u2019d be using your superpowers for evil.\nHot girl: Damn, I\u2019m forbidden by my Kryptonian father to do so. I am Alice.\nLeonard: Leonard.\nAlice: You are very cute, Leonard.\nLeonard: Thanks. You, too. You know, go ahead and take it.\nAlice: No, no. No, no, I, I, I did evil. Would you be open to a trade?\nLeonard: Uh, yeah, yeah, sure, I guess.\nAlice: Okay. Here. This is my number, call me.\nLeonard: Sorry, palm\u2019s a little sweaty. What\u2019s that word?\nAlice: Alice.\nLeonard: Oh, right, your name. That makes more sense than penis.\nAlice: Later.\nHoward: Did we just see you pick up a girl in a comic book store?\nStuart: \u2018Cause if you did, you get your picture up there on the Wall of Heroes.\nLeonard: No, I don\u2019t think I picked her up. Besides, I have a girlfriend.\nStuart: Doesn\u2019t matter. This is the closest anyone\u2019s ever come. You\u2019re going on the wall, my friend.\nScene: Entering the apartment building.\nSheldon: Be sure to check the mail.\nLeonard: How many times are you gonna tell me? What\u2019s with you?\nSheldon: Nothing. It\u2019s not suspicious that I\u2019m fixating. It\u2019s consistent with my personality.\nLeonard: Right.\nPenny: Hey, guys.\nLeonard: More Halloween candy? Didn\u2019t you just buy a bunch of it yesterday?\nPenny: Oh. Yeah. That\u2019s gone. It\u2019s a rough month when Halloween and PMS hit at the same time.\nSheldon: Leonard doesn\u2019t have time to chat, he has to get the mail.\nLeonard: Will you relax? I\u2019ll get it in a minute. Hey, how was work?\nSheldon: Open the mail!\nLeonard: Excuse me. (Sheldon holds fingers in ears) A couple of circulars, nothing important.\nPenny: What\u2019s with him?\nLeonard: Hang on. (Sheldon opens mail box. A loud horn blows and a balloon with Leonard\u2019s face on pops out. Sheldon faints again.) You might be from Texas, but I\u2019m from New Jersey.\nScene: The apartment. Leonard is with Alice.\nLeonard: Check it out. Jim Lee drew this of me two years ago at Comic Con.\nAlice: What are you wearing?\nLeonard: Well, you know, it\u2019s Comic Con. I\u2019m Lion-O from ThunderCats.\nAlice: Wow, you must have gotten so laid.\nLeonard: No. But Jessica Alba did rub my furry belly.\nAlice: Want to see a comic I draw?\nLeonard: You\u2019re kidding. You have your own book?\nAlice: Yeah. It\u2019s kinda based on my life.\nLeonard: Cool. Oh, look. That\u2019s you having sex with a guy in the top half of a Chewbacca costume. Comic Con?\nAlice: You\u2019d think, but no.\nLeonard: You\u2019re very talented. This is really good. Did you do\u2026 (she kisses him.)\nAlice: So, can I trade you my comic for the Hellboy?\nLeonard: You can have my car.\nScene: Sheldon\u2019s office.\nSheldon (creeps into office carrying a box): Oh, dear. (Reaches into box, picks up a snake) Oh, dear. (Puts snake into Raj\u2019s top drawer) Oh, dear, oh, dear. Oh, dear, oh, dear. Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Purell, Purell, Purell, Purell.\nRaj (entering): Good morning, Sheldon.\nSheldon: It is, isn\u2019t it? Oh, bother. Isn\u2019t that just always the way? You go to staple something, and you\u2019re out of staples. Gosh, I wish I\u2019d known that earlier today when I was at Staples.\nRaj: You have a thing of paper clips right there.\nSheldon: well, no, no, I need something more permanent to join these papers. Say, don\u2019t you keep staples in your top desk drawer?\nRaj: I don\u2019t know. Maybe.\nSheldon: Be a lamb and check.\nRaj: All right. (Opening drawer) Who do we have here?\nSheldon: It\u2019s a snake. A terrifying snake.\nRaj: Oh, did some bad man put us in a drawer?\nSheldon: Stop talking like that. You\u2019ve been rendered speechless by fear.\nRaj: Let\u2019s go to the biology lab and find you some nice yummy mice.\nSheldon: I tried to scare an Indian with a snake. Come on, Cooper. You\u2019re better than this.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment. There is a knock.\nPenny: It\u2019s open.\nLeonard: Hey, you got a minute?\nPenny: Yeah, sure, come on in.\nLeonard: Thanks.\nPenny: Want some mac and cheese?\nLeonard: No. Lactose. Gas.\nPenny: Glass of wine?\nLeonard: No. Sulfites. Migraines.\nPenny: Okay, well, I\u2019d offer you Halloween candy, but that\u2019s gone. So, what\u2019s up?\nLeonard: Okay, we used to go out, right?\nPenny: Oh, my God, that\u2019s where I know you from.\nLeonard: I\u2019m dealing with a situation and it\u2019s kind of about my love life, so I know that might be weird for us to talk about, but in this area, as you know, all my other friends are just so stupid.\nPenny: All right, what\u2019s going on?\nLeonard: So, you\u2019re okay talking about this?\nPenny: Yes.\nLeonard: You\u2019re sure it\u2019s not weird.\nPenny: It\u2019s okay.\nLeonard: You know what, if you ever want to talk to me about a problem in your life with a guy, then I would be fine with that.\nPenny: Okay, good, because there\u2019s this one guy I used to date who\u2019s about to be force-fed wine and cheese if he doesn\u2019t get to the point.\nLeonard: Okay, uh, here it is. Is it cheating if a guy has a girlfriend\u2026\nPenny: Yeah, probably.\nLeonard: Come on.\nPenny: I\u2019m sorry, go ahead.\nLeonard: I met this girl, and she\u2019s great. We have a lot in common.\nPenny: Did you guys do it?\nLeonard: No. We just made out a little.\nPenny: Oh, look at you, you bad boy. Did you tell her about Priya?\nLeonard: Well, I was gonna, but there were too many tongues in my mouth.\nPenny: That\u2019s gross.\nLeonard: Here\u2019s the thing, I, I\u2019m not one of those guys who sneaks around and sleeps with more than one woman.\nPenny: Well, good for you.\nLeonard: The problem is, I want to be one of those guys.\nPenny: So sleep with the new girl and lie to Priya.\nLeonard: Oh, that\u2019s not who I am.\nPenny: All right, then break it off with the new girl.\nLeonard: Now, let\u2019s not do anything rash. She\u2019s really hot.\nPenny: If you like this girl so much, why don\u2019t you just end things with Priya?\nLeonard: Priya and I are in love. I think we could get married someday.\nPenny: Leonard, you\u2019re looking for a way to sleep with both women and have everybody be happy about it.\nLeonard: Now we\u2019re getting somewhere.\nPenny: What does your gut tell you?\nLeonard: Go ask Penny; she\u2019ll know what to do.\nScene: The apartment. Sheldon is adjusting a device on his arm.\nSheldon: Hello, Howard. I\u2019ve realized that you scaring me was all in jest. Allow me to say, job well done. (Grabs his own hand. Electrocutes himself.) Perfect.\nLeonard: What are you doing?\nSheldon: Science. You wouldn\u2019t understand.\nLeonard: Hey, well, see you. I\u2019m going out. (Starts to go out. Doesn\u2019t.)\nSheldon: I thought you were leaving the apartment.\nLeonard: Yeah, me, too. I can\u2019t make up my mind.\nSheldon: Are you concerned because the world is filled with big dogs and bullies?\nLeonard: No. I\u2019m having a moral crisis.\nSheldon: Well, if it\u2019s of any help, I\u2019ve read all the great moral philosophers, including Dr. Seuss.\nLeonard: Oh, what the hell. I\u2019m supposed to go see that girl from the comic book store, Alice, but I don\u2019t know if I should, because I\u2019m going out with Priya, but she\u2019s in India.\nSheldon: All right. So the topic at hand is sexual fidelity. Probably won\u2019t be relying on Seuss here. Although One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish might be surprisingly applicable. Go on.\nLeonard: Well, they say at the end of your life, you regret the stuff you didn\u2019t do more than the stuff that you did, and I\u2019m pretty sure Alice is the stuff I want to do.\nSheldon: You know, the German philosopher, Friedrich Nietzsche, believed that morality is just a fiction used by the herd of inferior human beings to hold back the few superior men.\nLeonard: That actually does help.\nSheldon: It\u2019s worth noting that he died of syphilis.\nLeonard: Screw it, I\u2019m going.\nSheldon: On your way home, will you pick up some orange juice?\nLeonard: Do you mind? I\u2019m questioning a lot of things in my life right now.\nSheldon: Is one of those things your fondness for orange juice?\nLeonard: No.\nSheldon: Great. Tropicana, no pulp.\nScene: Howard\u2019s house. Sheldon rings the doorbell.\nHoward: Hey, Sheldon.\nBernadette (off): Who is it?\nSheldon: It\u2019s me, Sheldon, Mrs. Wolowitz.\nHoward: That\u2019s not my mom, it\u2019s Bernadette.\nSheldon: Really? That\u2019s very unsettling.\nBernadette: Hi, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Hi.\nHoward: What\u2019s up?\nSheldon: It just occurred to me that I never formally congratulated you on your pending nuptials. So I hopped on the first bus and hightailed it down here to shake your hand. Put \u2018er there, you old so-and-so.\nHoward: Well, I, I\u2019m gonna see you at work in 12 hours, don\u2019t you think it could have waited until then?\nSheldon: Holy smoke, why didn\u2019t I think of that? You\u2019re a better man than I, Howard Wolowitz. You put \u2018er there, you son of a gun!\nHoward: Whatever. (Takes his hand. Starts to be electrocuted) My\u2026 oh\u2026 it\u2019s\u2026 (Clutches heart and collapses)\nBernadette: Oh, my God, Howard! What did you do?\nSheldon: It was a harmless Halloween prank. Look.\nBernadette: Howard has a heart condition! You know that!\nSheldon: Well, I thought he made that up. Isn\u2019t hypochondria a common idiosyncrasy of Jewish people?\nBernadette: This is adrenaline, we\u2019re gonna have to inject it into his heart.\nSheldon: We are?\nBernadette: You are. I\u2019m not strong enough to get it through his chest plate, and we\u2019ve only got one shot.\nSheldon: Oh, no! I can\u2019t!\nBernadette: Hurry! We\u2019re running out of time!\nSheldon: Okay.\nBernadette: Just do it!\nSheldon: Oh, God! One, two, three!\nHoward: Trick or treat, bubbeleh.\nSheldon: What? No. You mean this was all a ruse? Oh, how could I be so stu\u2026 (puts hand to forehead. Electrocutes himself).\nScene: Alice\u2019s apartment. Alice and Leonard are kissing.\nLeonard: Damn it, I can\u2019t. I can\u2019t, I can\u2019t do this.\nAlice: Uh, is it my tongue stud? \u2018Cause if that freaks you out, you\u2019re in for a real surprise later on.\nLeonard: No, no, no. I, I can\u2019t do this. Believe me, I really want to.\nAlice: But?\nLeonard: But I kind of have a girlfriend.\nAlice: Are you kidding?\nLeonard: You\u2019re cool with you and me just being friends, right?\nAlice: I don\u2019t believe this.\nLeonard: Wait, I don\u2019t, which part?\nAlice: I\u2019m so stupid. I thought for once I\u2019d met a good guy, but you\u2019re just another jackass.\nLeonard: Oh, no, no, you have it wrong. No. I, I was going to be a jackass, but I stopped myself. I stayed a good guy, so, I\u2019m gonna pass on the sex. But you should know, that\u2019s not a comment on your hotness but on my goodness. That\u2019s kind of my superpower. I\u2019m, like, Captain Good Guy.\nScene: Leonard being ejected into the corridor.\nLeonard: It\u2019s okay. Did the right thing. You idiot!\nScene: The apartment. Leonard is on skype.\nLeonard: Hey, Priya.\nPriya: Hey, sweetheart. How\u2019s it going?\nLeonard: Uh, not so good. We have to talk.\nPriya: Oh, sounds serious. What\u2019s up?\nLeonard: Okay, uh, here it is. I met this girl and I kissed her, and I feel terrible about it. But it\u2019s done, it\u2019s never gonna happen again. And I am so, so sorry.\nPriya: Leonard, relax. It\u2019s okay.\nLeonard: It is?\nPriya: Yeah, these things happen. They happen to everybody.\nLeonard: Oh, my God, you are amazing. I mean, I don\u2019t deserve you. Wh, what do, what do you mean everybody?\nPriya: Leonard, I didn\u2019t know if I should tell you, but I kind of cheated on you, too.\nLeonard: Uh, kind of?\nPriya: A couple of weeks ago, I slept with my ex-boyfriend. So, I guess we both messed up a little.\nLeonard: No, no, I messed up a little. You messed up a lot.\nPriya: Well, it\u2019s not a competition.\nLeonard: Oh yeah, it is, and you won. I, I, I\u2019m, I\u2019m sorry, I have to go. I don\u2019t believe this.\nSheldon (leaping out of the base of the sofa): Bazinga, punk. Now we\u2019re even.\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "2_6": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: A lecture room at the university.\nLeonard: So, if any of you are considering going into experimental physics, my door is always open. Once again, I\u2019m sorry that the demonstration didn\u2019t quite work out, but now we know what happens when you accidentally spill peach Snapple into a helium neon laser. Short answer is\u2026 don\u2019t. And now to tell you about the theoretical physics department is Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Dr. Cooper?\nSheldon (off): Forget it.\nLeonard: Excuse me. Sheldon, we both agreed to do this.\nSheldon (off): It\u2019s a waste of time. I might as well explain the laws of thermodynamics to a bunch of labradoodles.\nLeonard: If you don\u2019t do this, I won\u2019t take you to the comic book store.\nSheldon (entering): Hello. Nice work with the laser, by the way. Looking out at your fresh young faces, I remember when I too was deciding my academic future as a lowly graduate student. Of course, I was 14, and I\u2019d already achieved more than most of you could ever hope to, despite my 9 o\u2019clock bedtime. Now, there may be one or two of you in this room who has what it takes to succeed in theoretical physics, although, it\u2019s more likely that you\u2019ll spend your scientific careers teaching fifth graders how to make paper mache volcanoes with baking soda lava.\nLeonard: Oh, good God.\nSheldon: In short, anyone who told you that you would someday be able to make any significant contribution to physics played a cruel trick on you, a cruel trick indeed. Any questions? Of course not. I weep for the future of science. Now if you\u2019ll excuse me, the latest issue of Batman is out. Come, Leonard.\nLeonard: Laser demonstration\u2019s looking pretty good now, huh?\nCredits sequence. \n\u00a0\nScene: The university cafeteria.\n\u00a0\nRaj: I love this time of the year. The leaves are turning, there\u2019s a bracing chill in the air.\nHoward: Plus there\u2019s a whole new crop of female grad students about to put on just enough winter weight to make them needy and vulnerable. That\u2019s right, honey, have another calzone, Daddy can wait.\nRaj: Isn\u2019t there a university policy against dating graduate students?\nLeonard: No, if you can talk to them, you can ask them out.\nRaj: Damn, there\u2019s always a catch.\nLeslie Winkle (entering): Hey, guys.\nLeonard: Hey, Leslie.\nLeslie: So, dumbass, I heard you made a grad student throw up last night.\nSheldon: The truth can indeed be a finger down the throat of those unprepared to hear it. But why should I cater to second-rate minds?\nLeslie: Because first-rate minds call you \u201cdumbass\u201d?\nSheldon: Oh, yeah? Well\u2026 you\u2019re a mean person.\nGirl (arriving): Excuse me, Dr. Cooper, I\u2019m Ramona Nowitzki, I was at your talk last night. I think you\u2019re just brilliant.\nSheldon: That is the prevailing opinion.\nLeslie: Oh, now I\u2019m gonna throw up.\nHoward: Howard Wolowitz, department of engineering, co-designer of the International Space Station\u2019s Liquid Waste Disposal System.\nRamona: Ew. Dr. Cooper, I\u2019ve read everything you\u2019ve published. I especially liked your paper on grand unification using string-network condensates and was wondering how you determined that three-dimensional string-nets provided a unified picture of fermions and gauge bosons?\nSheldon: Amazing, an intelligent labradoodle.\nHoward: Woof.\nSheldon: The fact is I\u2019m quite close to a breakthrough in showing how neutrinos emerge from a string-net condensate.\nRamona: Oh, my God, that would change the way we view the entire physical universe.\nSheldon: It\u2019s what I do.\nHoward: You know, the Pishkin-Wolowitz Liquid Waste Disposal System is turning a few heads as well.\nRamona: Again, ew. You know, I\u2019d love to hear more about how you intend to add neutrinos. Could we get a cup of coffee sometime?\nSheldon: I don\u2019t drink coffee.\nHoward: I do. I love me a cup of joe.\nRamona: Well, it doesn\u2019t have to be coffee. How about dinner?\nSheldon: I do eat dinner.\nRamona: Great. I know a terrific little Italian place.\nSheldon: I never eat in strange restaurants. One runs the risk of non-standard cutlery.\nRamona: Excuse me?\nLeonard: Sheldon lives in fear of the three-tined fork.\nSheldon: Three tines is not a fork, three tines is a trident. Forks are for eating, tridents are for ruling the seven seas.\nRamona: What if I brought food to your place?\nSheldon: That would be acceptable. On Mondays, I eat Thai food. Mee krob and chicken sate with extra peanut sauce from Siam Palace.\nRamona: You got it. I already have your address.\nSheldon: What a nice girl.\nHoward: Sheldon, do you have any idea what just happened?\nSheldon: Yes. Apparently I\u2019m getting a free dinner.\nScene: The apartment building lobby. Ramona is waiting by the lift. Penny enters. \n\u00a0\nPenny: Oh, yeah, no, this thing\u2019s majorly out of order. (Picking up out of order sign) See? Sorry.\nRamona: That\u2019s okay. Guess I\u2019m taking the stairs.\nPenny: Where you going?\nRamona: 4-A.\nPenny: Oh, are you here to see Leonard?\nRamona: No, Dr. Cooper.\nPenny: Dr. Sheldon Cooper?\nRamona: We\u2019re having dinner.\nPenny: Sheldon Cooper? Tall, thin, looks a little like a giant praying mantis?\nRamona: He is cute, isn\u2019t he?\nPenny: Sheldon Cooper?\nScene: The apartment. Leonard opens the door, Ramona and Penny are outside. \n\u00a0\nRamona: Hi, Leonard.\nLeonard: Hey, Ramona. Come on in.\nRamona: Thanks. Where should I put this?\nLeonard: Uh, the kitchen\u2019s fine. (To Penny) Hey, what are you doing?\nPenny: I need to see this.\nLeonard: Uh-huh. The viewing area\u2019s right over there. Sheldon, your girl\u2026 date\u2026 person\u2026 Ramona\u2019s here.\nSheldon: Oh, hello.\nRamona: Oh, sorry I\u2019m late. I just got so caught up reading the draft of your latest paper.\nSheldon: Did you enjoy the humorous footnote where I illustrate mirror-symmetry by likening it to the Flash playing tennis with himself?\nRamona: So funny. But the idea that you might be able to incorporate gravity, I have to tell you, I found it physically exhilarating.\nSheldon: My hypotheses tend to have that effect.\nRamona: I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t bring enough for your friends. I assumed we were going to be alone.\nLeonard: Oh, yeah. No, we were just going.\nHoward: To watch, right?\nLeonard: No, come on, now, we\u2019re going out.\nPenny: Oh, come on, we\u2019ll be quiet.\nLeonard: Let\u2019s go. Okay, you two, just, have a nice\u2026 whatever this is.\nPenny (in hallway): Okay, you guys, look, I know this is none of my business, but I just, I have to ask, what\u2019s Sheldon\u2019s deal?\nLeonard: What do you mean \u201cdeal\u201d?\nPenny: You know, like what\u2019s his deal? Is it girls? Guys? Sock puppets?\nLeonard: Honestly, we\u2019ve been operating under the assumption that he has no deal.\nPenny: Come on, everybody has a deal.\nHoward: Not Sheldon. Over the years, we\u2019ve formulated many theories about how he might reproduce. I\u2019m an advocate of mytosis.\nPenny: I\u2019m sorry?\nHoward: I believe one day Sheldon will eat an enormous amount of Thai food and split into two Sheldons.\nLeonard: On the other hand, I think Sheldon might be the larval form of his species, and someday he\u2019ll spin a cocoon and emerge two months later with moth wings and an exoskeleton.\nPenny: Okay, well, thanks for the nightmares.\nLeonard: Hey, do you want to hang out with us?\nPenny: What are you guys gonna do?\nLeonard: Uh\u2026\nHoward: My mom\u2019s making a brisket tonight.\nLeonard: The one with the little onions? Mmm.\nPenny: Yeah, I\u2019m busy, so, goodnight.\nHoward: Her loss. Let\u2019s go.\nRaj: Brisket party! B-to-the-R-to-the-I-S-K\u2026 To-the-E-to-the-T\u2026 Ooh\u2026\nLeonard: Don\u2019t.\nScene: The cafeteria.\n\u00a0\nLeonard: Hey, aren\u2019t you having breakfast?\nSheldon: Yes.\nLeonard: Are you experimenting with nutritional suppositories again?\nSheldon: Not in these pants.\nLeonard: So, how\u2019d it go with Ramona last night?\nSheldon: Oh, great. She\u2019s smart, insightful and she has a very unique way of, you know, revering me.\nRamona (arriving): Here\u2019s your spinach mushroom omelette .\nSheldon: Thank you. Did anyone touch it?\nRamona: Gloves were worn by everyone involved. I was vigilant.\nSheldon: Ramona pointed out that I\u2019ve been wasting 20 minutes a day standing on cafeteria lines.\nRamona: Time which would be better spent tackling the great physics problems of our day.\nSheldon: You don\u2019t tackle the big issues, Ramona. You fence with them. En garde. Riposte.\nLeonard: Touche.\nLeslie (arriving): Morning.\nLeonard: Ah, hey Leslie.\nLeslie: So, Sheldon, I see you\u2019re organizing your papers for the Smithsonian Museum of Dumbassery.\nRamona: There won\u2019t be any room until they get rid of the permanent Leslie Winkle exhibit.\nSheldon: Oh, good one.\nLeslie: I see you got a grad student to fight your battles for you. I\u2019ll let you keep your lunch money today.\nRamona: Okay, Dr. Cooper is on the verge of a breakthrough. If you\u2019re going to stay, you\u2019ll have to be respectful and quiet. (Leslie leaves. Ramona looks pointedly at Leonard) \nLeonard: Wait for me.\nRamona: So have you worked out the neutrino issue?\nSheldon: Well, to paraphrase Mozart, all the subatomic particles are there, I just have to put them in the right order.\nRamona: You\u2019re so witty.\nSheldon: Aren\u2019t I?\nScene: The apartment. There is a knock on the door which then opens and Penny enters.\nPenny: Hey, guys, this package came for y\u2026\n(Sheldon is sitting in his usual seat, typing on his laptop. One foot is in a foot spa. Ramona is pumicing the other.)\n\u00a0\nRamona: Dr. Cooper is working.\nSheldon: Yes, I\u2019m close to a breakthrough. Ooh, it tickles\nPenny: Sorry. (Puts package down and leaves. In hallway, shudders)  Holy crap on a cracker.\nLeonard: Hey, Penny.\nPenny: Hi. You know, you probably don\u2019t want to go in there.\nLeonard: Why? What are they doing?\nPenny: You know, the only way I could explain it would be in a therapist\u2019s office with dolls.\nLeonard (enters): Hoo-boy.\nRamona: Dr. Cooper\u2019s working.\nLeonard: Yeah, I can see that. Sheldon, Halo night, Koothrappali\u2019s. You coming?\nSheldon: Oh, yes, it\u2019s Halo night. Let me just dry my tootsies.\nRamona: You\u2019re not going to Halo night.\nSheldon: Yes, I am. It\u2019s Wednesday. Wednesday\u2019s Halo night.</i>\nRamona: Didn\u2019t a great man once say, \u201cScience demands nothing less than the fervent and\nunconditional dedication of our entire lives\u201d?\nSheldon: He did.\nRamona: And who was that great man?\nSheldon: Me. Sorry, Leonard.\nLeonard: Seriously? You\u2019re not coming?\nSheldon: You heard her. How can I argue with me?\nLeonard: Okay, well, once again, you guys have a good\u2026 whatever this is.\nRamona: Dr. Cooper, I have to tell you, your friends are holding you back.\nSheldon: I prefer to think of it as I\u2019m pulling them forward.\nRamona: Halo night? A man with your intellectual gifts doesn\u2019t waste an evening playing video games.\nSheldon: He does on Wednesdays.\nRamona: Not if he wants a Nobel Prize.\nSheldon: He does want that. Does a man with my intellectual gifts play paintball on weekends?\nRamona: What do you think?\nSheldon: Drat.\nRamona: Now shall we get back to work?\nSheldon: I suppose. Battlestar Galactica comes on tonight. (Pause) I guess I can wait for the DVD. (Pause) And then never ever watch it.\nMontage of scenes: To the sound of \u201cYou Can Be My Yoko Ono\u201d by Barenaked Ladies\u00a0 we see 1. the guys set off for paintball while Sheldon, dressed in paintball gear, sadly waves them goodbye, 2. Ramona catch Sheldon hiding behind the shower curtain playing on a Nintendo DS, 3. Ramona remove a book Sheldon is reading to reveal a Batman comic underneath, 4. Sheldon escape the apartment in his paintball gear only to be chased back inside by Ramona returning with groceries, she finds him sitting in his underpants with his paintball helmet still on.\n\u00a0\nScene: Outside Penny\u2019s apartment. \n\u00a0\nSheldon (Knock, knock, knock, in a low voice): Penny, (knock, knock, knock) Penny, (knock, knock, knock) Penny\nPenny: Sheldon, honey, I\u2019ve told you, it\u2019s a small apartment, you only have to knock one time.\nSheldon: Please, please, I don\u2019t have a lot of time. Look, Ramona finally dozed off, and I need you to help me get rid of her.\nPenny: Get rid of her how?\nSheldon: I don\u2019t know, but apparently I\u2019m in some kind of relationship, and you seem to be an expert at ending them.\nPenny: Excuse me?\nSheldon: I see man after man leaving this apartment never to return.\nPenny: Okay, first of all, it is not man after man.\nRamona (off): Dr. Cooper?!\nSheldon: Hide me.\nPenny: Hide you?\nSheldon: I formally request sanctuary.\nRamona: Why aren\u2019t you working?\nSheldon: Um\u2026 she distracted me. I told you, Penny, I don\u2019t have time for your nonsense, I have important things to do.\nPenny: Oh, man.\nRamona: I know what\u2019s going on here.\nPenny: Really? Well, then will you explain it to me?\nRamona: You\u2019re in love with Dr. Cooper.\nPenny: Uh, yeah, no, that\u2019s not it.\nRamona: Don\u2019t try to deny it. He\u2019s a remarkable man, but you have to let him go.\nPenny: Oh, gee, okay.\nRamona: I know it\u2019s hard, but he\u2019s a gift to the whole world, and we can\u2019t be selfish.\nPenny: Yeah, he\u2019s a gift all right.\nRamona: Sisters?\nPenny: Um, sure, sisters. (Ramona leaves.) Holy crap on a cracker.\nScene: Leonard\u2019s bedroom. He is asleep. There is a tapping on the wall. He wakes up.\n\u00a0\nLeonard: Sheldon? (Pause, then more tapping) What are you doing?!\nSheldon: It\u2019s Morse code.\nLeonard: Why?\nSheldon: So we can communicate through the wall.\nLeonard: We are communicating through the wall.\nSheldon: Yes, but the communication is not encrypted.\nLeonard: I don\u2019t know Morse code.\nSheldon: It\u2019s very simple. This is A (knock knock) this is B (knock knock-knock-knock) this is C\u2026\nLeonard: Sheldon, I\u2019m not going to learn Morse code at three o\u2019clock in the morning!\nSheldon: All right.\nLeonard: Don\u2019t come in here, don\u2019t come in here, don\u2019t come in here, don\u2019t (Sheldon enters) Aw! What\u2019s going on?\nSheldon: Shh! Ramona\u2019s sleeping on the couch.\nLeonard: I know. When is she going home?\nSheldon: Never, that\u2019s the problem. I need your help.\nLeonard: What are you talking about?\nSheldon: I\u2019m invoking the Skynet clause of our friendship agreement.\nLeonard: That only applies if you need me to help you destroy an artificial intelligence you created that\u2019s taking over the Earth.\nSheldon: Come on! Don\u2019t nitpick!\nLeonard: Good night.\nSheldon: Shh. All right, I\u2019m invoking our bodysnatchers clause.\nLeonard: The bodysnatchers clause requires me to help you destroy someone we know who\u2019s been replaced with an alien pod.\nSheldon: Yes. She\u2019s in the living room. Go, I\u2019ll wait here.\nRamona (entering): Sheldon, what are you doing out of bed?\nSheldon: Now! Do it!\nRamona: You know you need your sleep in order for your cognitive processing to perform at optimum levels. Now come on.\nSheldon: Godzilla clause?\nLeonard: Not unless she destroys Tokyo.\nSheldon: Rats.\nScene: The living room. Sheldon is surrounded by whiteboards.\n\u00a0\nSheldon (excitedly): I\u2019ve got it! I finally reconciled the black hole information paradox with my theory of string-network condensates!\nRamona: It\u2019s unbelievable! It\u2019s paradigm-altering!\nSheldon: And I could not have done it without you.\nRamona: Oh, please, I just offered a little encouragement.\nSheldon: It was a lot more than that. You helped me work out the masses of all the fermions, and you pumiced my hammer toe. How can I ever repay you?\nRamona: Well, would you consider naming it the Cooper-Nowitzki Theorem?\nSheldon: Who\u2019s Nowitzki?\nRamona: I\u2019m Nowitzki.\nSheldon: Oh, you want me to share credit?\nRamona: Uh-huh.\nSheldon: Get out!\nScene: The hallway, Ramona is leaving.\n\u00a0\nPenny: Oh, hey, hi.\nRamona: Oh, bite me!\nPenny: Sisters?\nScene: The cafeteria. A red haired girl approaches the table. \n\u00a0\nGirl: Excuse me, Dr. Cooper, I\u2019m Kathy O\u2019Brien. I just finished reading your paper reconciling the black hole information paradox with your theory of string-network condensates, and it just took my breath away.\nSheldon: Maybe when I publish it, I\u2019ll include an inhaler.\nKathy: Would you possibly have any time for me to pick your brain?\nSheldon: Let\u2019s see, today\u2019s Thursday. Thursday nights, I eat pizza from Giacomo\u2019s. Sausage, mushrooms, light olives.\nKathy: Great. I\u2019ll bring it to your place. I have the address.\nSheldon: What a nice girl.\nLeonard: Sheldon, do you see what just happened here?\nSheldon: Yes, I\u2019m getting a free pizza. I\u2019m on a roll.\nScene: The living room. The guys are eating.\nSheldon: More Pad Thai, please.\nHoward: Sheldon, you\u2019ve already had four servings.\nRaj: You might want to slow down a bit, buddy.\nSheldon: Just one more bite.\nLeonard: Sheldon? Sheldon, are you okay?\nSheldon: I\u2019m just so\u2026 full.\n(Sheldon begins to shake uncontrollably, then expand, then a second Sheldon separates from the original Sheldon and ends up sitting next to him. Leonard wakes up in bed with a start.)\nLeonard: That\u2019s it. No more Thai food.\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "7_12": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The apartment.\nAmy: This is nice, that we all get to eat together.\nLeonard: Absolutely.\nAmy: Hmm. Can we maybe put the phones down and have an actualhuman conversation?\nSheldon: We can, but thanks to Steve Jobs, we don\u2019t have to.\nPenny: Guys, guys, you\u2019re never gonna believe this.\nLeonard: What happened?\nPenny: I just got a part on a TV show.\nAmy: Congratulations.\nLeonard: What? That\u2019s great. Guys.\nHoward: Oh, yeah\nSheldon: Yay, Penny.\nAmy: What\u2019s the show?\nPenny: Um, NC\u2026 II\u2026 or, you know, NCSTD\u2026 I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s, it\u2019s, you know, it\u2019s the one with the letters and I\u2019m gonna be on it!\nLeonard: That\u2019s amazing.\nPenny: Yeah.\nHoward: What\u2019s your part?\nPenny: Um, I play a customer in a diner and I flirt with Mark Harmon.\nRaj: Ooh, Mark Harmon, he\u2019s a dreamboat.\nLeonard: So it, it\u2019s just flirting?\nPenny: Well, yeah. Why?\nLeonard: Uh, no reason. I just think it\u2019s sexier when things are left to the imagination.\nAmy: He\u2019s wrong.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The Cheesecake Factory.\nRaj: So I read a study that says a man with a dog is three times more likely to get a woman\u2019s phone number.\nLeonard: Is it true even when the man lets his dog lick peanut butter off his tongue?\nRaj: I don\u2019t see why not. \nHoward: If you\u2019re really desperate to meet women and like having food eaten out of your mouth, I could set you up with my mom.\nSheldon: Why is that funny? That\u2019s just unhygienic.\nLeonard: It\u2019s a joke.\nSheldon: I don\u2019t think so. I believe that a joke is a brief oral narrative with a climactic humorous twist. For example, uh, Wolowitz\u2019s mother is so fat that she decided to go on a diet, or exercise, or both. See? The twist is that people don\u2019t usually change. Well, they don\u2019t.\nPenny: Hey, guys, don\u2019t forget, my episode\u2019s on TV tomorrow night.\nHoward: We\u2019ll be there.\nRaj: Can we bring anything?\nPenny: Oh, that\u2019s so sweet of you, but I was gonna steal food from here. You know, my treat.\nSheldon: Wait, if Howard\u2019s mother is coming, then you should also steal marbles. Because she\u2019s obese, and hippos are obese, and in the popular board game Hungry Hungry Hippos, they eat marbles. Maybe I need to dumb these down for you. \nScene: The stairwell.\nSheldon: Leonard, do you think I\u2019m funny?\nLeonard: No. Do you?\nSheldon: I think I\u2019m hysterical.\nLeonard: I take it back. That was funny.\nSheldon: The philosopher Henri Bergson says it\u2019s funny when a human being behaves like an object. \nLeonard: I bet that bit killed at The Chuckle Hut.\nSheldon: Oh, he didn\u2019t perform stand-up comedy, he was a philosopher.\nLeonard: You know, I think we\u2019re zeroing in on your problem.\nSheldon: Perhaps I\u2019ll spend some time developing a unified theory of comedy, which will allow me to elicit laughter from anyone at any time. Unless they\u2019re German, \u2019cause that\u2019s a tough crowd.\nLeonard: Are you set on people laughing with you? \u2018Cause if you\u2019re cool with at you\u2026\nSheldon: I don\u2019t get it.\nScene: Bernadette\u2019s car.\nBernadette: Raj, when you said you were gonna bring a date to watch Penny\u2019s thing tonight, I didn\u2019t think you meant Stuart.\nHoward: Really? I never for a second thought it\u2019d be anything else.\nRaj: I almost met someone last night, but I blew it. I was walking Cinnamon and this girl introduced herself, but she was so cute I panicked and said, wouldn\u2019t it be easier if instead of talking we could just sniff each other\u2019s butts?\nBernadette: Well, Stuart\u2019s cute in his own way.\nStuart: When I was a baby, my mother called me her little possum.\nRaj: Are possums cute?\nStuart: Not at all.\nHoward: If you\u2019re so intimidated by talking to attractive girls, maybe you should practice by talking to regular people.\nRaj: You mean like fatties and uggos?\nBernadette: Or maybe just stop talking.\nHoward: I\u2019m serious. Go to the mall, talk to anybody, practice, that way when you eventually do talk to a cute girl, it won\u2019t be so scary.\nBernadette: Or just keep dating the possum.\nScene: The apartment.\nVoice on television: Parsa doesn\u2019t have those kind of resources.\nSecond voice: No, and that\u2019s why he had Erin Pace rewire it\u2026\nLeonard: I\u2019m so proud of you.\nPenny: We haven\u2019t even gotten to my scene yet.\nLeonard: I know, but you\u2019re going to be a TV star and you haven\u2019t left me yet. That takes guts.\nSheldon: I don\u2019t know about you, but I\u2019m very uncomfortable with all this.\nAmy: Why?\nSheldon: I\u2019ve never seen this show before and now I\u2019m starting with episode 246? It\u2019s unnatural.\nAmy: Just think of the first 245 as the prequel.\nSheldon: All right.\nPenny: Okay, shh, guys, guys, this is it.\nMan on TV: I guess it\u2019s you and me, kid.\nMark Harmon on TV: What are you doing?\nWoman on TV: I\u2019m trying to make peace.\nMark Harmon on TV: We\u2019re good.\nWoman on TV: Good.\nMark Harmon on TV: Really? Because\u2026\nPenny: Are you kidding me?\nLeonard: What\u2019s wrong?\nPenny: Well, the diner scene. Where\u2019s my diner scene?\nSheldon: Well, don\u2019t ask me. Until I see the prequel, I\u2019m lost.\nPenny: No, there was supposed to be a big scene with me and Mark Harmon, but it\u2019s gone.\nBernadette: What happened?\nPenny: They must\u2019ve cut it.\nLeonard: Oh, Penny, I\u2019m, I\u2019m sorry. \nHoward: That stinks.\nRaj: I\u2019m sure you were great.\nPenny: This doesn\u2019t make any sense. I mean, I, I thought I did a, a really good job, I\u2026 Excuse me.\nSheldon: I\u2019ve been studying how to make people laugh. They say that comedy is tragedy plus time. Let\u2019s tickle some ribs.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment.\nPenny (on phone): No, Dad, I don\u2019t think they cut me out of the show because I was too pretty. No, I don\u2019t need you to come out and kick Mark Harmon\u2019s ass. Daddy, I gotta go. I love you. Bye.\nLeonard: How you doing?\nPenny: Ugh, this is such a disaster. My parents had all my relatives over. They got one of those six-foot sandwiches, and got my brother a day pass out of rehab and now he\u2019s missing and the sandwich is missing, and they\u2019re probably in Mexico by now. So humiliating.\nLeonard: You still got the part. That\u2019s a huge accomplishment.\nPenny: Yeah, but this was supposed to be my break, okay? People were gonna see me in this show and it was gonna lead to bigger things. More auditions, more parts. Now none of that\u2019s gonna happen.\nLeonard: Honey, you only had, like, three lines. That wasn\u2019t gonna happen anyway.\nPenny: Unbelievable.\nLeonard: Oh, come on, no, that\u2019s not what I meant.\nPenny: Then what did you mean?\nLeonard: I don\u2019t, look, you know, words don\u2019t always have to mean things.\nPenny: I think you meant that you don\u2019t believe in me.\nLeonard: Nope. Uh, uh, I might not know what I meant, but I know that I didn\u2019t mean that. Not this guy. Oh, no way.\nPenny: I want you, right now, to give me your 100% honest opinion.\nLeonard: Right.\nPenny: Do you think I have what it takes to really make it as an actress?\nLeonard: Yes.\nPenny: So you think I\u2019ll be on TV and in movies and win awards.\nLeonard: Honestly?\nPenny: Yes, honestly.\nLeonard: I don\u2019t.\nPenny: How could you say that?\nLeonard: I don\u2019t know, I got all confused when you said honestly.\nPenny: Oh.\nLeonard: Look, do I think that you are talented and that you are beautiful? Of course I do. But isn\u2019t Los Angeles full of actresses who are just as talented, just as beautiful? All right, look, we\u2019ll come back to that.\nPenny: No, please. Don\u2019t stop, go on. Tell me how I\u2019m gonna be a waitress for the rest of my life.\nLeonard: That is not what I said. Look, I think you\u2019re really good. I truly do. But this is an incredibly hard thing that you\u2019re shooting for. I mean, the odds of anyone becoming a successful actor are like a million to one.\nPenny: Wow, thank you.\nLeonard: Should\u2019ve let Sheldon come.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: This is interesting. Apparently, a key component in some forms of humour is the element of surprise. \nAmy: Well, that makes sense. The prefrontal cortex is responsible for planning and anticipation, and patients with brain lesions on their\u2026\nSheldon: BRAIN LESIONS!\nAmy: Sheldon, you scared me. That wasn\u2019t funny.\nSheldon: Or maybe you have a stick up your prefrontal cortex.\nAmy: Okay, the notion that you can read a few books and come up with a definitive theory of comedy is absurd. I mean, humour is a complex neurological\u2026 (Sheldon drops his trousers) Okay, that\u2019s pretty good.\nSheldon: Excellent.\nScene: The mall.\nStuart: How about her?\nRaj: No. No pretty girls. The point is to talk to regular people and work our way up to pretty girls.\nStuart: Fine. How about that old lady with the walker?\nRaj: That depends. On any level, do you think she\u2019s hot?\nStuart: We\u2019ll find somebody else.\nScene: The apartment. \nSheldon: Kumquat?\nAmy: I guess.\nSheldon: Ointment?\nAmy: Sure.\nSheldon: Now, would you say ointment is more, equal to, or less funny than kumquat?\nAmy: I don\u2019t think I want to go out with you anymore.\nSheldon: Will you please stop joking around? I\u2019m trying to figure this out.\nAmy: Sheldon, how many words are you gonna go through?\nSheldon: All of them.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment. \nPenny: You didn\u2019t get your part cut.\nVoice on TV: All right, baby, here\u2019s the deal.\nPenny: And you didn\u2019t get your part cut. Yep, bunch of old guys rocking out in a band, all with erectile dysfunction, you didn\u2019t get your part cut!\nLeonard: Hey. Can we talk?\nPenny: We can, but the part of Penny might get cut.\nLeonard: That was really crappy of me. What you\u2019re trying to do is hard, but people do make it, and I really do believe you could be one of them.\nPenny: Thank you.\nLeonard: And to show you how much I believe in you, I kind of got you an audition.\nPenny: Are you serious? For what?\nLeonard: The new Star Wars movie.\nPenny: What? How did you manage that?\nLeonard: There\u2019s this thing online, you put yourself on tape and just send it in, anyone can do it.\nPenny: Come on Leonard, this is just a PR stunt.\nLeonard: So? Even if it is, you have a huge advantage because you\u2019re an actual actress. Most of the people doing this are just weirdoes and nerds. Wolowitz sent his in two days ago.\nPenny: Really, let it go.\nLeonard: Look, maybe it is a long shot, but sometimes long shots happen. Luke Skywalker was only given one chance to destroy the Death Star. He had to get a torpedo into an exhaust port that was only two meters wide, but with the help of The Force, he\u2026 wow, I can feel you hating me right now.\nScene: The mall. \nStuart: How about that lady in the sweat suit, speed-walking?\nRaj: Yeah, she seems friendly and easy to\u2026 never mind, she\u2019s gone. You know, maybe talking to people is too hard.\nStuart: We could go over to that department store, practice on the mannequins.\nRaj: I don\u2019t know. They\u2019re dressed very stylishly. They\u2019re probably stuck-up. This is ridiculous. The next person that walks by, no matter who it is, they\u2019re the one. We\u2019re gonna die here.\nScene: The Cheesecake Factory.\nAmy: Hello.\nBernadette: Hey.\nHoward: Where\u2019s Sheldon?\nAmy: He\u2019s home trying to use science to determine the basis of humour.\nBernadette: That\u2019s interesting.\nAmy: It\u2019s exhausting. Do you have any idea how hard it is to laugh at a knock-knock joke that starts with knock-knock-knock, Amy, knock-knock-knock, Amy, knock-knock-knock, Amy?\nBernadette: If you want him to stop, sometimes the easiest thing to do is just fake a laugh.\nHoward: Fake a laugh? Do you ever do that with me?\nBernadette: No, of course not.\nHoward: Well, I\u2019d be able to tell anyway.\nBernadette: I don\u2019t think you would.\nHoward: Please, I\u2019ve made plenty of girls laugh, sometimes just by asking them out. (Bernadette laughs uncontrollably) Yeah? Well, I fake my orgasms.\nScene: The apartment. \nLeonard (on phone): Yes, how much for a hundred long-stemmed red roses? Really? How much for three?\nPenny: Hey.\nLeonard: Yeah, I\u2019ll call you back.\nPenny: Look, I know you were just trying to help with your Star Wars thing. I didn\u2019t mean to call it idiotic.\nLeonard: Well, I don\u2019t think you called it idiotic.\nPenny: Oh. Sorry, I meant to. Anyway, um, I was just upset with myself. I wasn\u2019t mad at you. I just feel like everything is falling apart.\nLeonard: Come on. It\u2019s okay.\nPenny: No, it\u2019s not okay. Look at me, okay? I took a temp job as a waitress forever ago, and I\u2019m still doing it. I can\u2019t quit, because guess what? I can\u2019t do anything else. And I finally get my big break, and it goes away. I\u2019m such a mess.\nLeonard: No, you\u2019re not.\nPenny: Really? \u2018Cause this morning at Starbucks, a pair of old underwear fell out of my pant leg. And it wasn\u2019t the only one in there.\nLeonard: Okay, listen to me, this is just a minor setback.\nPenny: No, it\u2019s not, okay? I\u2019ve been out here for, like, ten years. I\u2019ve nothing to show for it.\nLeonard: Well, you have me.\nPenny: You\u2019re right. I do have you. Mm. Let\u2019s get married.\nLeonard: What?\nPenny: Ooh. Leonard Hofstadter, will you marry me?\nLeonard: Um\u2026\nPenny: Did you seriously just say um?\nLeonard: Look, you know I love you but, but you\u2019re, you\u2019re drunk and sad and feeling lost.\nPenny: Okay, so, so you don\u2019t want to marry me?\nLeonard: That is not what I said.\nPenny: No, forget it. I take it back. Offer\u2019s off the table.\nSheldon: Who\u2019s in the mood to laugh?\nLeonard: Really not a good time.\nSheldon: But I used science to construct the perfect joke.\nPenny: I\u2019m gonna go.\nLeonard: Penny, don\u2019t.\nPenny: No, no, I just need to be alone.\nSheldon: So, a sandwich, a rabbi and yo mama walk into a bar. Where are you going?\nLeonard: To my room.\nSheldon: Should I follow you?\nLeonard: No.\nSheldon: Leonard, wait.\nLeonard: What?\nSheldon: I forgot to tell you the sandwich is promiscuous.\nScene: The mall.\nStuart: How about those guys on that bench over there? They look pathetic. I bet we could talk to them.\nRaj: That\u2019s a mirror.\nStuart: Oh, yeah.\nSecurity Guard: Hey, fellas, mall\u2019s closing.\nRaj: Sorry.\nSecurity Guard: Yeah. Good night.\nRaj: Uh, excuse me. \nSecurity Guard: Yeah?\nRaj: Uh, do, do you like being a mall security guard?\nSecurity Guard: It\u2019s all right.\nRaj: Okay, nice talking to you.\nStuart: Smooth.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Can\u2019t sleep?\nLeonard: No.\nSheldon: Would you like to talk about it?\nLeonard: Penny proposed, and I didn\u2019t say yes.\nSheldon: Why not?\nLeonard: That\u2019s a good question.\nSheldon: Does that mean the relationship is over?\nLeonard: I don\u2019t know.\nSheldon: Why don\u2019t you ask her?\nLeonard: Because I\u2019m afraid to know the answer.\nSheldon: Well, I\u2019m sorry.\nLeonard: That\u2019s it? You\u2019re not gonna make some dumb joke or some inappropriate comment?\nSheldon: No. You\u2019re my friend, and, I\u2019m sorry.\nLeonard: Did you just put a kick me sign on my back?\nSheldon: No. That wouldn\u2019t be funny at all.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s bedroom.\nHoward: Star Wars audition, take one, starring Howard Joel Wolowitz, real-life astronaut. Vader is here, now, on this moon. I felt his presence. He\u2019s come for me. He can feel when I\u2019m near\u2026\nBernadette: How many times do I have to tell you to replace the toilet paper when it\u2019s empty?\nHoward: I\u2019m in the middle of something.\nBernadette: So am I.\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "1_12": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The University cafeteria. \nSheldon: Here\u2019s the problem with teleportation.\nLeonard: Lay it on me. \nSheldon: Assuming the device could be invented which would identify the quantum state of matter of an individual in one location, and transmit that pattern to a distant location for reassembly, you would not have actually transported the individual. You would have destroyed him in one location, and recreated him in another.\nLeonard: How about that. \nSheldon: Personally, I would never use a transporter. Because the original Sheldon would have to be disintegrated in order to create a new Sheldon.\nLeonard: Would the new Sheldon be in any way an improvement on the old Sheldon? \nSheldon: No, he would be exactly the same. \nLeonard: That is a problem. \nSheldon: So, you see it too.\nDr Gablehouser (arriving): Dr Hofstadter, Dr Cooper. \nTogether: Dr Gablehouser.\nGablehouser: Gentlemen, I\u2019d like you to meet Dennis Kim. Dennis is a highly sought after Doctorial candidate and we\u2019re hoping to have him do his graduate work here. \nLeonard: Graduate work, very impressive.\nGablehouser: And he\u2019s only fifteen years old.\nSheldon: Not bad, I myself started graduate school at fourteen.\nDennis: Well, I lost a year while my family was tunnelling out of North Korea. \nLeonard: Advantage Kim. \nGablehouser: I thought maybe you boys could show Dennis around, let him see why we\u2019re the best physics research facility in the country.\nDennis: I already know you\u2019re not. You don\u2019t have an open science grid computer, or a free electron laser, and the string theory research being done here is nothing but a dead end. \nSheldon: Excuse me, that is my research, and it is by no means a dead end.\nDennis: Well, obviously you don\u2019t see it yet, but trust me, you will.\nGablehouser: Dennis, we discussed this, we\u2019re in the process of updating our equipment, and we welcome your input on our research goals, and we\u2019ve agreed to look the other way if you want to use up to 20% of the grant money you attract to smuggle your grandfather out of Pyongyang. We want him here boys, make it happen.\nLeonard: Yes sir. \nSheldon: You can count on us, we\u2019re on it. What the hell do you mean, dead end. \nDennis: I mean, the whole landscape of false vacuums in string theory could be as large as ten to the five-hundredth power. In addition\u2026 ooh, look, chocolate milk. \nSheldon: I sense a disturbance in the force. \nLeonard (in a Yoda voice): A bad feeling I have about this, mmm-hmmm. \nCredits sequence\nScene: A corridor.\nLeonard: So, Dennis, how long have you been in America.\nDennis: A year and a half.\nLeonard: No kidding, you speak English really well.\nDennis: So do you. Except for your tendency to end sentences with prepositions. \nLeonard: What are you talking about? \nDennis: That. \nSheldon: He\u2019s not wrong. Alright, and this is my office.\nDennis: Is this part of the tour? \nSheldon: Nope. Goodbye. \nLeonard: Come on, Sheldon, we\u2019ve hardly shown him anything.\nSheldon: Oh, alright, this is my desk, these are my books, this is my door, please close it behind you. Goodbye. \nDennis: Looks like you\u2019re doing work in quantum loop corrections.\nSheldon: Keen observation, goodbye. \nDennis: You see where you went wrong, don\u2019t you? \nSheldon: Leonard.\nLeonard: Huh, yeah? \nSheldon: Get him out. \nLeonard: Come on, Dennis, I\u2019ll show you the rec centre, they\u2019ve got nautilus equipment.\nDennis: Do I look like I lift weights. \nLeonard: Not heavy ones. \nDennis: It\u2019s startling to me you haven\u2019t considered a Lorentz invariant field theory approach.\nSheldon: You think I haven\u2019t considered it? You really think I haven\u2019t considered it? \nDennis: Have you considered it?\nSheldon: Get him out Leonard.\nLeonard: Come on, Dennis, I\u2019ll show you the radiation lab.\nDennis: Wow, you won the Stephenson award.\nSheldon: Yes, in fact I am the youngest person ever to win it. \nDennis: Really, how old?\nSheldon: Fourteen and a half.\nDennis: You were the youngest person ever to win it. \nLeonard: It\u2019s like looking into an obnoxious little mirror, isn\u2019t it? \nScene: The living room of the apartment.\nPenny (to Raj): Mmm, this is really delicious, isn\u2019t it? (Raj looks uncomfortable, then nods.) Still can\u2019t talk to me unless you\u2019re drunk, huh? (Shakes head) Oh, sweetie, you are so damaged. \nHoward: Hey, I\u2019m damaged too. How about a hug for Howie? \nPenny: Sure. Raj, hug Howard. \nSheldon (dramatically): Uh-uh-uh. \nLeonard: Something you\u2019d like to share? A tale of woe perhaps.\nSheldon: Fifteen years old. Dennis Kim is fifteen years old, and he\u2019s already correcting my work. Today I went from being Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart to\u2026 you know, that other guy.\nHoward: Antonio Salieri?\nSheldon: Oh, God, now even you\u2019re smarter than me.\nHoward: You know, Sheldon, you don\u2019t have so many friends that you can afford to start insulting them. \nLeonard: Just eat, Sheldon, you\u2019ll feel better. \nSheldon: Why waste food. In Texas when a cow goes dry they don\u2019t keep feeding it, they just take her out and shoot her between the eyes. \nPenny: I\u2019m confused, did Sheldon stop giving milk? \nLeonard: You can\u2019t let this kid get to you. You always knew that someday someone would come along who was younger and smarter.\nSheldon: Yes, but I assumed I would have been dead hundreds of years, and that there would be an asterisk by his name because he would be a cyborg. \nPenny: So, you\u2019ve got a bit of competition, I really don\u2019t see what the big deal is. \nSheldon: Well of course you don\u2019t, you\u2019ve never excelled at anything. \nPenny: I don\u2019t understand, exactly how did he get any friends in the first place? \nHoward: We liked Leonard.\nLeonard: Well, what are you going to do, Sheldon, give up?\nSheldon: Yes. That\u2019s what a rational person does when his entire life\u2019s work is invalidated by a post-pubescent Asian wunderkind. He ceases his fruitless efforts, he donates his body to scientific research, and he waits to die. \nPenny: You know, I\u2019m confused again, is he waiting, or do we get to shoot him between the eyes?\nScene: The same, later that night\nSheldon: Hey.\nLeonard: Hey.\nSheldon: I\u2019ve decided you\u2019re right. My career is not over. \nLeonard: Great.\nSheldon: But, since the arrival of Dennis Kim has rendered my research pointless, I just have to find something else to focus on.\nLeonard: Great.\nSheldon: So I\u2019ve decided, I\u2019m going to collaborate with you.\nLeonard: Great. \nSheldon: What exactly is it you do? I know you chatter on about it all the time, but I\u2019ve never really paid attention.\nLeonard: Okay, well, right now I\u2019m designing an experiment to study the soft component of cosmic radiation at sea-level, but I really don\u2019t need any help. \nSheldon: Oh, sure you do. Now, see, what\u2019s this here in the schematic, is that a laser array?\nLeonard: Yes.\nSheldon: No. Hmmm. What happens if you use argon lasers instead of helium neon?\nLeonard: It would blow up.\nSheldon: Are you sure? \nLeonard: Pretty sure.\nSheldon: Pretty sure\u2019s not very scientific, is this how you normally work, just hunches and guesses and stuff?\nLeonard: Okay, Sheldon, I understand that you\u2019re going through a bit of a career crisis, you\u2019re searching for some other area where you can feel valuable and productive but I need to tell you something and I want you to listen carefully. \nSheldon: Alright.\nLeonard: Go away.\nSheldon: If you\u2019re concerned about sharing credit with me, you\u2019re name can go first\u2026 I\u2019m going. \nScene: Howard\u2019s lab.\nHoward (into phone): It\u2019s a small brown paper bag, Ma, I\u2019m looking at it right now. (Pause.) Why would I make that up, there\u2019s no ding-dong in it. (Pause.) How are two ding-dongs tomorrow going to help me today? \nSheldon (entering): So, this is engineering, huh? \nHoward (into phone): I\u2019ll talk to you later. \nSheldon: Engineering. Where the noble semi-skilled labourers execute the vision of those who think and dream. Hello, oompah-loompahs of science.\nHoward: Sheldon, what are you doing here?\nSheldon: I just came by to say hello.\nHoward: I\u2019ve been at this lab for three years, you\u2019ve never came by to say hello.\nSheldon: Well, up until now I\u2019ve had better things to do. So, what are we making today? \nHoward: A small payload support structure for a European science experimental package that\u2019s going up on the next space shuttle. \nSheldon: Really, how does it work?\nHoward: When this is done, it will be attached to the payload bay, and the sensor apparatus will rest on it. \nSheldon: Uh, huh. So it\u2019s a shelf? \nHoward: No, you don\u2019t understand, during acceleration it needs to stay perfectly level and provide\u2026 yeah, okay, it\u2019s a shelf. \nSheldon: Now, I notice you\u2019re using titanium, did you give any consideration to carbon nanotubes, they\u2019re lighter, cheaper and half twice the tensile strength.\nHoward: Sheldon, there\u2019s a diploma in my office that says I have a masters in engineering.\nSheldon: And you also have a note from your mother that says I love you, bubbula. But neither of those is a cogent argument for titanium over nanotubes. \nHoward: Sheldon.\nSheldon: Yes.\nHoward: Go away. \nSheldon: Did Leonard tell you to say that? \nHoward: No, I thought of it all by myself. \nSheldon: Huh. It can\u2019t be a coincidence. There must be some causal link I\u2019m missing.\nScene: Raj is exiting his office.\nRaj: Go away. (Sheldon exits)\nSheldon: Curiouser and curiouser. \nScene: The apartment.\nHoward (entering): Is he here? \nLeonard: If he were, I wouldn\u2019t be. \nRaj: Do you know what he did. He watched me work for ten minutes, and then started to design a simple piece of software that could replace me. \nLeonard: Is that even possible?\nRaj: As it turns out, yes.\nHoward: Something\u2019s got to be done about him, Leonard.\nLeonard: Like what? He\u2019ll never be able to cope with the fact that some fifteen year-old kid is smarter and more accomplished than he is. \nRaj: Well, what if something were to happen to this boy so he was no longer a threat to Sheldon?\nHoward: Then our problem would be solved. \nLeonard: Hang on, are we talking about murdering Dennis Kim? I\u2019m not saying no. \nHoward: We don\u2019t have to go that far, there are other means available.\nRaj: We can\u2019t send him back to North Korea. He knows how to get out. \nHoward: The only thing we need to do is make this Kim kid lose his focus.\nLeonard: That won\u2019t happen, he\u2019s not interested in anything but physics.\nHoward: What about biology? \nLeonard: What?\nHoward: You know, biology? The one thing that can completely derail a world class mind. \nLeonard: Howard, he\u2019s fifteen.\nHoward: Yeah, so, when I was fifteen I met Denise Polmerry and my grade point average fell from a 5.0 to a 1.8. \nRaj: She was sleeping with you?\nHoward: No, I just wasted a lot of time thinking about what it would be like if she did. \nSheldon (entering): Oh, good, you\u2019re all here. Look, I\u2019ve decided that if the three of you drop whatever it is you\u2019re working on and join me, we could lick cold fusion in less than a decade, twelve years tops. (They stare at him.) Go away? (They nod) Hmm. Could it be me? \nScene: Outside Penny\u2019s apartment. \nPenny (opening door): Oh, hey guys, what\u2019s up?\nHoward: We need a hot fifteen year-old Asian girl with a thing for smart guys. \nPenny: What?\nLeonard: Howard, that\u2019s racist, any fifteen year-old girl will do the trick. (Penny slams door.)\nRaj: It\u2019s possible she may have misunderstood us. \nScene: Sheldon\u2019s office. He is making measurements on maps. There is a knock on the door. \nGablehouser (entering): Dr Cooper? Oh, are we interrupting?\nSheldon: No, no, please, come in. Yeah, I think you\u2019ll appreciate this, very exciting.\nGablehouser: Oh, what are you working on?\nSheldon: Something remarkable. Since my prospects for the Nobel Prize in physics have disappeared, thank you very much, I\u2019ve decided to refocus my efforts and use my people skills to win the Nobel Peace Prize. Look, I\u2019m going to solve the Middle-East Crisis by building an exact replica of Jerusalem in the middle of the Mexican desert. \nGablehouser: To what end?\nSheldon: You know, it\u2019s like the baseball movie, build it and they will come. \nGablehouser: Who will come?\nSheldon: The Jewish people.\nGablehouser: What if they don\u2019t come.\nSheldon: We\u2019ll make it nice, put out a spread. \nGablehouser: Okay, well, um, speaking of spreads, we\u2019re having a small welcoming party this afternoon for Mr Kim, who\u2019s agreed to join us here at the University.\nSheldon: Of course he has, the oracle told us little Neo was the one. You can see the Matrix, can\u2019t you.\nGablehouser: Okay, well, uh, obviously you\u2019re very busy with your\u2026 uh, um, come Dennis. You\u2019ll have to excuse Dr Cooper, he\u2019s been under a lot of\u2026 um\u2026 he\u2019s nuts. \nSheldon (voice off, sings to a Mexican tune): Ah, la-la-la, Hava Nagila. They\u2019ll come, they\u2019ll settle and I\u2019ll win the prize\u2026\nScene: The welcoming party\nSheldon: I really don\u2019t understand your objections, Professor Goldfarb, why wouldn\u2019t the Senoran Desert make a perfectly good promised land?\nGoldfarb: Go away. \nSheldon: We could call it Nuevo Cherusalem. \nGoldfarb: Please go away. \nSheldon: Said Pharoah to Moses. \nGablehouser: Why are all these young women here?\nLeonard: It\u2019s take your daughter to work day. \nGablehouser: Really, I was not aware of that. \nRaj: Oh, yes. There was a very official email that was sent to everyone whose insurance files indicated they had daughters between the ages of 14 and 16. \nGablehouser: Hm?\nHoward: Smooth.\nRaj: Thank you. \nGablehouser: There\u2019s the man of the hour. \nLeonard: Okay, so we now have a socially awkward genius in a room full of attractive age-appropriate women. \nHoward: All he has to do now is hook up with one of them. (The look at Dennis, who is picking his ear.)\nLeonard: Does anyone else see the flaw in this plan?\nRaj: We need a social catalyst.\nLeonard: Like what? We can\u2019t get fifteen year-old girls drunk. \u00a0\nHoward: Or can we?\nLeonard: No, we can\u2019t. \nHoward: I don\u2019t think you mean we can\u2019t. I think you mean we shouldn\u2019t. \nSheldon: Hey, Howard. You\u2019re a Jew. If there was another wailing wall, exactly like the one in Jerusalem, but close to taco stands and cheap prescription drugs, would you still be able to wail at it? Okay, it\u2019s definitely me. \nLeonard: Okay, we cannot leave this to chance, lets pick a girl, and figure out how to get her together with Dennis. \nRaj: Okay. How about that one.\nHoward: Uh-uh. I know the type, cheerleader, student council, goes out with jocks, won\u2019t even look at anybody in the gifted programme. And if, after two years of begging, she does agree to go out with you, it turns out to be a set-up and you\u2019re in the back seat of your mom\u2019s car with your pants off while the whole football team laughs at you.\nRaj: Are you crying?\nHoward: No, I have allergies. \nRaj: Okay, uh, how about her? \nLeonard: Sure. If he wants to spend a couple of years doing her homework while she drinks herself into a stupor with non-fat White Russians, while you\u2019re the one holding her head out of the toilet while she\u2019s puking and telling you she wishes more guys were like you, and they she gets into Cornell because you wrote her essay for her, and you drive up to visit her one weekend and she acts like she doesn\u2019t even know you. \nRaj: Okay, so not her either. How about her?\nHoward: Interesting, kind of pretty, a little chubby so probably low self-esteem. \nLeonard: I think that\u2019s our girl. One of us should go talk to her. \nRaj: I can\u2019t talk to her, you do it. \nLeonard: I can\u2019t just go up and talk to her. Howard, you talk to her. \nHoward: Oh no, she\u2019ll never go for the kid once she gets a peek at this. \nRaj: You know, if we were in India this would be simpler. Five minutes with her dad, twenty goats and a laptop and we\u2019d be done.\nLeonard: Well, we\u2019re not in India. \nRaj: Alright, why don\u2019t we do it your way then? We\u2019ll arrange for this girl to move in across the hall from Dennis so he can pathetically moon over her for months on end.\nLeonard: Okay, that was uncalled for.\nRaj: You started it, dude. \nGablehouser: Could I have everyone\u2019s attention please. What a wonderful occasion this is. And how fortunate that it should happen to fall on take your daughter to work day. We\u2019re here to welcome Mr Dennis Kim to our little family.\nSheldon (sarcastically): Welcome Dennis Kim. \nGablehouser: Mr Kim was not only the valedictorian at Stamford University, he is also the youngest recipient of the prestigious Stephenson Award.\nSheldon: Youngest till the cyborgs rise up! \nGablehouser: And now, without any further ado, let me introduce the man of the hour, Mr Dennis Kim. Dennis! Dennis!\nDennis: What? \nGablehouser: Would you like to tell us a little bit about your upcoming research.\nDennis: Um, no thanks. I\u2019m going to the mall with Emma. \nGablehouser: Well, uh, well, uh\u2026.\nLeonard: The kid got a girl. \nRaj: Unbelievable.\nHoward: Did anyone see how he did it?\nSheldon (to Gablehouser): Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ve got this. Ladies and Gentlemen, honoured daughters. While Mr Kim, by virtue of his youth and naivety, has fallen prey to the inexplicable need for human contact, let me step in and assure you that my research will go on uninterrupted, and that social relationships will continue to baffle and repulse me. Thank you. \nHoward: He\u2019s back.\nLeonard: Yeah, mission accomplished. \nRaj: Forget the mission, how did that little yutz get a girl on his own?\nHoward: I guess times have changed since we were young. Smart is the new sexy. \nLeonard: Well, why do we go home alone every night, we\u2019re still smart. \nRaj: Maybe we\u2019re too smart. So smart it\u2019s offputting. \nHoward: Yeah, let\u2019s go with that. \nScene: The park. The four guys are carrying remote control rockets.\nHoward: Unbelievable. Components I built are on the International Space Station, and I get a ticket for launching a model rocket in the park. \nLeonard: I don\u2019t know if the ticket was so much for the launch as it was for you telling the policewoman \u201cyou have to frisk me, I have a rocket in my pants.\u201d\nRaj: Hey, look at that. (There is a group of youngsters on the grass, laying about. One is playing a guitar. Dennis Kim is among them. He is drinking something from a bottle in a brown paper bag.) It\u2019s Dennis Kim.\nHoward: Wow, I almost didn\u2019t recognise him.\nRaj: You know, I kind of feel bad about what we did to him. (Dennis is now snogging the face off Emma)\nLeonard: Yeah, we really ruined his life. \nSheldon: Screw him, he was weak. \nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "4_22": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: A public washroom. Amy and Penny are in cubicles, Bernadette is washing her hands.\nAmy: I must say, Penny, this is great fun.\nPenny: Glad you\u2019re enjoying yourself.\nAmy: Until I met you and Bernadette, my trips to the bathroom had been entirely focused on elimination. Now they have a delightful social aspect.\nBernadette: Amy, you must\u2019ve been in the bathroom with other women before.\nAmy: Of course I have. But they were strangers and seemed off-put when I engaged in friendly stall-to-stall chit-chat.\nBernadette: Some women don\u2019t like to get chummy when their panties are down.\nAmy: You okay in there, bestie?\nPenny: I\u2019m fine.\nAmy: The reason I ask is that many people experience bladder shyness, the inability to pass urine\nPenny: Yeah, I said I\u2019m fine. Stop talking to me.\nAmy: She always this crabby when she urinates?\nBernadette: We\u2019re really not that close.\nPenny: Screw it. I\u2019ll go later.\nAmy: And I\u2019ll be right by your side.\nScene: A shoe shop. \nBernadette: Did I tell you Priya invited me and Howard to have dinner with her and Leonard?\nPenny: Oh, that\u2019s nice.\nAmy: No, it\u2019s not. It\u2019s a strategic manoeuvre. Leonard\u2019s new girlfriend is testing Bernadette\u2019s loyalty to you and the group. That bitch is crafty.\nBernadette: You think?\nAmy: Of course. How does the cheetah attack a herd of wildebeests? By going after its weakest member.\nBernadette: Well, what makes me the weakest member?\nAmy: Your trusting nature coupled with your teeny-tiny body. You wouldn\u2019t last a minute on the Serengeti.\nPenny: Okay, Amy, you\u2019re being silly. I am not concerned about who hangs out with who. And I certainly don\u2019t have a problem with Leonard\u2019s new girlfriend who wears way too much makeup. Ooh, these are cute. Of course if I buy them, I\u2019ll have to rent my womb out to a gay couple.\nBernadette: It doesn\u2019t matter. I\u2019m going to tell her we can\u2019t make it.\nAmy: Oh, no. You have to go.\nBernadette: I don\u2019t understand. I thought I was a teeny-tiny wildebeest.\nAmy: You are, with hair that smells like strawberries. And we\u2019re going to use that to our advantage.\nPenny: Wait. What are you talking about?\nAmy: By accepting the invitation, Bernadette becomes a double agent inside the enemy camp. She could ferret out Priya\u2019s tactics, identify her weaknesses and feed her false information, such as, Leonard\u2019s no stranger to back-alley cockfights.\nBernadette: I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not a very good liar. They kind of whup that out of you in Catholic school.\nAmy: Don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll teach you. I did two years of Cub Scouts before they found out I was a girl.\nPenny: Okay, I don\u2019t know you people. I\u2019m just an innocent woman wondering if this shoe store will take my Texaco card.\nAmy: How do you feel about concealing a recording device in the cleavage of your ample bosom?\nBernadette: I don\u2019t want anything in my ample bosom.\nAmy: Come on, Strawberries. Take one for the team.\nCredits sequence \nLeonard: Okay, see you later.\nSheldon: Good news. I finally have a handle on my idea for three-person chess.\nLeonard: That is good news. Bye.\nSheldon: Uh, do you know how I solved the balanced centre combat-area problem? Five words, transitional quadrilateral to triangular tessellation.\nLeonard: That, that\u2019s brilliant.\nSheldon: It\u2019s what I do. But wait, there\u2019s more. I also invented two new chess pieces. The serpent, and the old woman.\nLeonard: Okay, now I have to ask. What do they do?\nSheldon: When the serpent slithers to an opposing player\u2019s piece, that piece is considered poisoned and will die after two more moves. Ugh.\nLeonard: All right.\nSheldon: Unless, it gets to the old woman in time, in which case she sucks out the poison, turning her into the Grand Empress, a piece combining the power of the knight, queen and serpent.\nLeonard: Elegant.\nSheldon: That\u2019s because it\u2019s simple.\nLeonard: Okay, well, I look forward to playing with you.\nSheldon: And\u2026\nLeonard: And what?\nSheldon: And a third person. It\u2019s three-person chess. I must say, ever since you started having regular intercourse, your mind has lost its keen edge. You should reflect on that.\nLeonard: Excuse me, but Einstein had a pretty busy sex life.\nSheldon: Yes, and he never unified gravity with the other forces. If he hadn\u2019t been such a hound dog, we\u2019d all have time machines.\nLeonard: Got it. Bye.\nSheldon: You know I\u2019m right.\nLeonard (outside apartment): I think he\u2019s getting worse.\nAmy: Oh, my metatarsal are barking.\nLeonard: You okay?\nAmy: Yeah, yeah. I\u2019m just breaking in some new shoes.\nLeonard: Very pretty.\nAmy: Thank you. Did you know that women wear high heels to make the buttocks and breasts more prominent?\nLeonard: Hadn\u2019t really thought about it.\nAmy: Look.\nLeonard: Uh, sure. Very\u2026 prominent.\nAmy: Please, Leonard, don\u2019t leer, you have a girlfriend.\nLeonard: Sorry.\nAmy: So, are you off to dinner with Priya, Howard and Bernadette?\nLeonard: Yeah. How did you know?\nAmy: I heard it at the mall, when I was shopping with my girlfriends, \u2019cause, you know, that\u2019s kind of my life now. Have a good night. Try not to ogle my caboose as I walk away.\nScene: Raj\u2019s apartment.\nPriya: Hey, you.\nLeonard: Hi. Hey, Raj, will you be joining us for dinner?\nRaj: The lonely guy and the two happy couples? I\u2019d rather get a prostate exam from a leper who walks away with nine fingers.\nPriya: Oh, would you please stop feeling sorry for yourself?\nRaj: I have to feel sorry for myself. I\u2019m the only one who cares. Just like I\u2019m the only one who\u2019ll have sex with me.\nLeonard: Really? In front of your sister?\nPriya: We shared a room growing up. This is not news to me.\nRaj: Excuse me. I\u2019m going to go wander the streets alone. Invisible, unwanted and unloved, a pathetic shadow in a city with no heart. (Leaves, then returns a moment later) I forgot my windbreaker. It\u2019s chilly.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment. \nAmy: I don\u2019t understand. Is this a way to break in new shoes?\nPenny: No. Once these puppies touch the ground they\u2019re mine, and I\u2019ll have to wear them walking up and down Hollywood Boulevard in order to pay them off. Pretty, pretty, pretty.\nAmy: Good news: the wildebeest is in the curry.\nPenny: The what?\nAmy: Bernadette is with Priya and Leonard. Message received. Commence operation \u201cPriya Wouldn\u2019t Wanna Be-ya.\u201d\nPenny: Hey. Seriously? Didn\u2019t you get enough of this cliquey crap in high school?\nAmy: I wish. A clique requires friends. I didn\u2019t have any.\nPenny: None?\nAmy: I used to take my lunch down to the maintenance room and eat with the janitor. It was nice until his wife called me a puta and made me stop. Hang on. It\u2019s the wildebeest. Priya just made a snide comment about your acting career.\nPenny: Wh\u2026 What the hell did she say?\nAmy: She thinks it\u2019s cool you\u2019re following your dream, no matter what.\nPenny: That bitch!\nAmy: How do you want to handle it?\nPenny: Um, okay. Tell Bernadette to tell Priya that I\u2019m on my way to Prague to shoot a movie with Angelina Jolie.\nAmy: Got it. Is it going to be in 3-D?\nPenny: What? I don\u2019t know. It doesn\u2019t matter.\nAmy: I\u2019m gonna say 3-D. That\u2019ll let her know the studio has faith in it.\nScene: Raj\u2019s apartment.\nLeonard: You\u2019re kidding. 3-D?\nBernadette: That\u2019s what I hear.\nHoward: Then the studio must have real faith in it.\nLeonard: Wonder why she didn\u2019t tell me.\nPriya: Have you been spending time with your ex-girlfriend?\nLeonard: No.\nPriya: Then why are you surprised she didn\u2019t tell you?\nLeonard: Well, it\u2019s not as much surprised as, uh, uh, you know, uh. th-th-th-the other thing.\nPriya: What other thing?\nLeonard: Well, you know, if you, if, if, if you, uh, I don\u2019t, oh, what\u2019s the word I\u2019m looking for?\nHoward: I\u2019m not going to help you. This is hilarious.\nBernadette: She\u2019s also dating an astronaut.\nPriya: Wow. That\u2019s very impressive.\nBernadette: Yeah. But Leonard\u2019s impressive, too.\nLeonard: Thank you. Befuddled. The word I was looking for was befuddled.\nScene: The apartment. Sheldon is playing three person chess by himself. \nSheldon: Knight to old woman six-and-a-third. Brilliant move. Thank you. (Knock on door) Will the two of you excuse me?\nRaj: I need a hug.\nSheldon: Sorry, I have company.\nRaj: Come on, Sheldon, open the door.\nSheldon: I don\u2019t want to hug you.\nRaj: I don\u2019t want to hug you, either. I was just feeling blue.\nSheldon: Blue, as in depressed.\nRaj: Well, not so much depressed as lonely.\nSheldon: I don\u2019t know what colour lonely is.\nRaj: What?\nSheldon: Red is angry, yellow is frightened, green is jealous and blue is depressed. Perhaps we can assign a colour to lonely.\nRaj: Nothing rhymes with orange. It\u2019s probably lonely.\nSheldon: All right. Come in. You look positively orange with loneliness. No, I don\u2019t see that catching on at all.\nRaj: What are you doing?\nSheldon: I\u2019m working on my three-person chess game.\nRaj: Oh, cool. Can I play?\nSheldon: It\u2019s three-person chess. Did you bring a friend?\nRaj: No.\nSheldon: Then as a mental exercise I invite you to figure out why the two of us can\u2019t play three-person chess. Can you believe this guy? Social protocol does, however, require me to bring you a hot beverage in your time of need.\nRaj: No, thank you. I\u2019m fine.\nSheldon: It\u2019s not optional. We\u2019re out of tea. I hope you like bouillon.\nRaj: I, uh, I guess you\u2019re probably wondering what\u2019s got me down.\nSheldon: Actually, I was wondering if I could add a third new chess piece. How do you think people would feel about Prince Joey, the king\u2019s feeble-minded but well-meaning cousin?\nRaj: I\u2019m going to be 30 years old, and I have no one in my life to love me. I\u2019m such a basket case, I can\u2019t even talk to a woman without having alcohol in my body.\nSheldon: The fun thing about Prince Joey is every time he moves, there\u2019s a one-in-five chance he\u2019ll kill himself.\nRaj: Sheldon, listen to me. I have a big decision to make, and I\u2019m scared.\nSheldon: Yellow. Go ahead.\nRaj: A friend at the School of Pharmacology gave me these new pills they\u2019re testing. He says it\u2019s the next big thing for social anxiety disorder.\nSheldon: Fascinating. What\u2019s in it?\nRaj: I\u2019m not sure. Some sort of beta-blocker attached to a molecule extracted from the urine of cows.\nSheldon: I like cows.\nRaj: That\u2019s not the point.\nSheldon: It was its own point. Go on.\nRaj: I\u2019m a scientist. My ability to think is my bread and butter. I\u2019m afraid if I take this, I might lose that special, unique something that makes me so successful in my field.\nSheldon: Rajesh, I\u2019ve had the privilege of working alongside you for many years. My recommendation is that you gobble these up like Tic Tacs.\nScene: Raj\u2019s apartment. \nHoward: Okay, I\u2019m still trying to work this out. How did Penny meet an astronaut?\nBernadette: I don\u2019t know. The regular way people meet astronauts.\nHoward: Most of those guys live in Texas.\nBernadette: Obviously, this one doesn\u2019t.\nHoward: Okay.\nBernadette: Leonard lives here. Priya\u2019s from India. People meet, Howard. God!\nHoward: Fine.\nBernadette: You\u2019ve met lots of astronauts, and I\u2019ve never grilled you about that. I\u2019d thank you to extend me the same courtesy.\nHoward: I\u2019m not grilling you, I was just curious.\nLeonard: I still can\u2019t get over the fact that she got a big movie part. Not that I care what my ex-girlfriend\u2019s up to, \u2019cause I don\u2019t.\nBernadette: Maybe that\u2019s where she met the astronaut, all right?\nPriya: I\u2019m sorry. What would an astronaut be doing working on a movie?\nBernadette: He\u2019s a consultant.\nLeonard: I thought the movie was about 18th-century Vienna?\nBernadette: He can\u2019t have a hobby? Excuse me, I have to pee. Or is that implausible, as well?\nHoward: It\u2019s nice to have another couple to hang with, isn\u2019t it?\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment. \nPenny (to the shoes): All right, guys, you have to go back. I can\u2019t afford you. \u201cNo, don\u2019t send\nus away, we love you.\u201d I love you, too, but you cost more than my rent. \u201cBut, Penny, you look so good in us.\u201d Damn it, the shoes are right.\nAmy: Good golly, Penny, your whimsy is boundless. (Phone rings) What do you got for me, wildebeest?\nBernadette (in Raj\u2019s bathroom): I think they\u2019re on to me. The story\u2019s starting to fall apart.\nAmy: Calm down. Everything\u2019s going to be okay. (To Penny) We may have to kill her. Bernadette, I\u2019m putting you on speakerphone. Where are you now?\nBernadette: In the bathroom.\nAmy: Oh, look at this, another one of our classic bathroom gabfests. What\u2019s the problem?\nBernadette: They\u2019re just asking me all sorts of questions I can\u2019t answer.\nAmy: Just change the subject.\nBernadette: I suppose I could get them back to talking about Leonard going to India to meet Priya\u2019s parents.\nPenny: What?\nBernadette: They said something about going there this summer.\nPenny: What, are they getting engaged?\nBernadette: I don\u2019t know. I was too busy covering my heinie on Amy\u2019s stupid astronaut story!\nAmy: What astronaut story?\nBernadette: You texted me Penny\u2019s dating an astronaut.\nAmy: I texted architect. That\u2019s amusing. Auto-correct must\u2019ve changed it.\nBernadette: Yeah, it\u2019s hysterical.\nPenny: All right, look, just forget about the astronaut.\nAmy: Architect. Where would you have met an astronaut?\nPenny: Look, just find out what\u2019s up with this trip to India.\nBernadette: I don\u2019t want to do this anymore!\nPenny: Don\u2019t you quit on us!\nHoward (knocking on bathroom door): Bernie, you okay?\nBernadette (screaming): It was an architect!\nScene: A coffee shop.\nRaj: Thank you for coming with me, Sheldon. You\u2019re a good friend.\nSheldon: I\u2019m glad you think so. That\u2019s what I strive to emulate.\nRaj: Okay, let\u2019s see if this drug works.\nWoman at table: Can I help you?\nRaj: Forgive me for staring, but you\u2019re very beautiful.\nWoman: Thank you. That\u2019s a great accent. Where are you from?\nRaj: India.\nWoman: Oh, cool. I\u2019ve always wanted to go there.\nRaj: It\u2019s a beautiful country. You\u2019d love it. May I join you?\nWoman: Uh, okay, sure. Why not?\nRaj: My name is Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali, and this is my friend Dr. Sheldon Cooper.\nWoman: Hi.\nSheldon: Oh, there\u2019s no need to interact with me. I\u2019m just here to observe.\nWoman: What\u2019s he observing?\nRaj: We\u2019re scientists. We observe everything. Here, go buy yourself a scone.\nSheldon: All right.\nRaj: And what is your name?\nWoman: Angela.\nRaj: Oh, derived from the word angel. Appropriate.\nAngela: You\u2019re cute.\nSheldon: I\u2019d like to buy a scone.\nServer: Oh, I\u2019m sorry, we\u2019re out. We have muffins.\nSheldon: They sound delicious, but this money is earmarked for scones.\nAngela: What are you doing?\nRaj (taking his shirt off): Oh, just getting comfortable. So how long have you lived in Los Angeles?\nAngela: I\u2026\nSheldon: They were out of scones.\nRaj (removing his trousers): Sheldon, I\u2019m talking to someone. You\u2019re being rude. I\u2019ll bet you\u2019re an actress. If not, you should be. You have a very expressive face.\nAngela: Oh, my God.\nRaj: Wait, where are you going? We were doing so well. She never even got to see my penis. Ta-da!\nScene: Raj\u2019s apartment. They are playing Jenga, \nPriya: Who wants some more coffee?\nLeonard: Thanks, yeah.\nHoward: Sure.\nBernadette: Let me help you.\nHoward: Nice to see that the gals are getting along.\nLeonard: Gals? Who are you, Fred Flintstone?\nBernadette: This trip to India sounds fun.\nPriya: Yeah, I think it will be.\nBernadette: Are you concerned your parents might not approve of Leonard?\nPriya: A little. They\u2019re very old-fashioned.\nBernadette: Well, I wouldn\u2019t worry about it. It\u2019s not like you guys are getting engaged, right?\nPriya: Oh, God, no. We\u2019re not there yet.\nBernadette: Not engaged. Very interesting. I have to tinkle.\nPriya: You\u2019ve been in there a lot tonight. Are you okay?\nBernadette: Yes. Are you writing a book?\nPriya: Why are you getting upset?\nBernadette: I\u2019m not upset. Maybe you\u2019re upset.\nPriya: What\u2019s up with you? Bernadette?\nBernadette: I can\u2019t do this anymore! I\u2019m a good girl! I went to Catholic school! (Storms out,)\nHoward: Okay, well, it\u2019s getting late. This was terrific. You win. Bernie?\nLeonard: I think the word you\u2019re looking for is befuddled.\nScene: The apartment. Sheldon, Leonard and Howard are playing three person chess. \nSheldon: My catapult flings my bishop to Howard\u2019s Queen\u2019s Gorilla two.\nHoward: Nice. Okay, rook to transporter pad. And he comes out at Leonard\u2019s Queen\u2019s Bishop\nfive-and-a-third. Check on Leonard.\nLeonard: Hang on. When is my pawn allowed to use the golf cart?\nSheldon: When it\u2019s done charging. Or you land on the time machine. Obviously.\nLeonard: Oh, oh, Beekeeper to King 12. I capture your Pope and release the swarm. Checkmate on Sheldon.\nSheldon: I knew I should have given my Pope the jet pack.\nRaj (still naked): Hey, I\u2019ve got winners.\n\n\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "5_4": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: The entrance to the dungeon is a moss covered door. You manage to open it only to find yourself face-to-face with a hideous, foul-smelling, moss-covered ogre. What do you do?\nHoward: I say, hey Ma, what\u2019s for dinner?\u201d\nSheldon: Seventeen. The ogre is amused by your joke and allows you to pass. By the by, I liked it, too.\nLeonard: Hey, how go the wedding plans, Howard?\nHoward: Great. We spent five hours last night at Macy\u2019s registering for gifts. Looks like I\u2019m finally going to have that darling little earthenware asparagus dish I\u2019ve always wanted.\nLeonard: See, this is the good thing about having a girlfriend 9,000 miles away. I can spend my nights doing whatever I want.\nHoward: You mean like playing nerd games with us and then taking a suspiciously long shower?\nLeonard: Maybe. We enter the dungeon.\nSheldon: You see a dragon.\nHoward: Really? So we\u2019re playing Dungeons and Dragons, and we walk into a dungeon and see a dragon? Isn\u2019t that a little on the nose?\nSheldon: When you play Chutes and Ladders, do you complain about all the chutes and all the ladders?\nLeonard: Are you gonna eat that whole pie?\nRaj: Maybe. Why not? Who do I have in my life to watch my figure for?\nLeonard: Oh, God, did you watch Bridget Jones again?\nRaj: No, it\u2019s just that everybody\u2019s got someone. Sheldon\u2019s with Amy, Howard\u2019s getting married, you\u2019re dating my sister.\nLeonard: Now that Howard\u2019s getting married, maybe he\u2019ll inflate one of his old girlfriends for you.\nRaj: You know who I blame for my loneliness? The United States of America. Your movies and your TV shows promised streets paved with beautiful blonde women with big bazongas.\nHoward: Eat another pie, you\u2019ll have your own bazongas.\nRaj: That\u2019s cruel. You know it goes straight to my hips.\nSheldon: Gentlemen, please focus. You\u2019re facing a fire-breathing dragon.\nRaj: I don\u2019t know if I want to play anymore.\nSheldon: Because you don\u2019t have a girlfriend? Well, good Lord, if that becomes a reason not to play Dungeons and Dragons, this game\u2019s in serious trouble.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment.\nAmy: Now, I assume we use this same wax later on to neaten up each other\u2019s bikini regions.\nPenny: Yeah, my bikini region is fine.\nAmy: Who\u2019s shocked? I\u2019m not. So, Bernadette, how\u2019s the wedding planning going? And I\u2019m not asking as a prospective bridesmaid. Pick me! Pick me!\nBernadette: We went cake-tasting yesterday. Raj came along. He cried and ate half the samples.\nPenny: Oh, the poor guy\u2019s so lonely. We should set him up with someone.\nBernadette: You know, I met a really cute girl at work. She\u2019s married to a guy in one of our drug trials.\nPenny: Well, hello? She\u2019s married.\nBernadette: Yeah, but her husband is in serious congestive heart failure, and a little birdie told me he\u2019s in the placebo group.\nPenny: Okay, so future grief-stricken widow is the one to beat.\nScene: The Cheesecake Factory.\nLeonard: Are we ready to order?\nSheldon: One moment. I\u2019m conducting an experiment.\nHoward: With Dungeons and Dragons dice?\nSheldon: Yes. From here on in, I\u2019ve decided to make all trivial decisions with a throw of the dice, thus freeing up my mind to do what it does best, enlighten and amaze. Page 14, item seven.\nHoward: So, what\u2019s for dinner?\nSheldon: A side of corn succotash. Hmm. Interesting.\nPenny: Um, Howard, can I see you for a minute, please?\nHoward: Uh, I don\u2019t want to show any more of your friends how I can fit in the booster seats.\nPenny: Uh, no, that\u2019s not it. Just come with me, please.\nSheldon: Let\u2019s see what I\u2019ll be washing that succotash down with. A pitcher of margaritas.\nLeonard: Do you really want that?\nSheldon: That\u2019s the great thing. It doesn\u2019t matter. My mind is freed up to think about more important things.\nRaj: What\u2019s it thinking about now?\nSheldon: Hamburgers and lemonade.\nPenny: Um, Raj, there\u2019s someone I want you to meet. This is my friend Emily. I know her from my spin class. Raj, relax. She can\u2019t hear you. She\u2019s deaf.\nHoward (signing): Emily, this is our friend Raj.\nPenny: Oh! Look at you guys just hitting it off. I am so good.\nRaj: Hi.\nHoward: She says it\u2019s nice to meet you.\nRaj: Does she really mean that or was she signing it sarcastically?\nHoward: Raj says it\u2019s nice to meet you, too. She says she has to go back to her family, but Penny has her number if you want to text her and get together.\nRaj: Okay, I\u2019m going to play it cool. Tell her, maybe. Whatever, babe.\nHoward: He\u2019ll text you.\nRaj: Ah, look at that. I have a date. I love America again.\nSheldon: And now for dessert, come on, hot fudge sundae, come on, hot fudge sundae. Bam! That\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about!\nScene: A coffee shop.\nRaj: Okay, as soon as she gets here, so she knows I\u2019m cool with it, I\u2019m going to make a joke about her being deaf. I was thinking, hey, did you hear the one about\u2026? Oh, no, I bet you didn\u2019t.\nHoward: Maybe we should revisit your lonely fat guy plan.\nRaj: Oh, she\u2019s here.\nHoward: No joke. Oh, she says she\u2019s sorry she\u2019s late.\nRaj: Tell her it doesn\u2019t matter. Tell her, her eyes shimmer like opalescent lilies in the lake of the palace of the celestial maidens.\nHoward: Really? That\u2019s the first thing you want to say?\nRaj: I worked on it all night. Use it.\nHoward: Look, I don\u2019t know the sign for opalescent.\nRaj: Then spell it.\nHoward: I don\u2019t know how to spell it.\nRaj: You\u2019re blowing this for me!\nHoward: He likes your eyes.\nRaj: You\u2019re making me sound like a caveman.\nHoward: She says, thank you, you have nice eyes, too.\u201d\nRaj: Really? Ask her how many children she wants, and whatever number she says, say, me too.\nHoward: No.\nRaj: Fine. Tell her I have a deep, sexy voice like James Earl Jones.\nHoward: She doesn\u2019t know what James Earl Jones sounds like.\nRaj: Great. Then she won\u2019t know I\u2019m lying.\nScene: The same, later.\nRaj: Let\u2019s see, what else can I tell you about me that would make you like me? Ooh, I love music. Do you love music?\nHoward: You really want to ask her that?\nRaj: You\u2019re right. Everyone loves music.\nHoward: She says, do you play an instrument?\nRaj: No, but when I was six years old, I tried to start a boy band called Frankie Goes to Bollywood. But I couldn\u2019t get any other boys to join, so my parents asked the servants to be my backup dancers. Wait, when you sign servants, don\u2019t sign it like I\u2019m bragging. Sign it in a way that I sound humble with just a hint of, that\u2019s right, I had servants.\nHoward: Do you hear yourself\nRaj: Yes, but she doesn\u2019t. So get signing, hand monkey.\nScene: The same, later.\nHoward (translating for Emily): I think I wrote a letter to Santa Claus every day. And then on Christmas morning, under the tree is a little puppy with a red ribbon.\nRaj: What are you doing?\nHoward: Texting Bernadette that I\u2019m gonna be late.\nRaj: Dude, what is she saying?\nHoward: It\u2019s a funny story about a puppy. Just smile and laugh. Quick, quick, stop smiling.\nRaj: What? Why?\nHoward: The puppy died, it choked on a doll head. Sad face, sad face!\nScene: Outside the coffee shop.\nRaj: It\u2019s a little hard to see with the city lights, but that W-shaped constellation is Cassiopeia. And she was the mother of Andromeda who\u2019s over there.\nHoward: Look, pretty stars. This is her car. She hopes she can see you again sometime.\nRaj: Good, good. Oh, boy, help me out here. Does she want me to kiss her or not?\nHoward: I speak sign language, I don\u2019t read minds.\nRaj: If you were me, would you kiss her?\nHoward: Yeah, but I\u2019m a make out king. (She kisses Raj and gets into car)\nRaj: I was so smooth on that date.\nHoward: You? I made you smooth. You were an idiot.\nRaj: Whatever, dude. She kissed me.\nHoward: It might\u2019ve been on your lips, but it was my kiss.\nRaj: Oh, fine. Let\u2019s agree she kissed both of us.\nHoward: Okay.\nScene: The apartment. \nPenny: Mustache is looking good there, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Don\u2019t thank me. Thank the dice. They told me what percentage of my face to shave.\nHoward: Why are you still doing this?\nSheldon: Because it\u2019s working. In the past few weeks, unburdened by trivial decisions, I\u2019ve co-authored two papers in notable peer-reviewed journals, and I\u2019m close to figuring out why the Large Hadron Collider has yet to isolate the Higgs boson particle.\nLeonard: You left out, got chafed testicles because you no longer wear underpants.\nSheldon: The dice giveth and the dice taketh away.\nPenny: Is Raj out with Emily again?\nLeonard: Yeah, every night for the last month.\nPenny: Wow, can\u2019t believe he has a girlfriend.\nSheldon (rolls dice): Me neither.\nHoward: Here\u2019s some other fun news on the Raj/Emily front. He gave her a pair of diamond earrings and leased her a car.\nPenny: You\u2019re kidding.\nLeonard: You think she\u2019s taking advantage of him?\nPenny: Oh, of course not. She wouldn\u2019t do something like that. She\u2019s deaf.\nLeonard: Deaf women can\u2019t be gold diggers?\nPenny: Handicapped people are nice, Leonard. Everyone knows that.\nSheldon: Yeah, I actually have information about Raj that would be helpful with this discussion.\nLeonard: Could you tell us?\nSheldon: Let\u2019s see. (Rolls dice) Snake eyes. Sorry, bud.\nPenny: Wait, hang on. Doubles. Roll again.\nSheldon: Okay, get this. It doesn\u2019t matter if he\u2019s showering her with gifts, because the Koothrappalis are vastly wealthy.\nPenny: What do you mean, vastly wealthy?\nSheldon: Well, wealthy means a lot of money, and vastly means even more. I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s tripping you up.\nLeonard: Look, I know they have money. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that much.\nSheldon: No, you\u2019re wrong. See, as you know, a few years ago, I achieved one of my lesser dreams and became a notary public. Well, from time to time, I notarize banking documents for Raj. The Koothrappalis aren\u2019t just rich, they\u2019re Richie Rich rich.\nPenny: Well, so how much is that?\nSheldon: About halfway between Bruce Wayne and Scrooge McDuck.\nHoward: What the hell? The last time we went to the zoo, that son of a bitch made me buy him a churro.\nLeonard: Listen, guys, I\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t mean to be rude, but I need to go call Raj\u2019s sister, who I love so much. So vastly much.\nPenny: Okay, so he\u2019s got money, and it\u2019s a few gifts and a car.\nHoward: And she got him to pay off all her credit cards.\nPenny: What? He paid off her credit cards? Damn it, I could\u2019ve dated Raj for a couple months. But I, I wouldn\u2019t have, because I\u2019m not that kind of girl. We should really talk to Raj.\nHoward: He\u2019s not going to listen, he\u2019s in love.\nSheldon: Can\u2019t figure out what to do? I remember those days. Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I have to\u2026 (rolls dice) stay right here.\nScene: The gym.\nHoward: Yeah, this is a bad idea. We should go.\nPenny: No. I\u2019m the one that introduced him to her. I\u2019ve got to say something.\nHoward: Wow.\nPenny: You\u2019re engaged to my friend.\nHoward: Hey, Bernadette doesn\u2019t mind where I get my motor running, as long as I park in the right garage.\nPenny: I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re engaged to my friend. Oh, here she comes.\nHoward: Smart. Whisper so the deaf chick can\u2019t hear you.\nPenny: Hi.\nHoward (translating): Oh, hey, hi. Nice to see you.\nPenny: Um, can we talk to you about Raj?\nHoward: She says, sure, what about him?\nPenny: Okay, um, gosh, how do I start? Um, see, Raj is kind of naive. I mean, he hasn\u2019t dated a whole lot of women. And I\u2019m concerned that, without meaning to, you might be taking advantage of him. You know, by letting him buy you a bunch of expensive things.And I.. I\u2026 Howard, focus. Tell her what I\u2019m saying.\nHoward: Right. Are you a gold digger or not? Oh, uh, something, something, who the something do you think you are? Mind your own something business and go something yourself. Oh, wait, I got this now.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment. She answers the door.\nRaj: I\u2019m so mad at you!\nPenny: Okay, wait\u2026\nRaj: How dare you ambush my girlfriend at the gym!\nPenny: We didn\u2019t mean for it to be an ambush. Just, it\u2019s kind of impossible not to sneak up on deaf people. And hey, since when are you so chatty?\nRaj: I\u2019m hammered.\nPenny: Raj, come here. This girl is trouble. I mean, what kind of relationship is it where you buy her gifts and she gives you sex?\nRaj: The best one I ever had!\nPenny: Okay, come on. You know you can do better.\nRaj: Aha. I see what\u2019s going on here. You and I had our crazy night together, and now you can\u2019t stand to see me with another woman.\nPenny: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!\nRaj: It\u2019s okay. I can\u2019t get mad at your feelings.\nPenny: I don\u2019t have feelings.\nRaj: Yeah, that\u2019s good. Keep telling yourself that. (Storms out)\nPenny: He is cuter now that I know he\u2019s rich.\nScene: Raj\u2019s apartment.\nRaj: I have a surprise for you. Cover your eyes. Open them. It\u2019s a real ruby. It was a little expensive, but no one can put a price on love. Although, the people at Cartier took a pretty good shot at it. (Skype tone from computer) Oh, Mummy, Daddy. What a nice surprise.\nDr Koothrappali: No, it\u2019s not a nice surprise, it\u2019s a bad surprise.\nMrs Koothrappali: Penny called us.\nRaj: Penny?\nMrs Koothrappali: She told us you\u2019re spending all our money on your new girlfriend.\nRaj: I just got her a couple of things. She gives me things, too.\nDr Koothrappali: Yeah, yeah, I\u2019m a gynaecologist. I know exactly what she gives you.\nMrs Koothrappali: You need to find a nice Indian girl from a good family. If you keep seeing this woman, you\u2019re cut off.\nRaj: What? You\u2019re going to make me choose between the woman I love and the money I have very strong feelings for?\nDr Koothrappali: It\u2019s up to you.\nRaj: Well, I choose love.\nDr Koothrappali: Hah. You\u2019re an idiot. Love doesn\u2019t last. Well, he\u2019s going to find out eventually. Think about it.\nRaj: My parents are making me choose between money and you. I choose you. (She signs) No, I think we\u2019ll have to return the car. (Again) And that necklace, yeah, that, too. But none of those things matter, because we have something better. We have love.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment.\nRaj: Oh, Penny, I hurt so bad.\nPenny: I know, I know.\nRaj: Sometimes I put the TV on mute just to pretend she\u2019s still with me. But I can\u2019t watch the closed captioning without crying.\nPenny: Oh, I\u2019m so sorry. I wish I could make you feel better.\nRaj: Seriously? I\u2019m heartbroken and you\u2019re hitting on me?\nPenny: What? No!\nRaj: Look, Penny, you\u2019re great, but I had a long talk with my parents, and they said if I date an Indian girl, I get a Maserati.\nScene: The Cheesecake Factory.\nRaj: Mmm. Oh, cheesecake, you\u2019re just as good as a woman, even though I can\u2019t have sex with you.\nHoward: Try throwing it in the microwave for a few seconds.\nSheldon: Should I use the rest room or wait until we get home? Come on, papa needs to void his bladder. Oh, that\u2019s not what you want to see after three buttermilks.\nPenny: Here you go, boys. I\u2019ll pick it up when you\u2019re ready.\nHoward: Thanks for dinner, buddy.\nLeonard: Yeah, real big of you.\nSheldon: Hurry, hurry, hurry.\nPenny: Oh, and don\u2019t cheap out on the tip.

Zeusowitz.\nSheldon: I must admit, I can\u2019t help but feel a twinge of envy. He can look out the window and see the majesty of the universe unfolding before his eyes. His dim, uncomprehending eyes. It\u2019s like a cat in an airport carrying case.\nLeonard: You know, it\u2019s not exactly glamorous up there.

Soon, my upper lip will be the same fake blonde as my beautiful best friend.\nPenny: Hey, this is my natural hair colour. Now. So, does Sheldon have anything special planned for you tomorrow night?\nAmy: Oh, yes. According to the Relationship Agreement, on the anniversary of our first date, he must take me to a nice dinner, ask about my day and engage in casual physical contact that a disinterested onlooker might mistake for intimacy.\nPenny: That\u2019s hot. You kids better use protection.\nAmy: How long does this stay on?\nPenny: Just a couple of minutes. You\u2019ve really never done this before?\nAmy: Once in high school, but I dozed off and woke up with second-degree chemical burns on my face.\nPenny: Oh, my gosh, that\u2019s awful. The other kids make fun of you?\nAmy: No, I had a cover story, I told everyone it was herpes. So, how\u2019s everything going with you and Leonard?\nPenny: Uh, I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s still kind of weird. We haven\u2019t really recovered since he proposed to me in the middle of sex.\nAmy: Oh, boo-hoo. If Sheldon proposed to me during sex, my ovaries would grab on to him and never let go.\nScene: The university cafeteria.\nSheldon: Leonard, where do you stand on the anthropic principle?\nLeonard: Interesting question. On the one hand, I always thought\u2026\nSheldon: You don\u2019t even know what it is, do you? The anthropic principle states that if we wish to explain why our universe exists the way it does, the answer is that it must have qualities that allow intelligent creatures to arise who are capable of asking the question. As I am doing so eloquently right now.\nLeonard: I know what the anthropic principle is.\nSheldon: Of course. I just explained it to you. Now, where do you stand on it?\nLeonard: Where do you stand on it? \nSheldon: Strongly pro.\nLeonard: Then I believe that God created the world in six days, and on the seventh he made you to annoy me.\nRaj: Hey, guys.\nLeonard: Hey.\nSheldon: Yeah, wait, Raj, where do you stand on the anthropic principle?\nRaj: I\u2019m all for it.\nSheldon: Attaboy!\nLeonard: Well, hang on.

I don\u2019t need to tell you in Los Angeles, sandal season is year round.\nLeonard: Actually, I\u2019m hanging out with Penny. \nRaj: Oh, okay. Sounds like it\u2019s me and you, Sheldon. How about we sic some guppies on those puppies?\nSheldon: As I\u2019ve stated before on numerous occasions, the only sea creature I would even consider being eaten by is the Kraken, because the last words I would hear are \u201cRelease the Kraken.\u201d That never gets old. \u201cRelease the Kraken!\u201d Oh, chills. Besides, I\u2019m having dinner with Amy.\nRaj: Oh, okay. I\u2019ll just go home and be alone. Which is cool. I eat alone, I sleep alone, I cry alone, so, cool.\nSheldon: Darn. If you weren\u2019t busy, I\u2019d ask you to join us.\nRaj: Really? I can come? Thanks.\nLeonard: Sheldon, are you sure you want to be bringing Raj on your date night with Amy?\nSheldon: Oh, absolutely.

How crazy is that?\nBernadette: You said you told her, but you never did!\nHoward: Okay, okay, I know you\u2019re upset, but let me share something I\u2019ve learned since I got here. You realize how small your problems are when you\u2019re looking down on them from space. Now, come on, that\u2019s got to make you feel better.\nBernadette: How clear is the image of me on that screen?\nHoward: Pretty clear.\nBernadette: Do I look like I feel better?\nHoward: I mean, it\u2019s not, like, HD quality.\nBernadette: Listen, mister, you\u2019re gonna talk to your mother and you\u2019re gonna fix this, or that thing I said I was gonna do to you the minute you got home, you can do to yourself.\nDimitri: Like he\u2019s been doing since he got here.\nScene: A restaurant.\nAmy: Sheldon, this place is so romantic. \nSheldon: Oh, I\u2019m glad you like it.

What\u2019s he doing here?\nSheldon: I invited him.\nAmy: On our date? Sheldon, that\u2019s not okay.\nSheldon: Yes, it is. There\u2019s a loophole in the Relationship Agreement.\nAmy: You found a loophole?\nRaj: Sorry I started without you. I\u2019m a little nervous.

She\u2019ll knock out those sideburns for free.\nLater.\nRaj: You know, Amy, I don\u2019t even think you and I have had a real conversation. Let\u2019s use tonight to get to know each other a little better. You start.\nAmy: Go home.\nRaj: I don\u2019t understand.\nAmy: Sheldon, how could you do this? It\u2019s our second anniversary.\nRaj: It\u2019s your anniversary? Oh, my God, I had no idea. Amy, please, let me make this right. \nAmy: Thank you.\nRaj: My pleasure. Waiter? A bottle of champagne and three glasses. Oh, boy, isn\u2019t this romantic?\nSheldon: Oh, I hope that\u2019s a rhetorical question, because I have no clue.\nScene: The apartment. \nPenny: This is great. What\u2019s the occasion?\nLeonard: No occasion. You know, things have been a little weird between us, so I wanted to throw together a fun night just for you.\nPenny: That is so sweet.\nLeonard: I got all your favourites. Beer, wings, sliders. We can watch the football game. I even painted my stomach.\nPenny: Go Sports?\nLeonard: Well, in case you were in the mood for baseball, I didn\u2019t want to look ridiculous.\nPenny: This is awesome. I love it!\nLeonard: Good, I\u2019m glad. \nPenny: Gosh, I worked my ass off today. This is exactly what I needed.\nLeonard: Great. Just relax and enjoy. Tonight is all about you.\nPenny: Ah, thank you!\nLeonard: So, where exactly are we in this relationship?\nPenny: Oh, come on. I just told you I had a hard day.\nLeonard: You\u2019re right, I\u2019m sorry. Let\u2019s watch the game. \nPenny: Great.\nLeonard: I just know the longer we wait to talk about it, the weirder it gets.\nPenny: Sweetie, can I just be the girl tonight?\nLeonard: Absolutely. You\u2019re the girl, I\u2019m the guy. Now, you watch your football game while I make you a little plate here.\nPenny: Thank you. (Knock on door)\nLeonard: Oh, I\u2019ll get it. Go sports.\nRaj: Hello-lo-lo.\nLeonard: What are you doing here? I thought you were out with Sheldon and Amy.\nRaj: I was, but it\u2019s their anniversary and I didn\u2019t want to be a third wheel, so I figured I\u2019d come over here and hang out with you and Penny on your date.\nLeonard: Well, it\u2019s not really a great time. Penny and I have some things we need to talk about.\nPenny: No, we don\u2019t! Come on in!\nRaj: Sweet!\nLeonard: I can\u2019t believe I shaved my stomach for this.\nScene: The International Space Station\nDimitri: Hey, Froot Loops. You got a phone call.\nHoward: Who is it?\nDimitri: A woman who says she\u2019s your mother but sounds like your father.\nHoward: Hey, Ma. You know, we could see each other if you turn on the computer.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): I\u2019m not going near that fakakta thing. I\u2019ll catch a computer virus.\nHoward: You can\u2019t catch a computer virus.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Oh, so now you\u2019re an astronaut and a doctor?\nHoward: What do you want, Ma?\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Your wife says you have something important to tell me.\nHoward: Okay, here it is. Bernadette and I are starting a life together and\u2026\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Oh, God! You are gonna leave me.\nHoward: Ma\u2026\nMrs Wolowitz (off): It\u2019s okay. Your father left me, you left me, I guess I\u2019m just the kind of person people like to leave.\nHoward: It\u2019s not definite. I\u2019ll talk to Bernadette.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Don\u2019t bother. I\u2019ll just go sit in a hole in the ground so I\u2019m no trouble when I die.\nHoward: Stop it, Ma. I\u2019m sure I can get Bernie to come around.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): I knew it. I knew she was behind this. You listen to me, if you want to be a man you can\u2019t let a woman tell you what to do.\nHoward: Okay, okay.\nDimitri: Oy. I can\u2019t believe these people won the Cold War.\nHoward: Now, can we please change the subject?\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Fine. Explain why you\u2019ve been gone so long and I haven\u2019t gotten a single letter. Not even a lousy postcard.\nScene: The apartment.\nRaj: You know, I\u2019m growing to like American football. \nPenny: Yeah, it\u2019s fun, isn\u2019t it?\nRaj: Well, it\u2019s not the balls-to-the-wall action of badminton or cricket, but hey, what is?\nPenny: All right, who\u2019s ready for another beer?\nLeonard: I\u2019m good.\nRaj: No, thank you.\nPenny: Girls.\nRaj: Oh, I\u2019m having the nicest time. You guys are like family to me. You know that, right?\nLeonard: That\u2019s great. Get out.\nRaj: What? Why?\nLeonard: Penny and I have some issues we need to talk about.\nRaj: Oh pish on your issues. You guys are fine. Yes, you hit some bumps along the way. I mean, Penny, you\u2019ve always known how this man has felt about you, but you made him grovel for affection.\nPenny: Okay, hold on\u2026\nRaj: Now, don\u2019t blame yourself. He was a groveller from way back. But the point is, the two of you got past it. And, Leonard, you go and propose to this poor girl in the middle of sex? That was some weak tea, dude.\nLeonard: Some people might say it was romantic.\nRaj: Yeah, no. But yet, here you two are, still together. And that\u2019s even after you and I had our crazy naked night.\nLeonard: Okay.\nPenny: That\u2019s enough.\nRaj: I\u2019m just saying that after everything you\u2019ve been through, you get to look into each other\u2019s eyes and say \u201cI love you.\u201d And that\u2019s beautiful.\nLeonard: Actually, to this day, she\u2019s never really said it.\nRaj: Oh, Penny. That\u2019s ridiculous. You know you love him. You, you look him in the eyes and you say it. \nPenny: Raj.\nRaj: Oh come on, you know you want to say it. Say it. Say you love him. Say it!\nScene: The hallway. Raj is ejected from the apartment.\nRaj: I really thought she would say it.\nScene: The restaurant.\nAmy: Have I ever told you you\u2019re like a sexy praying mantis? \nSheldon: Every time you drink alcohol.\nAmy: You know what\u2019s wonderful about the praying mantis? They devour their mate.\nSheldon: Your point being?\nAmy: Dessert is served.\nSheldon: I just had cobbler.\nAmy: You know what? I\u2019m done with this.\nSheldon: W-Where are you going?\nAmy: I\u2019m leaving.\nSheldon: You can\u2019t leave. I need you.\nAmy: You do?\nSheldon: Yes. You\u2019re my ride.\nAmy: Sheldon, you either say something meaningful and from the heart, or you and I are done.\nSheldon: All right. Please. Amy, when I look in your eyes and you\u2019re looking back in mine, everything feels not quite normal, because I feel stronger and weaker at the same time. I feel excited and, at the same time, terrified. The truth is, I don\u2019t know what I feel, except I know what kind of man I want to be.\nAmy: Sheldon, that was beautiful.\nSheldon: I should hope so. That\u2019s from the first Spider-Man movie.\nAmy: I\u2019ll take it.\nSheldon: Good. Now, I assume we\u2019re splitting the cheque?\nScene: The Comic Book Store.\nRaj: Hey, Stuart.\nStuart: Oh, hey. I was actually just about to close up.\nRaj: Oh, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ll leave.\nStuart: No, no. It\u2019s okay. Hang out. \nRaj: You sure?\nStuart: Yeah, you\u2019re my first customer today.\nRaj: All right. Great.\nStuart: I\u2019m, uh, having a nightcap. You want to join me?\nRaj: What are you drinking?\nStuart: Coffee liqueur in a Chewbacca mug. I call it a sad-tini.\nRaj: Perfect for the night I\u2019m having. Thank you.\nStuart: Hmm. Nice not to drink alone.\nRaj: Amen to that. Sometimes I pour a little chardonnay into my dog\u2019s water bowl.\nStuart: You\u2019re kidding.\nRaj: She\u2019s kind of a mean drunk, but what are you gonna do?\nStuart: Cheers.\nRaj: Cheers.\nStuart: A little music?\nRaj: Sure. Mmm. Bossa nova. You listen to that with your hips as well as your ears.\nStuart: Mmm.\nRaj: Oh. Something about latin music just makes me feel like I\u2019m on a white sand beach in Rio.\nStuart: Yeah. The sun, the waves, the beautiful bodies, tanned and glistening with sweat.\nRaj: I should go.\nStuart: Yeah.\nRaj: Uh, thank you for the drink.\nStuart: No problem.\nRaj: Hey, Stuart.\nStuart: Yeah?\nRaj: Do you want to hang out tomorrow night, maybe grab a bite to eat or catch a late movie?\nStuart: Yeah, I-I\u2019d like to, but I\u2019m a little tight on funds.\nRaj: No problem. My treat. I\u2019ll swing by after work.\nStuart: Okay.\nRaj: Okay.\nStuart: I could do worse.\nScene: The International Space Station\nBernadette: Aw, that\u2019s such good news, Howie. Thank you for telling her.\nHoward: Hey, I\u2019m a grown man. I\u2019m gonna live with my wife. My mother\u2019s just gonna have to learn to make do on her own.\nBernadette: Was she upset?\nHoward: Who can tell? She yells everything. She might have been upset. She might have been hungry.\nBernadette: Thanks for fixing it. I love you.\nHoward: I love you, too. Sweet dreams. I\u2019ll talk to you tomorrow?\nBernadette: Good night, Rocket Man.\nHoward: To infinity and beyond, baby.\nDimitri: Loops. You realize you just lied your ass off to your wife and your mother.\nHoward: I know.\nDimitri: What are you gonna do when you get back to Earth?\nHoward: Oh, I\u2019m never going back.\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "4_21": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The bathroom\nSheldon: Leonard, are you in the shower?\nLeonard: I can\u2019t hear you, I\u2019m in the shower.\nSheldon: I asked if you were in the shower, but that\u2019s moot now.\nLeonard: What?\nSheldon: Moot. Rendered unimportant by recent events.\nLeonard: I can\u2019t hear you, I\u2019m in the shower.\nSheldon: I have to skip the chitchat. Emergency.\nLeonard: What kind of emergency?\nSheldon: Mathematical. 32-ounce banana smoothie, 16-ounce bladder.\nLeonard: You might not want to do that.\nSheldon: I assure you I do.\nLeonard: Sheldon, I\u2019m not alone in here.\nSheldon: What?\nPriya: Hello, Sheldon.\nSheldon: What are you doing in there? She can\u2019t be in here.\nLeonard: We were in here first, you can\u2019t be in here.\nSheldon: According to the roommate agreement, paragraph nine, subsection B, the right to bathroom privacy is suspended in the event of force majeure. And believe me, I am experiencing a very majeure force.\nSheldon: Come on, you can\u2019t wait two minutes?\nPriya: Oh, Leonard, let the man pee.\nScene: Penny\u2019s door. \n\u00a0\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Penny? (Knock, knock, knock) Penny? (Knock, knock, knock) Penny?\nPenny: What?\nSheldon: Move. Move. Move!\nCredits sequence. \n\u00a0\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Dr. Leonard Hofstadter, you are officially charged with two violations of the roommate agreement. Do you waive reading of the charges?\nLeonard: Yeah, fine.\nPriya: Hang on. No, my client does not waive reading of the charges.\nLeonard: Oh. Cool. I\u2019ve got a lawyer. And I\u2019ve seen her naked.\nPriya: Proceed.\nSheldon: Very well. Count the first, on or about the 28th day of April, the accused did knowingly and with malice aforethought deny access to the shared bathroom in a time of emergency, to wit, my back teeth were floating. Count the second, the accused exceeded the agreed upon occupancy of the shower, to wit, one, unless we are under attack by water-soluble aliens.\nPriya: Can I see the roommate agreement?\nSheldon: Um, it\u2019s fairly technical.\nPriya: I think I can handle it.\nLeonard: Top of her class, Cambridge University. Licensed to practice law in three countries. And your face.\nPriya: All right, based on a cursory reading, it doesn\u2019t look like you have much of a case, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Do so, do so.\nPriya: Oh, I\u2019m afraid not. Section seven here, on the right to enter the bathroom in emergency situations, is not specific as to what constitutes an emergency.\nSheldon: Oh, that\u2019s ridiculous. A bathroom emergency is self-explanatory.\nPriya: Is it? If Leonard forgot to trim his nose hair, could he barge in while you were showering?\nSheldon: Irrelevant. Leonard doesn\u2019t trim his nose hair. He thinks because he\u2019s short nobody can see up there.\nPriya: My point is, Sheldon, the legal principle is ambiguity in a contract benefits the party that did not draft it, in this case, Leonard. So much for count one.\nSheldon: But\u2026\nPriya: There\u2019s no buts, Sheldon, that\u2019s how the law works.\nLeonard: Schooled!\nPriya: As for the shower capacity issue, I cite addendum J. When Sheldon showers second, any and all measures shall be taken to ensure an adequate supply of hot water. I believe this supercedes the occupancy issue.\nLeonard: Superceded!\nSheldon: This isn\u2019t over.\nLeonard: No offence, but shower sex with you is now the second best thing that\u2019s happened today.\nScene: The apartment. \nRaj: Mmm, Greek food on pizza night? This is the most delightfully cruel thing we\u2019ve done to Sheldon since we left that fake message from Stephen Hawking on his voice mail.\nPriya: Seriously?\nHoward (in Stephen Hawking voice): I wish to discuss your theories of black holes. Meet me at the Randy\u2019s Donut by the airport at 2:00 a.m.\nSheldon: What is that you\u2019re eating? Tonight is pizza night.\nLeonard: I\u2019d like to refer that to my attorney.\nPriya: According to what I see here, Thursday nights are Franconi\u2019s pizza night.\nSheldon: Yes, and when Franconi\u2019s went out of business, we switched to Graziano\u2019s.\nHoward: That\u2019s interesting. Can you just switch restaurants like that, Priya?\nPriya: A good question, Howard. Turns out you can\u2019t. According to the document you drew up, Sheldon, the selection of a new takeout restaurant requires public hearings and a 60-day comment period. Were those criteria met?\nSheldon: No.\nAll: Opa!\nSheldon: This is Greek food? Leonard, you hate Greek food.\nLeonard: Not as much as you.\nSheldon: Fine. I\u2019m nothing if not adaptable.\nLeonard: I got you the lamb kabob.\nSheldon: Thank you. If you think about it, Greek food isn\u2019t that far from italian food. They share a spice palette. And what a civilization is the Greeks. They gave us science, democracy, and little cubes of charred meat that taste like sweat.\nScene: Penny\u2019s door. \nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Penny? (Knock, knock, knock) Penny? (Knock, knock, knock) Penny?\nPenny: Hey. What\u2019s up?\nSheldon: The mean Indian lady tried to make me eat lamb. Congratulations. Pizza night will now be at your apartment. Order one.\nPenny: Oh, I\u2019m sorry, honey, I\u2019m meeting Amy and Bernadette for dinner. But you\u2019re welcome to tag along.\nSheldon: A girls night? Oh, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m up for an evening talking about rainbows, unicorns and menstrual cramps.\nPenny: Okay, suit yourself. We\u2019ll probably be trashing Priya a little.\nSheldon: Shotgun.\nScene: A bar.\nPenny: Okay, I\u2019d like to propose a toast to a wonderful girls night out.\nAmy: Fair warning, we can get ker-razy.\nBernadette: Yeah. Last week we smoked cigars and pretended to be dragons.\nSheldon: Really, Amy? Tobacco and alcohol? Need I remind you not a lot of scientific discoveries were made by people having a good time?\nAmy: Why did you bring him? He\u2019s harshing my buzz.\nPenny: I felt sorry for him. Priya\u2019s giving him a hard time.\nBernadette: Ooh, the Priya bashing\u2019s starting early. Yay! Okay, what\u2019s up with those pantsuits?\nAmy: I need some context.\nPenny: Pantsuits suck.\nAmy: And that opens her up To justifiable ridicule for wearing them. Good one, Bernadette. See? Ker-razy.\nScene: The same, later.\nBernadette: Whee-ee-ee!\nAmy: You smell like baby powder.\nSheldon: It\u2019s talc. But as that\u2019s a primary ingredient of baby powder, I understand your confusion.\nAmy: Oh, I\u2019m not confused at all. You\u2019re like a sexy toddler.\nSheldon: I don\u2019t know how to process that.\nBernadette: I do. Amy and Sheldon sitting in a tree. K-I-S-S-S-S-I-N-G.\nPenny: That\u2019s too many S\u2019s for kissing.\nBernadette: Not if they\u2019re doing it for a long time.\nPenny: Sheldon, have you ever kissed a girl?\nSheldon: Other than my mother, my sister and my mee-maw, no. But in the interest of full disclosure, I was once on a bus and had to give mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to an elderly nun who passed out from heat exhaustion. Every year I get a Christmas card from her, signed with far too many X\u2019s and O\u2019s.\nBernadette: That doesn\u2019t count. Aren\u2019t you even a little curious?\nPenny: Yeah, you\u2019re a scientist, where is the curiosity?\nAmy: I\u2019m available for experimentation.\nSheldon: Thank you. Not necessary. We know everything there is to know about kissing. It requires 34 facial muscles and 112 postural muscles.\nAmy: Oh, blah, blah, blah. Give me some sugar, bestie (kisses Penny).\nSheldon: I\u2019m certainly glad no one said they were curious about Aztec human sacrifice.\nPenny: Hey, I know, let\u2019s take Sheldon dancing.\nBernadette: Oh, I totally want to see Sheldon dance. I bet he looks like a spider on a hot plate.\nSheldon: No, thank you, but for the record, I\u2019m an excellent dancer. Proficient in the rumba, waltz and cha-cha.\nAmy: Really?\nSheldon: I don\u2019t see why that\u2019s surprising. I excel at so many things. You\u2019ve had my sourdough bread.\nPenny: Did you take dance lessons?\nSheldon: Against my will. In the South, pre-adolescent children are forced through a process called cotillion, which indoctrinates them with all the social graces and dance skills needed to function in 18th century Vienna.\nPenny: Oh, we are so taking you dancing.\nSheldon: No, you most certainly are not.\nBernadette: Well, what does your cotillion training say is expected of a gentleman when three ladies ask him to escort them to a dance soiree?\nSheldon: I saved a nun\u2019s life. Why am I being punished?\nScene: A taxi.\n\u00a0\nPenny: Take us to a place we can waltz.\nTaxi driver: Where you can what?\nSheldon: Waltz. It\u2019s a social dance from Austria, choreographed to a three-four time signature. (Sings Blue Danube. The taxi driver says something into radio in Korean. The word \u201cwaltz\u201d is included. Dispatcher replies also in Korean. Taxi driver sings Blue Danube. Dispatcher says \u201coh, waltz!\u201d They speak Korean some more. )\nTaxi Driver: Here we go.\nAmy (singing): I kissed a girl and I liked it, I hope my boyfriend don\u2019t mind it.\nSheldon: What happened to you?\nScene: A Korean ballroom dancing club. Sheldon and Amy are dancing. \nPenny: Shake it baby, shake it!\nBernadette: Muy caliente, Sheldon!\nElderly Korean Gentleman: Care to dance?\nBernadette: Oh, I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m engaged.\nKorean: How about you?\nPenny: Oh, what the hell. Ooh!\nScene: Outside Amy\u2019s apartment. \nAmy: How come if we\u2019re the smart people, we don\u2019t do this every night?\nSheldon: What\u2019s 16 times 14?\nAmy: My burps taste like cranberry juice.\nSheldon: And there\u2019s your answer.\nAmy: Would you like to come in for a nightcap?\nSheldon: If you\u2019re referring to the beverage, you know I don\u2019t drink. If you\u2019re referring to the hat you don while wearing a nightshirt and holding a candle, I have one.\nAmy: I have yoo-hoo.\nSheldon: It\u2019s hard to say no to yoo-hoo. The name literally beckons.\nAmy: Make yourself comfortable.\nSheldon: Thank you. Is someone smoking?\nAmy: Oh, that\u2019s just Ricky.\nSheldon: You own a smoking monkey?\nAmy: Don\u2019t be silly. He\u2019s one of the animals in my department\u2019s nicotine addiction study.\nSheldon: What\u2019s he doing here?\nAmy: I\u2019m giving him emphysema. The least I can do is let him hang out and watch cable.\nSheldon: Remarkable. Aren\u2019t you worried about secondhand smoke?\nAmy: A little. The real danger is him biting my face off while I\u2019m sleeping.\nSheldon: is he deliberately blowing smoke at me?\nAmy: Yeah. He\u2019s kind of an ass.\nSheldon: Thank you. May I share something with you that\u2019s troubling me?\nAmy: Of course. What\u2019s rattling around that big bulbous brain of yours?\nSheldon: Priya has essentially nullified my roommate agreement with Leonard, making life in the apartment very uncomfortable for me.\nAmy: And you want me to kill her? Done.\nSheldon: No, of course not.\nAmy: I trained Ricky how to smoke. I can train him to shoot a poison dart. No jury would convict us \u2019cause people love monkeys.\nSheldon: I understand the alcohol has stirred up whatever it is that makes girls go wild, but I really need to talk to smart Amy now.\nAmy: Excuse me. Have you considered that your intelligence might be the very thing causing your dilemma?\nSheldon: No.\nAmy: What do you think Ricky over here would do if an interloper encroached on his territory?\nSheldon: Well, when challenged, monkeys generally assert their dominance through chasing, assault and a stylized penile display. That\u2019s a little outside my comfort zone.\nAmy: You\u2019re being too literal. My point is, he would not meekly surrender to the rules, and neither should you.\nSheldon: Are you suggesting I play dirty?\nAmy: Yes, dirty. Dirty, dirty, dirty. Which brings me to our next order of business. (Kisses him)\nSheldon: Fascinating.\nAmy: I hope you don\u2019t take what I\u2019m about to do as a comment on what we just did. (Runs to bathroom and vomits)\nSheldon (to Ricky): Who\u2019s to say you shouldn\u2019t be dissecting our brains? You really are an ass.\nScene: The apartment. \nLeonard: Morning, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Oh, good, you\u2019re up. I\u2019ve written a new and improved roommate agreement that benefits me greatly. I\u2019d like you to sign it.\nLeonard: Why would I want to do that?\nSheldon: Excellent question. Do you remember what happened to the alien, played by talented character actor Frank Gorshin, in the Star Trek episode Let That Be Your Last Battlefield?\nLeonard: Uh, Captain Kirk activated the self-destruct sequence and threatened to blow up the Enterpriseand kill them both unless he gave in?\nSheldon: Affirmative. Computer, this is Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Activate self-destruct sequence. Code 1-1-A-2-B.\nFemale Voice: Self-destruct sequence activated.\nLeonard: What are you gonna do, Sheldon, blow up the apartment?\nSheldon: That was my first thought, but all my cool stuff is here.\nPriya: So what happens when it counts down?\nSheldon: Unless Leonard signs the new agreement in the next 41 seconds, this computer will send an e-mail to your parents in India saying that you\u2019re in a secret relationship with the whiter-than-marshmallow-fluff Leonard Hofstadter.\nPriya: Oh, my God.\nLeonard: What\u2019s the big deal?\nPriya: Trust me, it\u2019s a big deal.\nLeonard: They\u2019re gonna find out about me eventually, right?\nPriya: Yeah, of course, just not today.\nSheldon: 20 seconds.\nLeonard: Are you ashamed of me?\nPriya: Of course not.\nLeonard: Then why can\u2019t we tell your parents?\nPriya: Please, don\u2019t push this.\nSheldon: He does that all the time, doesn\u2019t he? 15.\nPriya: Okay, fine, Sheldon, you win. Turn it off.\nLeonard: No, he\u2019s bluffing.\nSheldon: I never bluff. Ten.\nLeonard: It\u2019s blackmail!\nSheldon: Nine.\nPriya: We give up.\nSheldon: Eight.\nLeonard: This is ridiculous. (Pulls out plug)\nSheldon: It\u2019s a laptop with a full charge. Honestly, what do you see in him?\nPriya: Give him what he wants or we\u2019re done.\nSheldon: Three.\nLeonard: Really?\nSheldon: Two.\nLeonard: Okay, I\u2019ll sign it!\nFemale Voice: Self-destruct sequence aborted.\nSheldon: You may have gone to Cambridge, but I\u2019m an honorary graduate of Starfleet academy.\nScene: The apartment. Sheldon is at his laptop. \nSheldon: Good morning, Amy.\nAmy: It most assuredly is not.\nSheldon: Are you experiencing dehydration, headache, nausea and shame?\nAmy: Yes. I also found a Korean man\u2019s business card tucked into my cleavage. What happened last night?\nSheldon: Ah, memory impairment, the free prize at the bottom of every vodka bottle.\nAmy: Sheldon?\nSheldon: All right. Last night you gave me some excellent advice regarding my problem here at home, you kissed me and then vomited on and off for 40 minutes, following which you passed out on your bathroom floor. I then folded a towel under your head as a pillow, set your oven clock to the correct time because it was driving me crazy, and I left.\nAmy: Okay. Don\u2019t really know where we go from here.\nSheldon: I suggest we treat our relationship as if it were a crashed computer and restore it to the last point we both agree it worked.\nAmy: Terrific. Thank you. (Noise of Ricky in background) They were out of menthols! Get off my back! Not easy living with a temperamental little primate.\nLeonard (off): Come on, Priya, just admit I embarrass you!\nSheldon: You\u2019re preaching to the choir, sister.\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "3_1": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: Opening shows some scenes from the final episode of the previous season, followed by the caption \u201cThree months later.\u201d Scene then opens in lobby, with the guys arriving home from the North Pole.

Sheldon is on the phone.\nSheldon: Oh, hi mom. No, I told you I\u2019d call you when I got home, I\u2019m not home yet. (Walks through door) Alright, I\u2019m home. The Arctic expedition was a remarkable success, I\u2019m all but certain there\u2019s a Nobel Prize in my future. Actually, I shouldn\u2019t say that. I\u2019m entirely certain. No, mother, I could not feel your church group praying for my safety. The fact that I\u2019m home safe is not proof that it worked, that logic is Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc. No, I\u2019m not sassing you in Eskimo talk.\nLeonard: I\u2019m going to go let Penny know we\u2019re back.\nSheldon: Mother, I have to go. Yeah, love you. Bye. (To his spot) Hello, old friend.

(They stumble, kissing, into her apartment and slam the door shut)\nHoward: Dammit, I should have gone over and told her we were back.\nRaj: Yeah, it was first come, first served.\nCredits sequence. \nScene: A moment later.\nSheldon: I just want you both to know, when I publish my findings, I won\u2019t forget your contributions.\nHoward: Great.\nRaj: Thanks.\nSheldon: Of course, I can\u2019t mention you in my Nobel acceptance speech, but when I get round to writing my memoirs you can expect a very effusive footnote, and perhaps a signed copy.\nRaj: We have to tell him.\nSheldon: Tell me what?\nHoward: Damn his Vulcan hearing.\nSheldon: You fellows are planning a party for me, aren\u2019t you?\nHoward: Okay, Sheldon, sit down.\nSheldon: If there\u2019s going to be a theme, I should let you know that I don\u2019t care for luau, toga or under the sea.\nHoward: Yeah, we\u2019ll keep that in mind, look, we need to talk to you about something that happened at the North Pole.\nSheldon: If this is about the night the heat went out, there\u2019s nothing to be embarrassed about.\nRaj: It\u2019s not about that.\nHoward: And we agreed to never speak of it again.\nSheldon: So we slept together naked. It was only to keep our core body temperatures from plummeting.\nHoward: He\u2019s speaking about it.\nRaj: For me, it was a bonding moment.\nHoward: Sheldon, you remember the first few weeks we were looking for magnetic monopoles and not finding anything and you were acting like an obnoxious, giant dictator?\nRaj: I thought we were going to be gentle with him.\nHoward: That\u2019s why I added the tator. And then when we found our first positive data, you were so happy.\nSheldon: Oh, yes. In the world of emoticons, I was colon, capital D.\nHoward: Well, in actuality, what your equipment detected wasn\u2019t so much evidence of paradigm-shifting monopoles as it was\u2026 static from the electric can opener we were turning on and off.\nRaj: He just went colon, capital O.\nSheldon: You tampered with my experiment?\nHoward: We had to.\nRaj: It was the only way to keep you from being such a huge Dickensian. You see that? I added the ensian.\nSheldon: Did Leonard know about this? Leonard\u2019s my best friend in the world. Surely Leonard didn\u2019t know.\nHoward: Actually, it was his idea.\nSheldon: Of course it was. The whole plan reeks of Leonard.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment. \nPenny: I missed you so much.\nLeonard: I missed you, too.\nPenny: I couldn\u2019t even think of anyone else while you were gone.\nLeonard: Me, neither. Except for one night when the heat went out. Long story, it\u2019s\u2026 don\u2019t ask.\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard. (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard. (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard.\nLeonard (whispering): Do not make a sound.\nSheldon: Whispering do not make a sound is a sound.\nLeonard: Damn his Vulcan hearing. Not a good time, Sheldon.\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. \nPenny: Oh, this is ridiculous. What?\nSheldon: Hello, Penny. I realize you\u2019re currently at the mercy of your primitive biological urges, but as you have an entire lifetime of poor decisions ahead of you, may I interrupt this one?\nPenny: It\u2019s great to see you too. Come on in.\nSheldon: Wolowitz has informed me of your grand deception. Do you have anything to say for yourself?\nLeonard: Yes, I feel terrible about it. I will never forgive myself, I don\u2019t expect you to either, and I would really appreciate it if you would leave me with Penny for a session of self-criticism and repentance.\nPenny: Okay, can someone please tell me what\u2019s going on here?\nSheldon: What\u2019s going on is I was led to believe I was making groundbreaking strides in science, when in fact, I was being fed false data at the hands of Wolowitz, Koothrappali and your furry little boy toy.\nPenny: Is that true?\nLeonard: It was the only way to make him happy.\nPenny: Why did you have to make him happy?\nLeonard: Because when he wasn\u2019t happy, we wanted to kill him. There was even a plan. We were going to throw his Kindle outside, and when he went to get it, lock the door and let him freeze to death.\nSheldon: That seems like a bit of an overreaction.\nLeonard: No, the overreaction was the plan to tie your limbs to four different sled dog teams and yell mush. Look, we kept the original data. You can still publish the actual results.\nSheldon: Yes, but the actual results are unsuccessful and I\u2019ve already sent an e-mail to everyone at the university explaining that I have confirmed string theory and forever changed man\u2019s understanding of the universe.\nLeonard: Aw, see, yeah, you probably shouldn\u2019t have done that. So write another e-mail, set the record straight, it\u2019s no big deal.\nSheldon: You\u2019re right, Leonard, it\u2019s not a big deal. All you did was lie to me destroy my dream and humiliate me in front of the whole university. That, FYI, was sarcasm. I, in fact, believe it is a big deal\nPenny: Oh, the poor thing.\nLeonard: Yeah, I feel terrible.\nPenny: Wait, wait. Aren\u2019t you going to go talk to him?\nLeonard: What? Uh, he\u2019ll be fine, the guy\u2019s a trouper, come here.\nPenny: No, you\u2019re right, you shouldn\u2019t talk to him. I will.\nLeonard: Man, I cannot catch a break.\nScene: Sheldon\u2019s bedroom. Penny knocks and enters.\nPenny: Hey. Do you want to talk?\nSheldon: About what? Being betrayed by my friends? Spending three months at the North Pole for nothing? And I didn\u2019t even get to go to Comic-Con!\nPenny: Oh, hon\u2026 Uh\u2026 (singing)  Soft kitty, warm kitty\u2026\nSheldon: That\u2019s for when I\u2019m sick. Sad is not sick.\nPenny: Oh. Sorry. I don\u2019t know your sad song.\nSheldon: I don\u2019t have a sad song. I\u2019m not a child.\nPenny: Well, you know, I do understand what you\u2019re going through.\nSheldon: Really? Did you just have the Nobel Prize in waitressing stolen from you?\nPenny: Well, no, but when I was a senior in high school, one of my friends heard I was going to be named head cheerleader. Oh, I was so excited. My mom even made me a celebration pie. Then they named stupid Valerie Mossbacher head cheerleader. Big ol\u2019 slutbag.\nSheldon: Are you saying that you think a celebration pie is even remotely comparable to a Nobel Prize?\nPenny: Well, they\u2019re pretty tasty.\nSheldon: And on a different, but not unrelated topic, based on your current efforts to buoy my spirits, do you truly believe that you were ever fit to be a cheer leader?\nPenny: Look, Sheldon, I just don\u2019t think that the guys and Leonard really meant to hurt you. You know? They just told an unfortunate lie to deal with a difficult situation. Okay, you know what it\u2019s like? Remember that scene in the new Star Trek movie when Kirk has to take over the ship, so he tells Spock all that stuff he knew wasn\u2019t true, like saying Spock didn\u2019t care his mom died?\nSheldon: I missed Comic-Con and the new Star Trek movie!\nScene: The university cafeteria. The guys have shaved and had haircuts. Howard has kept his moustache.\nRaj: I like the new look.\nHoward: Thanks. I call it the Clooney.\nRaj: I call it the Mario and Luigi, but whatever. Hey, how\u2019s Sheldon doing?\nLeonard: Well, he came out of his room this morning wearing his Darth Vader helmet and tried to choke me to death with the Force, so I\u2019d say, a little better.\nHoward: If I may abruptly change the subject, did you and Penny finally\u2026 you know.\nLeonard: Howard\u2026\nHoward: Personally, I don\u2019t care, but my genitals wanted me to ask.\nLeonard: Well, tell your genitals what I do with Penny is none of their business.\nHoward (to his genitals): He says they didn\u2019t do it.\nLeonard (to Sheldon, entering): Sheldon, over here. (Sheldon sits at another table and tries to choke all three to death with the force. Raj pretends he is choking.) \nHoward: What are you doing?\nRaj: I feel bad for the guy.\nLeonard: Sheldon, why are you sitting by yourself?\nSheldon: Because I am without friends. Like the proverbial cheese, I stand alone. Even while seated.\nLeonard: Come on. We said we were sorry.\nSheldon: It\u2019s going to take more than I\u2019m sorry and a store-bought apology pie from Penny to make up for what you\u2019ve done to me.\nKripke (arriving): Hey, Cooper. Wead your wetwaction e-mail. Way to destroy your weputation.\nSheldon: You see? People have been pointing and laughing at me all morning.\nKripke: That\u2019s not twue. People have been pointing and waughing at you your whole wife.\nSheldon: All right, I\u2019ve had enough. Attention, everyone. I\u2019 m Dr. Sheldon Cooper. As many of you in the physics department might know, my career trajectory has taken a minor detour.\nKripke: Off a cwiff.\nSheldon: My credibility may have been damaged\u2026\nKripke: Compwetely wecked.\nSheldon: But I would like to remind you that in science, there\u2019s no such thing as failure. There once was a man who referred to his prediction of a cosmological constant as the single biggest blunder of his career. That man\u2019s name was, surprise, surprise, Albert Einstein.\nKripke: Yeah, but wesearch into Dark Energy pwoved that Einstein\u2019s cosmowogical constant was actually wight all along, so you\u2019re still, surpwise, surpwise, a woser.\nSheldon: Oh, you think you\u2019re so clever. Well, let me just tell you, while I do not currently have a scathing retort, you check your e-mail periodically for a doozy.\nLeonard: So much for our friendship with Sheldon.\nRaj: Well, we\u2019ll always have the night the heat went out.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment.\nPenny: Hi.\nLeonard: Hey. Listen, since we got, you know, interrupted last night, I didn\u2019t have a chance to give you this.\nPenny: Oh, Leonard, you shouldn\u2019t have. Oh, boy! What is it?\nLeonard: It\u2019s a snowflake. From the North Pole.\nPenny: Are you serious?\nLeonard: Uh-huh. It\u2019ll last forever. I preserved it in a one percent solution of polyvinyl acetal resin.\nPenny: Oh, my God. That\u2019s the most romantic thing anyone\u2019s ever said to me that I didn\u2019t understand.\nLeonard: It\u2019s actually a pretty simple process. You see, cyanoacrylate are monomers which polymerize on\u2026 (she kisses him) \nHoward (arriving): Red alert, Leonard. Sheldon ran away.\nLeonard: Man, I can not catch a break.\nPenny: So, how do you know he ran away?\nHoward: Well, he\u2019s not answering his phone, he handed in his resignation at the university and he sent me a text that said, I\u2019m running away.\nLeonard: Okay, well, thanks for letting me know.\nPenny: Well, Leonard, aren\u2019t you going to do something?\nLeonard: Of course I\u2019m going to do something. Uh, Howard, you check the comic book store. Raj, go to the Thai restaurant. I\u2019ll stay here with Penny in her apartment. (His phone rings) Oh, damn it. It\u2019s Sheldon\u2019s mother. A break cannot be caught. Hi, Mrs. Cooper. He is? Sheldon went home to Texas. Yeah, no, I know he resigned. Yes, I guess it kind of is our fault. No, no, no, you, you\u2019re right, someone needs to come talk to him. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll take care of it. Yeah. All right. New plan. Howard, you and Raj go to Texas. I\u2019ll stay here with Penny in her apartment.\nPenny: Well, you\u2019re not gonna go with them?\nLeonard: Well, you know, I gave you the snowflake and we were kissing and\u2026 Oh, come on, I don\u2019t want to go to Texas!\nHoward: Oh, right, and I do? My people already crossed a desert once, we\u2019re done.\nLeonard: Trust me, you\u2019ll be fine. See ya.\nPenny: Well, wait a second, Leonard, come on, how can you not go? He\u2019s your best friend.\nLeonard: Yeah, but I already saw him naked. Just come here.\nPenny: No. I promise I will be here when you get back. Just go help Sheldon.\nLeonard: Really?\nPenny: Yeah. We waited a few months. We can wait a few more days.\nLeonard: Maybe you can.\nPenny: Go.\nRaj: Boy, you cannot catch a break, can you?\nScene: Sheldon\u2019s mother\u2019s kitchen. \n\u00a0\nMrs Cooper: Here you go, Shelly.\nSheldon: Thanks, Mom.\nMrs Cooper: Hold your horses, young man. Here in Texas, we pray before we eat.\nSheldon: Aw, Mom.\nMrs Cooper: This is not California, land of the heathen. Gimme. By His hand we are all\u2026\nSheldon: Fed.\nMrs Cooper: Give us, Lord, our daily\u2026\nSheldon: Bread.\nMrs Cooper: Please know that we are truly\u2026\nSheldon: Grateful.\nMrs Cooper: For every cup and every\u2026\nSheldon: Plateful.\nMrs Cooper: Amen. Now, that wasn\u2019t so hard, was it?\nSheldon: My objection was based on considerations other than difficulty.\nMrs Cooper: Whatever. Jesus still loves you.\nSheldon: Thank you for carving a smiley face in my grilled cheese sandwich.\nMrs Cooper: Oh, I know how to take care of my baby. His eyes came out a little thin, but you can just pretend he\u2019s Chinese. So, do you want to talk about what happened with you and your little friends?\nSheldon: They\u2019re not my friends.\nMrs Cooper: All right. If you recall, when you were little, we sat right here at this very spot and we talked about some of the problems you had getting along with the neighbour kids.\nSheldon: That was different. They were threatened by my intelligence and too stupid to know that\u2019s why they hated me.\nMrs Cooper: Oh baby, they knew very well why they hated you.\nScene: A rental car.\n\u00a0\nLeonard: I can\u2019t believe you bought a red cowboy hat.\nHoward: Hello? I\u2019m wearing a red turtleneck. Plus, it was the only boys\u2019 large they had.\nRaj: I\u2019m sorry, this does not look like Texas. Where\u2019s the tumbleweeds? Where\u2019s the saloons?\nLeonard: Saloons?\nRaj: Yeah, like in the movies I saw growing up in India. You know, uh, Four for Texas, Yellow Rose of Texas.\nHoward: This neighbourhood is more Texas Chainsaw Massacre.\nRaj: I was really hoping to see a cattle drive.\nLeonard: What can I tell you? They probably have steaks on sale at that big-ass Costco over there.\nScene: Sheldon\u2019s mother\u2019s house.\nLeonard: Will you please take that stupid hat off?\nHoward: No, I want to blend in.\nRaj: To what? Toy Story?\nMrs Cooper: Hi, boys.\nHoward: Howdy, ma\u2019am.\nMrs Cooper: Howdy to you, too. You got here quick.\nLeonard: \u2013 We took the red-eye.\nMrs Cooper: Well, come on in.\nHoward: Thank you kindly.\nMrs Cooper: Can I\u2026 Can I get you something to drink?\nLeonard: Uh, no, thank you.\nHoward: If y\u2019all don\u2019t mind, I got a hankerin\u2019 for a Lone Star beer.\nMrs Cooper: There\u2019s no alcohol in this household. Stop talking like that and lose the hat.\nHoward: Sorry. I\u2019ll take a diet Yoo-Hoo if you have it.\nMrs Cooper: You\u2019ll take a Cola.* What about you? Radge, isn\u2019t it? Oh, you still having trouble talking to the ladies? Because, you know, at our church we have a woman who\u2019s an amazing healer. Mostly she does, uh, crutch and wheelchair people, but I bet she\u2019d be willing to take a shot at whatever Third World demon is running around inside of you.\nLeonard: Uh, if you don\u2019t mind, Mrs. Cooper, there\u2019s a 3:05 nonstop back to Los Angeles, and you have no idea how much I want to be on it.\nMrs Cooper: A girl?\nLeonard: Uh, yes, ma\u2019am.\nMrs Cooper: Oh, good. I\u2019ve been praying for you. Oh, Sheldon.\nSheldon: What are they doing here?\nLeonard: We came to apologize.\nHoward: Again.\nLeonard: And bring you home. So, why don\u2019t you pack up your stuff and we\u2019ll head back.\nLeonard: No, this is my home now. Thanks to you, my career is over and I will spend the rest of my life here in Texas trying to teach evolution to creationists.\nMrs Cooper: You watch your mouth, Shelly. Everyone\u2019s entitled to their opinion.\nSheldon: Evolution isn\u2019t an opinion, it\u2019s fact.\nMrs Cooper: And that is your opinion.\nSheldon: I forgive you. Let\u2019s go home.\nMrs Cooper: Don\u2019t tell me prayer doesn\u2019t work.\nScene: In Penny\u2019s bed.\nLeonard: How about that? I finally caught a break.\nPenny: Uh-huh.\nLeonard: You know how they say when friends have sex it can get weird?\nPenny: Sure.\nLeonard: Why does it have to get weird?\nPenny: I don\u2019t know.\nLeonard: I mean, we were friends, and now we\u2019re more than friends. We\u2019re whatever this is. But why label it, right? I mean, it is what it is and\u2026\nPenny: Leonard?\nLeonard: Yeah?\nPenny: It\u2019s weird.\nLeonard: Totally.\n(* This scene was originally filmed using the word \u201ccoke\u201d but it was overdubbed for television purposes. On the DVD version, the original is used.)\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "9_1": "\n\t\t\t\tFollowing a \u201cpreviously on\u201d sequence.\nScene: A Wedding Chapel.\nPenny: So, what package are you thinking?\nLeonard: Mm, this one comes with music and flowers. Oh, they even stream the whole thing live on the Internet.\nPenny: Why would we want that?\nLeonard: \u2018Cause there\u2019s a lot of gorgeous blondes out there who don\u2019t believe they can land a short, nearsighted scientist. Let\u2019s give them hope.\nPenny: Whatever. Put us on the Internet. I\u2019ve always wanted a wedding with a comment section.\nLeonard: If you\u2019re not into this, we can do it another time.\nPenny: No. No, I want to. Look, we\u2019ve put this off long enough. Let\u2019s do it.\nLeonard: Aw. That\u2019s exactly what you said the first time we slept together. (Phone) Oh, excuse me. Sheldon. Hey.\nSheldon: Leonard, have you gotten married yet?\nLeonard: No. Why?\nSheldon: Good. Don\u2019t do it.\nLeonard: Why not?\nSheldon: Some important new information has come to light. Women are the worst. I thought it was paper cuts, but I was wrong. No piece of paper ever cut me this deep.\nLeonard: What happened now?\nSheldon: Amy has ended our relationship.\nLeonard: Oh, no. Seriously?\nPenny: What\u2019s going on?\nLeonard: Amy broke up with Sheldon.\nPenny: She did?\nSheldon: Is Penny crying?\nLeonard: No.\nSheldon: No, of course not. They thrive on our suffering.\nLeonard: Buddy, I\u2019m so sorry. Is there anything I can do?\nSheldon: Yes. If I ever talk about going out with a girl again, roll your eyes at me like I do to you when you say dumb things.\nLeonard: Sheldon, uh, okay, just because you\u2019re going through this with Amy doesn\u2019t mean that all women are bad.\nSheldon: Whatever.\nPenny (on phone): Hey, I just heard about you and Sheldon. Are you okay?\nAmy: Not really. Can you come over?\nPenny: Uh, actually I\u2019m in Vegas. Leonard and I are about to get married.\nAmy: Hold on. You\u2019re getting married and you didn\u2019t invite me?\nPenny: Well, it was kind of a spur-of-the-moment thing.\nAmy: Wow. Hope I can catch the bouquet from here.\nPenny: Amy, don\u2019t be like that.\nSheldon: Why did I just hear Amy\u2019s name?\nLeonard: Penny\u2019s on the phone with her.\nSheldon: Did she say anything about me? Never mind. I don\u2019t care. Well, if you care, you can find out and tell me. Just don\u2019t be shocked when you find out that I don\u2019t care.\nPenny: Okay, will you relax? You\u2019re not missing anything special.\nLeonard: Hey.\nPenny: She\u2019s upset. Look, it\u2019s gonna be a great wedding. Look at you in your little suit.\nSheldon: Amy\u2019s upset? Is it about me?\nLeonard: No, I think it\u2019s because we\u2019re eloping.\nSheldon: Your marriage is causing her pain? Yeah, great, I take it back. Go ahead and do it. Yay for love.\nCredits sequence. \nScene: Outside Amy\u2019s apartment. \nSheldon: Hello.\nAmy: Oh. What are you doing here?\nSheldon: When last we spoke, you said you needed time.\nAmy: Well, it\u2019s only been 11 hours.\nSheldon: The Lord of the Rings trilogy was nearly 11 hours. I made you watch that, you said it was an eternity.\nAmy: Sheldon, when I\u2019m ready to talk, I\u2019ll let you know.\nSheldon: Very well. You seem to be headed somewhere. May I walk with you?\nAmy: Sure.\nSheldon: Boy, I\u2019m glad we\u2019re going out again.\nAmy: We\u2019re not back together.\nSheldon: Why? Is there someone else? Just couldn\u2019t wait for that first notch on your bedpost, could you?\nAmy: If you must know, I\u2019m going to Howard and Bernadette\u2019s to watch the wedding.\nSheldon: And who\u2019s this guy you\u2019re taking?\nAmy: There\u2019s no guy.\nSheldon: Oh, you\u2019re going to a wedding alone? That\u2019s sad.\nAmy: I\u2019m not gonna be alone. I\u2019ll be with my friends.\nSheldon: Your friends? Well, I think you mean my friends. And why wasn\u2019t I invited to this?\nAmy: Maybe because the two of us being there would make them feel awkward.\nSheldon: We make everyone feel awkward. That\u2019s our thing.\nScene: The Wedding Chapel. \nLeonard: They\u2019re running a little behind. Should be pretty soon.\nPenny: Okay.\nLeonard: Hey, if you\u2019re hungry, there\u2019s a breakfast buffet at the strip club next door.\nPenny: Thanks, but I don\u2019t like glitter on my scrambled eggs.\nLeonard: I don\u2019t think the strippers prepare the meal, but okay. Look, it\u2019s not how I pictured it either, but I\u2019m still glad we\u2019re doing it.\nPenny: Me, too.\nLeonard: You sure?\nPenny: Yes.\nLeonard: And you promise you\u2019re okay with everything from the car?\nPenny: Oh, my God, would you stop bringing it up?\nLeonard: You\u2019re right. I\u2019m sorry. We have the rest of our lives to dredge stuff up from the past and fight about it. So what do you think? Should we run next door and grab a bite?\nPenny: What if they call our names?\nLeonard: Oh, don\u2019t worry. They gave me this vibrating coaster.\nPenny: Oh, and the fairy tale continues.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s House.\nAmy: Thank you for doing this.\nBernadette: Our pleasure. You feeling okay?\nAmy: We were together for so long, I honestly don\u2019t know what I\u2019m feeling.\nHoward: Well, that\u2019s understandable. You forgot. It\u2019s called happy.\nBernadette: Howard.\nHoward: I\u2019m not saying anything bad. Just that she was in love with her captor and somehow managed to escape from his dark and crazy dungeon.\nStuart: I know what you\u2019re going through. My, my, my last breakup was pretty tough.\nAmy: Oh. What was her name?\nStuart: Hey, it\u2019s a true story. I don\u2019t need the third degree.\nBernadette: For God\u2019s sake, Sheldon, what are you doing?\nSheldon: I didn\u2019t want to come in. I was told it would make everyone feel uncomfortable. So I\u2019ll just stay out here and pretend that I don\u2019t have to go to the bathroom.\nBernadette: Howard, do something.\nHoward: I\u2019m on it.\nAmy: Sheldon, you being here might not be making things better.\nSheldon: I see. And is that why everybody was invited but me?\nAmy: They didn\u2019t invite everybody but you.Bernadette invited me, and Stuart lives here.\nRaj: Who wants hot cinnamon rolls?\nScene: The Wedding Chapel.\nOfficial: So, when you hear the music, that\u2019s your cue. Any questions?\nLeonard: Oh, the package that we paid for said the aisle was supposed to be strewn with rose petals.\nOfficial: Where are the rose petals?!\nFemale Voice We\u2019re out\nLeonard: You know what? It\u2019s fine.\nFemale Voice: We can use the potpourri from the bathroom!\nPenny: Really, we\u2019re good.\nLeonard: Yup, just want to get married.\nPenny: Yeah.\nOfficial: Great. I\u2019ll see you two up there.\nLeonard: This is it.\nPenny: I know.\nLeonard: I love you.\nPenny: I love you, too.\nFemale Voice: Was that a yes or no on the potpourri?\nPenny: No, thank you.\nLeonard: We\u2019re good.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s House.\nSheldon: Raj, you\u2019re probably wondering why Amy and I aren\u2019t showing any affection to one another.\nRaj: Didn\u2019t even crack the top ten.\nSheldon: Well, you should know that she recently broke up with me.\nAmy: I said I needed time to think.\nRaj: I\u2019m sure you guys will figure something out.\nSheldon: You hear that? Raj is devastated.\nBernadette: Sheldon, shh. The wedding\u2019s starting.\nSheldon: I see what\u2019s happening. Sides are forming. Well, if Bernadette\u2019s on Amy\u2019s team, I pick Howard.\nHoward: I\u2019m not taking sides.\nSheldon: Fine, I guess I\u2019m stuck with Raj.\nRaj: Really?\nStuart: At least you got picked.\nScene: The Wedding Chapel.\nOfficial: Before I go any further, have either of you prepared your own vows?\nLeonard: Yes.\nPenny: No. You wrote vows?\nLeonard: Yeah.\nPenny: Well, I don\u2019t have any. You\u2019re kind of making me look bad.\nLeonard: It\u2019s okay. I don\u2019t have to say them.\nPenny: No, no, no, go ahead. I\u2019ll come up with something mushy, you\u2019ll cry, we got this.\nLeonard: Penny, we are made of particles that have existed since the moment the universe began. I like to think those atoms travelled 14 billion years through time and space to create us, so that we could be together and make each other whole.\nPenny: Wow.\nOfficial: Penny?\nPenny: Right. Um, okay. Leonard, I mean, you\u2019re not only the love of my life. I mean, you\u2019re my best friend, and, you\u2019ve got a friend in me. You got troubles. I got \u2019em, too. There isn\u2019t anything I wouldn\u2019t do for you. We stick together, and we can see it through, \u2019cause you\u2019ve got a friend in me.\nOfficial: Is that the song from Toy Story?\nPenny: He loves that movie.\nLeonard: I do.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s house.\nBernadette: Aw, that was beautiful.\nHoward: Yeah. I mean, not like our wedding beautiful.\nBernadette: No, we totally won.\nSheldon: Amy, I don\u2019t understand, are we broken up or not? It\u2019s like you can\u2019t make up your mind.\nAmy: It\u2019s because you\u2019re not giving me any space to think.\nSheldon: Well, you should think fast, because men can sire offspring their entire lives, but those eggs you\u2019re toting around have a sell-by date.\nAmy: You know what, Sheldon, you\u2019ve made this really easy. You\u2019re immature, you\u2019re selfish, you just insulted me to my face. I don\u2019t need any more time to think. We\u2019re broken up.\nBernadette: Amy.\nSheldon: Will someone take me home?\nRaj: Yeah. Come on, I\u2019ll give you a ride.\nOfficial (voice from computer) \u2026symbolizes your eternal love. I now pronounce you husband and wife.\nPenny: We did it.\nLeonard: Yeah, I\u2019m so glad you guys could watch.\nHoward: We\u2019ll say it was beautiful in the comment section.\nScene: Hotel corridor.\nLeonard: No, no, no. Hang on. I believe I\u2019m supposed to carry you across the threshold.\nPenny: Can you?\nLeonard: Who do you think carries Sheldon to bed when he falls asleep in front of the TV?\nPenny: Okay, let\u2019s do it. You gonna make it?\nLeonard: I\u2019m okay.\nPenny: Nicely done.\nLeonard: Thank you. Finally, there\u2019s a Mrs. Hofstadter who isn\u2019t disappointed in me.\nPenny: Well, the night is still young.\nLeonard: Everything all right?\nPenny: Yeah. I guess.\nLeonard: Just tell me.\nPenny: It\u2019s just, when we were kissing, I couldn\u2019t help but picture you with that other girl.\nLeonard: Oh, no. No, come on. I have a friend in you. You said so.\nPenny: You\u2019re right. Just forget it.\nLeonard: Yeah. Okay, listen. If you\u2019re imagining that it was sexy, it wasn\u2019t. We, we were both drunk, and she smelled like an ashtray. The boat was moving a lot, so I chipped her tooth.\nPenny: Did you feel guilty?\nLeonard: No, she had dental insurance.\nPenny: Did you feel guilty after kissing her?\nLeonard: Yes. I felt guilty as soon as it happened. I feel guilty every time I see her.\nPenny: What do you mean, every time you see her?\nLeonard: What do I mean? Boy, that\u2019s a toughie.\nPenny: You still see her?\nLeonard: Well, no, not socially. But, you know, just at work.\nPenny: You work with her? How could you not tell me that?\nLeonard: I wanted to tell you in the car, but you told me to stop talking\nPenny: Oh, okay. So you\u2019re saying this is my fault?\nLeonard: No, of course not. Okay, look, instead of fighting, why don\u2019t we dim the lights, um, get naked and make a baby? I was trying to lighten the mood. It\u2019s not easy. You try it.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon (on phone): Hello, Mother.\nMrs Cooper: Shelly! How\u2019s my baby doing?\nSheldon: I just wanted to let you know that you can remove Amy from your nightly prayers. Unless you\u2019re open to praying for a beehive to fall on her head.\nMrs Cooper: Oh, what\u2019s going on?\nSheldon: She broke up with me.\nMrs Cooper: Oh, Shelly.\nSheldon: No, I\u2019ll be okay. But I think that I\u2019d like to send the ring back to you.\nMrs Cooper: Well, let\u2019s not be hasty. Are you sure it\u2019s over for good?\nSheldon: It\u2019s over for me. I\u2019m done with women. Like when I swore off Pop Rocks. They both hurt you on purpose.\nMrs Cooper: You want to tell me what happened?\nSheldon: Are you going to say it\u2019s all part of God\u2019s plan?\nMrs Cooper: Good chance.\nSheldon: Then no, thank you.\nMrs Cooper: Well, honey, don\u2019t send it back yet. Your sister\u2019s married, and I\u2019m not letting your brother give my grandmother\u2019s ring to that whore he\u2019s dating.\nSheldon: Wasn\u2019t Mary Magdalene a woman of ill repute?\nMrs Cooper: When your idiot brother redeems mankind, he can date whoever he wants.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s house.\nBernadette: I know it hurts now, but it\u2019s gonna get better.\nAmy: Yeah.\nHoward: Everything\u2019s gonna be okay.\nStuart: You\u2019ve got so much to offer.\nAmy: Thank you.\nStuart: Any man would be lucky to have you.\nBernadette: That\u2019s true.\nAmy: I just hope I did the right thing.\nStuart: I\u2019m sure you did. Maybe that\u2019s the problem, you always do the right thing. Maybe it\u2019s time to do the wrong thing.\nAmy: Like you\u2019re doing right now?\nStuart: Exactly.\nScene: The stairwell. \nLeonard: I asked you over and over if you were okay. Why would you go through with the wedding if you weren\u2019t?\nPenny: I thought I was okay, but it turns out I\u2019m not.\nLeonard: Okay, listen, I may not have been entirely faithful, but you, you are not easy to lift.\nSheldon: Wow. Well, marriage must agree with you. Well, you are just glowing.\nLeonard: I\u2019m not glowing. I\u2019m upset.\nSheldon: Well, whatever it is, it agrees with you.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment.\nSheldon (outside): Knock, knock, knock, Penny? Knock, knock, knock, Penny? Knock, knock, knock, Penny?\nPenny: What\u2019s this?\nSheldon: Leonard told me what happened, so I took it upon myself to make you a hot beverage.\nPenny: Oh. That\u2019s so sweet of you.\nSheldon: Yeah. I know. Turns out, being sweet isn\u2019t enough to keep a girl these days. I blame Madonna.\nPenny: I\u2019m sorry to hear about you and Amy.\nSheldon: Well, I\u2019m sorry about Leonard. Thought I raised him better than that.\nPenny: You know, it\u2019s bad enough what happened, but then he tried to hide the fact that he sees her all the time at the university.\nSheldon: He does? Who is it?\nPenny: Some girl named Mandy.\nSheldon: Mandy Chao?\nPenny: Yeah.\nSheldon: Oh, you don\u2019t need to worry about her. She\u2019s brilliant and attractive. She can do way better\nthan Leonard.\nPenny: That\u2019s great.\nSheldon: Wait a minute. I know this may sound far fetched, but I\u2019m on the market now. You know, if I dated Mandy, that would teach both Leonard and Amy a lesson.\nPenny: That\u2019s ridiculous.\nSheldon: Oh, you\u2019re right. I could never be with a woman whose self-esteem was so low she\u2019d be with Leonard.\nPenny: I\u2019m with Leonard.\nSheldon: Yeah, I know. Forever. Who would have believed these things would happen to us?\nPenny: Right? I can\u2019t believe Amy actually went through with it.\nSheldon: Hang on. You knew that she was going to end it with me? Did you try and stop her?\nPenny: I told her to be true to herself and do what makes her happy.\nSheldon: Do what makes her happy? She plays the harp and her car is paid for. How much happier can she be?\nPenny: Okay, look, it\u2019s not my fault that she thought you were a bad boyfriend.\nSheldon: I see. Well, I think I\u2019ll be going.\nPenny: Sheldon.\nSheldon: No, no, no, no. We are done here. Would you mind opening the door and then angrily slamming it behind me?\nPenny: Sure.\nSheldon: Thank you. And slam it hard, because I am pretty steamed.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s house.\nHoward (on phone): All right, Leonard, hang in there. Talk to you tomorrow.\nBernadette: What happened? They just got married.\nHoward: I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s a mess. They had a huge fight in Vegas.\nBernadette: Think they\u2019ll break up?\nHoward: I don\u2019t know. Sounds pretty bad. Penny\u2019s back in her apartment all by herself.\nStuart: Really?\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Would you like to hear another reason why men are better than women?\nLeonard: Sure, let\u2019s make it an even hundred.\nSheldon: You would never kiss me and make me say I love you and then break up with me.\nLeonard: I wouldn\u2019t.\nSheldon: And you know why? \u2018Cause you\u2019re a man. The champagne of genders.\nLeonard: Well, I may be a man, but I think I\u2019m the one that screwed up on this one.\nSheldon: Yeah, well, and you admit it, like a man. All you hear women say is, I\u2019ll just have a salad. You know? Where\u2019s my lip gloss? I think this element should be called radium. That last one was Madame Curie.\nLeonard: I figured that out.\nSheldon: You know what? She was kind of an honorary man. She had a penis made of science.\nLeonard: Can\u2019t believe I\u2019m spending my wedding night with you.\nSheldon: Really? I never imagined it any other way.\n\u00a0\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "6_12": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Well, I must say, Leonard, when I first heard your idea for Giant Jenga, I was sceptical.\nLeonard: I can\u2019t blame you. Tiny Twister was a complete bust.\nSheldon: No, I was wrong. The looming threat of being crushed under a pile of lumber does add a certain spice. I\u2019ve never felt so alive. (Answers door) Oh, hello, Alex. Uh, let me go get you last night\u2019s recordings.\nLeonard: What recordings?\nSheldon: Well, you remember when you told me I talk in my sleep? Well, it occurred to me that, like most things I say, it\u2019s probably pure gold. So I started recording it all, and now Alex gets to comb through eight hours of what I like to call Sheldon After Dark.\nAlex: Hey, Leonard.\nLeonard: Hey. Just playing a little Giant Jenga here.\nAlex: Oh, I know, I\u2019m the one who had to buy him the helmet. So, do you have any plans this weekend?\nLeonard: Well, most of Saturday\u2019s gonna be figuring out where to put this game when we\u2019re done. How about you?\nAlex: Oh, I\u2019m gonna go see Kip Thorne give a lecture on subatomic space-time.\nLeonard: Ooh. That\u2019s his take on John Wheeler\u2019s quantum foam. That should be great.\nAlex: Well, if you want, you can come with me.\nLeonard: Ah, I\u2019d love to, but I\u2019m supposed to hang out with Penny.\nAlex: Well, bring her.\nLeonard: Well, she\u2019s not really into that kind of stuff.\nAlex: Yeah, okay. Well, if you want to hear about the lecture, I can tell you all about it at work, or, you know, over dinner sometime.\nLeonard (jumping and knocking over the Jenga): What?\nSheldon: Jenga, I win!\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The cafeteria.\nHoward: Oh, come on, that can\u2019t be true.\nRaj: I did the research. Tony the Tiger, Dig\u2019em the Frog, Cap\u2019n Crunch, Toucan Sam, Count Chocula, Trix the Rabbit, Snap, Crackle and Pop. Not one cereal mascot is a girl. It\u2019s a total breakfast sausage fest.\nLeonard: Are we done with this?\nRaj: Almost. Franken Berry, Boo Berry, Sugar Bear and the Honey Nut Cheerio bee, I believe his name is Buzz.\nLeonard: Terrific. Something weird happened and I don\u2019t know what to do about it.\nHoward: What\u2019s going on?\nLeonard: Sheldon\u2019s assistant asked me on a date last night.\nRaj: How could you do that to me? You know I\u2019ve been working it with Alex for weeks.\nLeonard: Working it? You can\u2019t even talk to her.\nRaj: I talk with my eyes.\nHoward: You look like my little cousin when he\u2019s dropping one in his diaper.\nLeonard: She knows I have a girlfriend. It\u2019s so weird.\nRaj: Oh, my God. You\u2019re loving this.\nLeonard: To my bones. I mean, I\u2019m not gonna do anything about it. I love Penny. It\u2019s just nice to have a young, attractive woman sniffing around the goods.\nRaj: I both hate you and want to be you. This is Ryan Gosling all over again.\nSheldon: Ah, gentlemen, what is on the conversational menu this morning?\nRaj: Leonard stole my woman, and he knew full well I was only six to eight months away from making my move.\nLeonard: I didn\u2019t steal anyone.\nRaj: Your assistant is totally hitting on this jerk and he loves it.\nSheldon: Well, that\u2019s not acceptable. I mean, I\u2019m her boss. She needs to be solely focused on my needs, not distracted by your pasty, androgynous brand of sexuality.\nLeonard: I\u2019m androgynous?\nSheldon: Oh, please. Look at you with your pouty bee-stung lips.\nLeonard: What do you guys think I should do?\nRaj: I say you tell Alex your heart belongs to Penny, I provide her a shoulder to cry on, and then roughly half a year later I give it to her good.\nScene: Amy\u2019s apartment.\nSheldon: I want to thank you all for coming on such short notice. Uh, in the past, I\u2019ve reached out to each of you individually, but I believe my present situation requires the collective wisdom of the group, which as you can see from your commemorative T-shirts I have dubbed Sheldon Cooper\u2019s Council of Ladies.\nPenny: What is happening?\nSheldon: I need your advice about a delicate workplace situation. Uh, to protect those involved, I\u2019ll be changing their names.\nBernadette: Who\u2019s involved?\nSheldon: Well, a short, bespectacled colleague of mine who lives in the shadow of his brilliant roommate. Let\u2019s call this colleague Ricardo Shilly-Shally.\nPenny: You\u2019re talking about Leonard.\nSheldon: No, no, Shilly-Shally has red hair and, uh, he briefly served in the Mexican Navy. Anyway, despite the fact that he has a girlfriend, Shilly-Shally has been the recipient of inappropriate workplace flirtations from a young lady.\nAmy: It\u2019s your assistant Alex, isn\u2019t it?\nSheldon: No. No. No. This is Tondelaya della Ventimiglia.\nPenny: Wait, what the hell\u2019s going on with Leonard and Alex?\nSheldon: No, uh, no, I\u2019m sorry. Who\u2019s talking about Leonard and Alex?\nPenny: Fine. Ricardo and Tondelaya.\nSheldon: Okay, look, it\u2019s not really about Ricardo and Tondelaya. It is really about her boss, who doesn\u2019t quite know how to handle this situation and could use your advice, which is surprising because Dr. Einstein Von Brainstorm, he\u2019s usually pretty smart about these things.\nPenny: I\u2019m gonna kill her.\nBernadette: I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve got nothing to worry about. Leonard would never cheat on you.\nAmy: She\u2019s right. But say the word, I got a lab full of cocaine-addicted monkeys with nothing to lose. One of them could end up in the backseat of her car. Or her shower.\nSheldon: Ladies, ladies, please. We\u2019re not here to talk about Penny, okay? We\u2019re here to talk about me. Uh, I mean Einstein Von Brainstorm. Oh, darn it! All right, I guess the cat\u2019s out of the bag. Let me explain what\u2019s going on. Ricardo is really Leonard.\nPenny: We know what\u2019s going on, Sheldon!\nSheldon: Well, what should I do?\nBernadette: Well, Alex is your employee. If she\u2019s doing something that\u2019s making Leonard uncomfortable, you should talk to her.\nSheldon: Oh, no, he\u2019s not uncomfortable at all. No, he\u2019s loving it. Yeah, he\u2019s strutting around like he\u2019s five-foot-six.\nPenny: What? He\u2019s loving it?\nBernadette: Sheldon, you need to talk to Alex right away.\nSheldon: Talk to her? That\u2019s all you\u2019ve got? With a cool name like Sheldon Cooper\u2019s Council of Ladies, I really expected more. Give me back the T-shirts.\nScene: Sheldon\u2019s office.\nSheldon: Alex, check my schedule. What does my afternoon look like?\nAlex: I think it\u2019s pretty wide open. Oh, wait. Here\u2019s something at four o\u2019clock. Give Alex a talking to?\nSheldon: Well, that snuck up on us, didn\u2019t it?\nAlex: Is there a problem?\nSheldon: Let\u2019s not call it a problem. Let\u2019s call it an opportunity. To solve a serious problem.\nAlex: What did I do?\nSheldon: You don\u2019t know? Oh, you poor dear. Your ovaries are squirting so much goofy juice into your brains you don\u2019t even know which way is up. You made an inappropriate sexual advance towards Dr. Hofstadter.\nAlex: What? I didn\u2019t make a sexual advance on anybody.\nSheldon: Now, there\u2019s no need to get defensive. I\u2019m not unsympathetic to your plight. My father used to say that a woman is like an egg salad sandwich on a warm Texas day.\nAlex: What?\nSheldon: Full of eggs and only appealing for a short time.\nAlex: This conversation is making me uncomfortable.\nSheldon: Yeah, you and me both, sister. Now, please understand, I don\u2019t hold you responsible for your behaviour because, see, from an evolutionary standpoint, you\u2019re a slave to your desire to reproduce. But during the work day, when you feel possessed by amorous intent, may I suggest that you suppress it by leafing through this illustrated book of sexually transmitted diseases? Let\u2019s see here. Oh, yes. Check out this oozy doozy.\nAlex: I have to go.\nSheldon: So does this fellow, but he can\u2019t without it burning like hot soup.\nScene: The stairwell.\nLeonard: Hey, pretty lady.\nPenny: Oh, you seem extra happy.\nLeonard: Uh, I guess I am.\nPenny: Any particular reason why?\nLeonard: I don\u2019t know, just having a good day. This morning Sheldon fell asleep on the way to work, so I got to listen to the radio. That was pretty crazy.\nPenny: Mm-hmm. Anything else?\nLeonard: Mm. I found this quiz online called Which Star Trek Character Are You? and it only took me four tries to get Captain Kirk.\nPenny: That\u2019s great.\nLeonard: Oh. It. Was.\nPenny: Hmm. Well, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re having such a great day.\nLeonard: Yeah. And the one thing that could make it even better is an evening with my special girl.\nPenny: Oh, and who\u2019s that?\nLeonard: What do you mean?\nPenny: Oh, I just didn\u2019t know if you meant me or Alex.\nLeonard: Um, why would I mean Alex?\nPenny: Because I know she hit on you and I know you liked it.\nLeonard: What?\nPenny: Don\u2019t play dumb with me, Ricardo Shilly-Shally!\nLeonard: I\u2019m missing something. (Enters apartment. To Sheldon) Did you say something to Penny about Alex?\nSheldon: Oh, yes. Yeah, and a fat lot of good it did me. All she did was get mad at you.\nLeonard: Why would you do that?\nSheldon: I needed advice about a woman. I would have asked you, but if the last few years have proven anything, it\u2019s that you can\u2019t tell a uterus from a unicycle.\nLeonard: At least I know not to blab to a girl about somebody flirting with her boyfriend.\nSheldon: Good to know. Yeah, a few more helpful hints like that, you may find yourself on the Council of Ladies. (Answering phone) Hello. I see. Uh, what time? Very well, then. Huh. That was the Human Resources Department at the university. Apparently, my assistant Alex has filed a complaint accusing me of inappropriate behaviour in the workplace.\nLeonard: Oh, my God, what did you do?\nSheldon: Hmm, let me think. Nothing. I\u2019m a delight.\nScene: The Human Resources Department.\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Human Resources Department. (Knock, knock, knock) Human Resources Department. (Knock, knock, knock) Human Resources Department.\nHR Woman: Come in.\nSheldon: Hello.\nHR Woman: Ah, Dr. Cooper, have a seat.\nSheldon: Thank you.\nHR Woman: I called you in today because your assistant Alex Jensen has lodged a complaint against you.\nSheldon: So I\u2019ve been told. But I can\u2019t understand what she has to complain about. I mean, she has a front-row seat as I make scientific history. There\u2019s string cheese in my mini-fridge, and that\u2019s for anyone. Yeah, and just yesterday I led her away from a life of sexual promiscuity by making her look at pictures of disease-ridden genitalia.\nHR Woman: Cancel my next appointment. This is gonna take a while. Dr. Cooper, you said things to your employee that you just cannot say in the workplace.\nSheldon: Like what?\nHR Woman: Well, according to Ms. Jensen, you said that she was a slave to her biological urges and called her an egg salad sandwich. I don\u2019t even know what that means, but I\u2019m gonna go ahead and tell you you can\u2019t say it.\nSheldon: Oh! I see the confusion here. No, no, Alex thought I was singling her out. No. I meant that all women are slaves to their biological urges, you know? Even you. You\u2019re a slave.\nHR Woman: I\u2019m a what?\nSheldon: Well, y-you, I-I\u2019m just saying, you know, at a certain point in a woman\u2019s menstrual cycle\u2026\nHR Woman: Whuh-ah! Woah! You can\u2019t talk about that, either, Dr. Cooper. Your language is entirely inappropriate, and I\u2019m gonna advise that you shut your mouth right now.\nSheldon: I don\u2019t see why I\u2019m the one being persecuted here. Dr. Hofstadter, he was bragging about his sexual desirability to anyone who would listen. You know, and Howard Wolowitz, he spent two years using university resources building a six-breasted sex robot. Oh, and at the office Christmas party, I heard Rajesh Koothrappali refer to you several times as Brown Sugar.\nHR Woman (writing): Hofstadter\u2026 Wolowitz\u2026 and the last one was Rajesh Koothrappali?\nSheldon: Yes. No, yeah, but in his defense, that wasn\u2019t racist. He\u2019s also brown.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment. Penny answers the door. Leonard is playing his cello outside.\nLeonard (singing): I\u2019m sorry Alex hit on me, hit on me, hit on me. I\u2019m sorry Alex hit on me, I\u2019d no idea I\u2019m cute.\nPenny: Oh, damn it, you are.\nLeonard: Please forgive me. I should have told you about Alex.\nPenny: I don\u2019t care about Alex. Fine, I care. Okay, I hate that bitch. But what really hurt is that you liked it so much. I mean, do I need to be worried?\nLeonard: Of course not. No. Why?\nPenny: Because, she is pretty and smart, and when you talk about work, she doesn\u2019t have to go home and look up words in the dictionary to understand what you said.\nLeonard: You do that?\nPenny: No.\nLeonard: Hang on. Are you feeling insecure? Because that\u2019s my thing, and if you take it away, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m bringing to this relationship.\nPenny: Yes, Leonard, I am insecure. Happy?\nLeonard: No, I\u2019m not happy.\nPenny: Why are you smiling?\nLeonard: I\u2019m sorry. I just never think of you having feelings like that.\nPenny: Well, I do.\nLeonard: Why? Nothing is ever going to happen between me and Alex.\nPenny: Good.\nLeonard: Come here. Tell you a secret?\nPenny: What\u2019s that?\nLeonard: With all these women chasing me, I kind of do feel like Captain Kirk.\nPenny: Can I tell you a secret?\nLeonard: Sure.\nPenny: Keep talking about Captain Kirk, and we\u2019re all gonna stop.\nLeonard: Message received. Ah, excuse me. (Answering phone) Hello. This is Dr. Hofstadter. Okay. All right, thank you. That\u2019s weird. I\u2019m getting called in to Human Resources.\nPenny: What did you do?\nLeonard: I don\u2019t know.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s kitchen.\nHoward: Huh. I just got called in to Human Resources.\nBernadette: Why?\nHoward: I don\u2019t know.\nScene: Raj\u2019s apartment.\nRaj: Huh. That is so strange. Human Resources wants to talk to me tomorrow. (To his dog) Could you stop licking your ass for two minutes? I have a problem here.\nScene: Human Resources department.\nHoward: Do you really think you should be drinking right now?\nRaj: How else am I supposed to talk to the Human Resources lady?\nHoward: I don\u2019t know. Seek professional help?\nRaj: I did. The guy at the liquor store said this stuff tastes great in coffee.\nHoward: Wait, you got called in, too? What is going on?\nLeonard: Sheldon threw us all under the bus.\nHoward: Oh.\nRaj: I feel like I\u2019ve been called down to the principal\u2019s office. Although I wouldn\u2019t mind if Brown Sugar suspended me. From a sex swing. This may have been a mistake.\nHoward: Relax. Everything\u2019s gonna be fine. Before I met Bernadette I was in here every other day. Uh, little tip, turn off your I Like Big Butts ringtone before you go in.\nRaj: Well, this is all your fault.\nLeonard: How is this my fault?\nRaj: If you weren\u2019t screwing around with Sheldon\u2019s assistant, none of this would be happening.\nLeonard: I wasn\u2019t screwing around with anyone.\nRaj: Oh, of course not. She was just sniffing around your goods because she was hunting for truffles.\nHR Woman: Ah, Mr. Wolowitz, it\u2019s been a while.\nHoward: Hey, Janine. How are Tom and the kids?\nJanine: Fine. You must be Dr. Hofstadter.\nLeonard: Yes, but I think this is all a big misunderstanding.\nRaj: Yeah, yeah, me, too. I didn\u2019t do anything.\nJanine: Is that alcohol on your breath?\nRaj: Howard built a sex robot.\nHoward: That is not true. All I did was build a robot.\nJanine: Did it have six breasts?\nHoward: I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m a feminist, I don\u2019t notice things like how many breasts a robot has.\nSheldon: Well, hello.\nLeonard: What are you doing here?\nSheldon: Actually, I came to speak to Mrs. Davis.\nJanine: And I\u2019m a little busy right now.\nSheldon: But I came to file a complaint. Somebody has made me feel uncomfortable in the workplace by using language of an inappropriate and sexual nature.\nJanine: And who was that?\nSheldon: You, you dirty birdie. I-I thought about the things you said to me yesterday, and I realized I\u2019m deeply offended. Now, be a dear and get me one of those complaint forms.\nJanine: That\u2019s it. All of you, in my office now!\nSheldon: And thanks to you, I know better than to ask if you\u2019re menstruating. And based on your behaviour, I don\u2019t have to.\nScene: Sheldon\u2019s office.\nSheldon: It has been pointed out to me that some of the things I said to you could be construed as offensive, and I would like to offer you my sincerest apology.\nAlex: Thank you, Dr. Cooper.\nSheldon: Yeah, additionally, you should know that the university has mandated that I take an online sexual harassment seminar so this sort of thing doesn\u2019t happen in the future.\nAlex: Okay.\nSheldon: Yeah. Now, unfortunately, uh, my time is much too valuable to waste on nonsense like this, so, um, I\u2019m gonna need you to take it for me. Oh, and, uh, you\u2019d better ace it, they\u2019re pretty mad.\nScene: The apartment.\nPenny: So, hey, I was thinking about that stuff with Alex.\nLeonard: Oh, would you stop worrying about that?\nPenny: I can\u2019t help it. But, look, I figured I could sit around and feel insecure, or I could do something about it. So I got a course catalogue at school and looked at some of the science classes.\nLeonard: That\u2019s great.\nPenny: No, it isn\u2019t, they are extremely boring. I mean, how do you not kill yourself, like, every day? Anyway, I decided I don\u2019t need to be a scientist, I could just look like one. So I bought these.\nLeonard: Glasses? I really don\u2019t think that\u2019s gonna change\u2026 oh, my God, you look so smart and hot.\nPenny: I know, right? Watch this. Molecules.\nLeonard: Okay, come with me.\nPenny: Where are we going?\nLeonard: To my bedroom, so I can take everything off but those glasses. And maybe the boots.\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "6_6": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: A dance video game where the characters are imperial stormtroopers from Star Wars and Bobba Fett.

(Switches game off)\nRaj: Dude! I was about to Bollywood this bitch.\nSheldon: Earlier today, I invited Professor Stephen Hawking to join me in the popular online game Words with Friends. Moments ago, he accepted my request. Do you understand what that means?\nHoward: That somewhere right now Stephen Hawking is saying, damn it, I meant to click no.\u201d\nSheldon: I\u2019ll walk you through it. The game is not called Words with Strangers. No, it\u2019s not even called Words with Acquaintances. It is called Words with\u2026\nRaj: I\u2019m not finishing your sentence. You pulled the plug on my funk.\nSheldon: Friends! It\u2019s Words with Friends! Which Stephen Hawking and I officially are. Now all I need is a bunk bed with a slide, I\u2019ll have everything I\u2019ve ever wanted since I was six years old.\nLeonard: That\u2019s really nice, Sheldon, I\u2019m happy for you.\nSheldon: And I\u2019m happy for you, too. You are now friends with someone who is officially friends with Stephen Hawking. Enjoy it, boys. You may have peaked.\nHoward: Sheldon, I know Stephen Hawking. I worked with him.\nSheldon: And if they ever come out with a game called Words with People You Once Worked With, you\u2019ll be off to the races.\nLeonard: Sheldon, I don\u2019t think this actually means\u2026\nSheldon: Hold that thought! Professor Hawking has made a move. Boy, oh, boy. Oh, it\u2019s only a matter of time before we\u2019re coming up with fun nicknames for each other. I\u2019ll be Coop. He\u2019ll be Wheels. If he\u2019s okay with that. (Leaves)\nRaj (putting game back on and removing shirt): All right. Crank up the AC, boys, it\u2019s gonna get hot in here!\nCredits sequence.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment.\nBernadette: So, I was taking a shower this morning, and when I got out, I started to dry off with what I thought was a towel but turned out to be Howard\u2019s mom\u2019s underwear. I had to take another shower. It wasn\u2019t enough. Nothing will ever be enough.\nAmy: I once looked in Sheldon\u2019s underwear drawer. He yelled at me. But now I know what it looks like and he can never take that away.\nBernadette: There\u2019s a book under here.\nPenny: Oh, I\u2019ll get that.\nBernadette: I got it.\nPenny: No, no, it\u2019s\u2026\nBernadette: I got it. Why do you have a history textbook?\nPenny: No, it\u2019s not a big deal. Just taking a class at the Pasadena Community College.\nBernadette: That\u2019s great. I didn\u2019t know you wanted to go back to school.\nPenny: It\u2019s just one history class. Look, I didn\u2019t finish college, so I thought I would give it a try.\nAmy: Not to mention, your acting career is going south like Sherman. Read about it in your book.\nBernadette: Why would you be embarrassed to tell us?\nPenny: No, I\u2019m not embarrassed. I just didn\u2019t want anyone to know because I haven\u2019t told Leonard yet.\nAmy: Why wouldn\u2019t you tell Leonard?\nPenny: Because it\u2019s me going back to school, and he\u2019s gonna be all \u201cyou can do it,\u201d and \u201chow can I help?\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m so proud of you.\u201d Ugh!\nBernadette: I just can\u2019t believe you could keep something like that from him.\nAmy: You guys have got to be the weirdest couple I know.\nPenny: Really? You can\u2019t think of anyone weirder?\nAmy: I can, but she\u2019s sitting right there.\nScene: Amy\u2019s laboratory.\nSheldon: Yes. I play the word quiver with a triple letter and a double word score for 72 points. That ought to let the air out of your tyres, Hawking.\nAmy: Wow, my boyfriend is friends with Stephen Hawking and my new dandruff shampoo doesn\u2019t smell like tar. Everything really is coming up Amy.\nSheldon: It is glorious. One of the greatest intellects of our time has agreed to engage with me in a gentlemanly battle of wits. And I\u2019m spanking him so hard his grad students won\u2019t be able to sit down.\nAmy: You know, when one male dominates another, his testosterone level rises.\nSheldon: What\u2019s your point?\nAmy: It\u2019s exciting to think you might be getting a testosterone level.\nSheldon: Ooh, my friend Stephen just played the word act for 18 points. That\u2019s right, I call him Stephen now, because I checked, and he was not okay with Wheels.\nAmy: Oh, you could turn his act into extract (pronounced with emphasis on act), and it would be for double points.\nSheldon: Amy. Why would you give me a word? Now, if I play extract it would be cheating.\nAmy: Sorry.\nSheldon: Although, I could play the completely unrelated and better word extract (pronounced with emphasis on ex). Ethical conundrum avoided. Thanks, brain.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment.\nPenny: Spaghetti okay?\nLeonard: It\u2019s crunchy. Just the way I like it.\nPenny: Yeah, I don\u2019t think the water was really boiling.\nLeonard: It\u2019s great. I love it.\nPenny: Okay, listen, there\u2019s something I need to tell you. I\u2019ve been thinking about going back to school for a while now. So a couple months ago, I started taking a history class at the community college.\nLeonard: Oh. That\u2019s great. Great, great, great. Why wait so long to tell me?\nPenny: I don\u2019t want you to make a big deal out of it.\nLeonard: Why do you think I\u2019d be like that? I get it, you\u2019re taking one class. It\u2019s nice. Maybe if it goes well, you take another, you enrol full-time. Ooh, be sure to keep an eye on which credits transfer to a four-year college.\nPenny: You\u2019re making it a big deal.\nLeonard: Sorry. Whatever. It\u2019s all good.\nPenny: Anyway, that\u2019s it. I just thought you should know.\nLeonard: Am I allowed to ask how the class is going?\nPenny: It\u2019s really good. We\u2019ve been talking about the origins of slavery. Turn in my first paper tomorrow.\nLeonard: Great topic. I can help with that. There are lots of different perspectives you can take, economic, sociological, political.\nPenny: Hey hey hey, this is my paper. And my perspective is that slavery is bad. Oh, and my professor\u2019s black, so I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s the right answer.\nLeonard: Can I take a look?\nPenny: No, Leonard, this is my thing.\nLeonard: Okay, I get it.\nPenny: Thank you.\nLeonard: It\u2019s like when I started doing chin-ups, I didn\u2019t want you to see until I could do one. FYI, really close.\nPenny: Thank you. Now behave yourself and eat your dinner. Maybe later, if you\u2019re lucky, you get to sleep with a college girl.\nLeonard: Really? \u2018Cause I went to four years of college and five years of grad school, that never happened once.\nScene: The apartment.\nRaj: I think the next time I have to speak to a call centre in India, I\u2019m going to try using an American accent.\nHoward: Why?\nRaj: Because when I use my regular voice, I feel like I\u2019m making fun of them.\nHoward: That\u2019s ridiculous. Not to mention, your American accent is terrible.\nRaj: Dude, my accent is brilliant. (In American accent) Hey, my snow-white American friends, let\u2019s put some cow meat on the barbecue and eat it until we\u2019re all obese.\nHoward: This is what you sound like. I think I\u2019m talking in an American accent, but it really sounds like I\u2019m wearing a set of giant dentures.\nRaj: Sheldon, do I really sound like that?\nHoward: Tell him he sounds like that.\nRaj: Sheldon, you okay?\nSheldon: It\u2019s been three days. Why hasn\u2019t Stephen Hawking played a word?\nRaj: The guy\u2019s a genius. Maybe you weren\u2019t challenging enough for him.\nSheldon: Not challenging? I was humiliating the man. I was thinking of writing a book called A Brief History of the Time I Made Stephen Hawking Cry Like a Little Girl.\nHoward: There\u2019s the problem. You can\u2019t beat Hawking like that. He hates to lose. Everyone knows the guy\u2019s a big baby. I mean, forget the wheelchair, he should be in a stroller.\nSheldon: Really?\nHoward: One time when I was working with him, he said that Johnny Depp was in The Matrix. I told him he was wrong, but he kept insisting. So I looked it up online and showed him. Well, the next day, he had a pizza party, and everyone got invited but me. And then he was all, your invitation must have gotten lost in the matrix.\nSheldon: Good Lord, what have I done?\nRaj (in American accent): Good Lord, what have I done?\nHoward: Terrible.\nRaj: All right, hotshot, let\u2019s hear your Indian.\nHoward: I can\u2019t sit on that elephant, my ass is on fire from eating all this curry.\nRaj: Okay, yeah, that\u2019s pretty good.\nScene: Penny\u2019s bedroom. Leonard sneaks from the bed and opens Penny\u2019s computer. \nLeonard: Please be good. Please be good. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Okay. She writes like she cooks.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Play. Play. Play. Play. Play.\nLeonard: What are you doing?\nSheldon: Trying to use a Jedi mind trick to control Stephen Hawking. Play. Play. Ugh! He must be wearing a tinfoil hat or something.\nLeonard: I did a bad thing.\nSheldon: Does it affect me?\nLeonard: No.\nSheldon: Then suffer in silence. Play. Play. Play. (Knock knock knock) Stephen Hawking. (Knock knock knock) Stephen Hawking. (Knock knock knock) Stephen Hawking.\nLeonard: Penny started taking a class. She wrote a paper, she didn\u2019t want me to read it, I went behind her back and I read it anyway.\nSheldon: Stephen Hawking hates me.\nLeonard: I don\u2019t know what to do. I mean, the paper\u2019s terrible. But if I tell her, she\u2019ll know that I read it and she\u2019ll get really mad.\nSheldon: I was beating him so bad, he doesn\u2019t want to be friends anymore. Why does everyone love me except Stephen Hawking?\nLeonard: Is it possible we\u2019re having two different conversations?\nSheldon: How would I know? I\u2019m not listening to you.\nLeonard: Hang on. Okay, here\u2019s what we\u2019re gonna do. Chess clock. We each get five minutes to talk about our problems. We\u2019ll take turns. Each turn will consist of a statement and a helpful response from the friend. Begin.\nSheldon: I humiliated Stephen Hawking in a game of Words with Friends. He stopped playing, and now we\u2019re not friends anymore.\nLeonard: He\u2019s probably busy. You\u2019re worried about nothing. Give it a couple more days. I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll play, and you\u2019ll see that everything\u2019s fine. My turn. I can\u2019t let Penny hand in a bad paper, but how do I tell her it\u2019s bad without letting her know that I read it?\nSheldon: Hmm. Beats me. Now, I know Hawking\u2019s not busy because I can see he\u2019s playing other people right now.\nLeonard: Maybe since you\u2019re so good, he\u2019s taking his time to meet the challenge. I want Penny to enjoy school\u2026\nSheldon: Wolowitz told me he\u2019s a big baby. But I didn\u2019t know that, and I played extract for 82 points. It\u2019s all Amy\u2019s fault. She told me to play it. I have got to cut her loose.\nLeonard: Sheldon, I wasn\u2019t done talking. She hands in the paper tomorrow. I know I could help her. And she\u2019s my girlfriend. I, I should be allowed to help her. Why aren\u2019t I allowed to help her?\nSheldon: Yeah, I hear you, brother.\nLeonard: No. You need to give me some advice.\nSheldon: Fine. Women, huh?\nLeonard: No, specific to my situation.\nSheldon: Blonde women, huh?\nLeonard: Empathetic.\nSheldon: It sucks to be you.\nLeonard: I quit.\nSheldon: Leonard, wait. No. I listened to your dumb thing. Leonard, come back. Leonard, come back. Leonard, come back.\nLeonard: What?\nSheldon: Oh, of course, it only works on the weak-minded.\nScene: Penny\u2019s bedroom.\nLeonard: Good morning, sunshine.\nPenny: Leonard. It\u2019s eight a.m. It\u2019s like the middle of the night.\nLeonard: I know, but I have to go to work, and I made you breakfast.\nPenny: Oh, wow, that\u2019s so sweet. Hey, what\u2019s this?\nLeonard: Uh, before you open that, um, are you familiar with the story of The Shoemaker and the Elves?\nPenny: Elves? Come on, Leonard. It\u2019s too early for Lord of the Rings.\nLeonard: No, no. Listen, um, once upon a time, there was this shoemaker and when he went to bed at night, elves would sneak in and they would make all these amazing shoes for him. And when the shoemaker woke up in the morning, he, he would be super happy, not mad at the elves at all. Open it.\nPenny: Okay. An examination of the economic, cultural, and political roots of slavery in the Old South, 1619 to 1865. What the hell is this?\nLeonard: Don\u2019t ask me. A little elf did it.\nPenny: So let me get this straight. You just assumed my paper would be bad so you wrote one for me?\nLeonard: No, I assumed it would be good. Then I read it.\nPenny: What?\nLeonard: No, I, I mean, it was good. There were just a few things that needed a little polishing.\nPenny: You changed every word.\nLeonard: That\u2019s not true. Uh, slavery. 1619. Your name at the top. That\u2019s all you.\nPenny: You are such an ass. This is exactly why I didn\u2019t want to tell you I was taking a class in the first place.\nLeonard: Please don\u2019t be upset. I just, I didn\u2019t want you ending up with a bad grade and get discouraged and give up on the idea of going back to school.\nPenny: Right, because me being in school is so important to you. That way, you wouldn\u2019t have to be dating someone who\u2019s only a waitress.\nLeonard: Oh, come on, you know that\u2019s not true.\nPenny: Do I? Listen to me. I need to do this on my own. If I fail, I fail. If I pass, I pass. Do you get it?\nLeonard: I\u2019m sorry. I was just trying to help.\nPenny: Yeah, well, next time don\u2019t. Oh, and since you like stories so much, this is not The Shoemaker\nand the Elves, okay? This is, Give a man a fish, he eats it. Teach a man to fish, he, sells it or something. Whatever, I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s just a lot better than what you did, you big jerk!\nScene: The cafeteria.\nHoward: You ever hear back from Hawking?\nSheldon: No. It would appear as if I\u2019ve lost him. Stupid brain.\nRaj: It\u2019ll be okay.\nSheldon: How can it be okay? Stephen Hawking\u2019s a genius and he talks like a robot. It\u2019s everything I\u2019ve ever wanted in a friend.\nRaj: Yeah, but if he\u2019s a sore loser, maybe you\u2019re better off without him.\nSheldon: You\u2019re right. I guess I just have to make lemonade out of the two of you. He played! He played! Coop and Rolling Thunder are together again. He was okay with that nickname.\nHoward: So, now all you have to do is let him win.\nSheldon: Yeah, way ahead of you. I will play the word at for two measly points, throwing the game and thus securing my friendship with the smartest man in the world.\nHoward: What are you waiting for? Hit send.\nSheldon: I can\u2019t. Losing on purpose is intellectually dishonest.\nRaj: So don\u2019t do it.\nSheldon: Oh, but I want to be Hawking\u2019s friend.\nHoward: So do it.\nSheldon: Oh, but if I do, I\u2019ll be a phony, a sellout, a Hollywood poser.\nRaj: Then don\u2019t do it.\nSheldon: I won\u2019t. This feels right. My mother always said, to thine own self be true.\nHoward: Good for you.\nSheldon: \u2018Course she also told me that every animal in the world got on one boat, so what does she know? And send.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: Oh, hey. Haven\u2019t heard from you in a couple days. You still mad at me?\nPenny: Nope. I have no reason to\u2026 \u201cB\u201d mad at you. Minus.\nLeonard: Wow.\nPenny: That\u2019s right. On my paper. Not yours, mine, you punk-ass elf.\nLeonard: I don\u2019t know what to say.\nPenny: Hmm, how about, gee, Penny, you\u2019re smarter than I thought. You may be the one in school, but I\u2019m the one who learned a lesson. I\u2019m so stupid, Penny. Duh.\nSheldon: She sounds exactly like you.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment.\nAmy: How\u2019d it go with Leonard?\nPenny: I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll be making that mistake again.\nBernadette: Good.\nPenny: So, I know this goes without saying, but if either of you tell Leonard you helped me rewrite this paper, I will beat you both with a bag of oranges.\nAmy: Understood.\nBernadette: Got it.\nPenny: Now, ladies, we got a B-minus on this paper. I think if we put our heads together, on the next one we could get an A.\nBernadette: Uh, but we got you a B-minus on purpose to make it believable.\nPenny: Believable? You saying I\u2019m not smart?\nBernadette: No, no!\nAmy: You\u2019re smart.\nPenny: That\u2019s better.\nAmy: I feel like I\u2019m in high school again.\nBernadette: Yeah, doing the prom queen\u2019s homework so she\u2019ll like us.\nAmy: I know. It\u2019s finally working.\nScene: The apartment. Sheldon\u2019s phone rings.\nSheldon: It\u2019s Stephen Hawking.\nLeonard: Well answer it. I want to hear.\nSheldon: Professor Hawking, how nice of you to call.\nStephen Hawking: Hello. I really enjoyed our game, Dr. Cooper.\nSheldon: Oh, me, too.\nStephen Hawking: Or should I say Dr. Loser? Ha, ha, ha.\nSheldon: Yes, congratulations. You won fair and square. Uh, very impressive, sir.\nStephen Hawking: Do you like brain teasers?\nSheldon: Oh, I love brain teasers.\nStephen Hawking: What does Sheldon Cooper and a black hole have in common? They both suck.

The university won\u2019t let me switch my field of study to inflationary cosmology. They\u2019re forcing me to continue with string theory.\nHoward: Why?\nSheldon: He said it\u2019s why they hired me, it\u2019s, it\u2019s what my grant was designated for, and that everybody has to do things they don\u2019t want to do. He then gave an example of something he had to do, even though he didn\u2019t want to, which was look at my stupid face.\nLeonard: That\u2019s a rude thing to say, out loud.\nSheldon: It\u2019s an outrage. Honestly, I\u2019m tempted to leave the university.\nHoward: You know, if you\u2019re really serious about that, I hear there are some exciting opportunities in home care for the old and fat.\nLeonard: Whatever you do, just don\u2019t make any rash decisions.\nSheldon: I don\u2019t know.

I have some exciting news.\nMrs Hofstadter: I\u2019m listening.\nLeonard: Before I tell you, will you promise to try and be happy for me and keep any concerns you have to yourself?\nMrs Hofstadter: No. Let me save you all of your hemming and hawing. Sheldon already told me that you and Penny are engaged.\nLeonard: I hate that you talk to him more than you talk to me.\nMrs Hofstadter: Would you like for you and me to talk more?\nLeonard: You know what? It\u2019s probably fine.\nMrs Hofstadter: In any event, while I\u2019ve had my misgivings about Penny, Sheldon spoke very fondly of her, and if she is good enough for him, then she\u2019s good enough for me.\nLeonard: I\u2019m your son.

I\u2019m desperate.\nPenny: No.\nBernadette: I\u2019ll pay you anything you want.\nPenny: Okay, then, yeah.\nScene: Mrs Wolowitz\u2019s house.\nPenny: No, keep your money.\nBernadette: I could\u2019ve ridden a bull longer than that.\nScene: The apartment. \nLeonard: What you working on?\nSheldon: I\u2019m writing an appeal to the Faculty Senate, so that I can move on from string theory.\nLeonard: Oh. How\u2019s it going?\nSheldon: You tell me. Dear Esteemed Colleagues, as you may know, I have requested to change my field of study. My decision to do so is, I believe, in the best interest of science. At your convenience, I\u2019d be happy to explain it to you in words you\u2019ll understand.\nLeonard: It\u2019s nice that you called them esteemed.\nSheldon: You\u2019re right. I\u2019ll take that out.\nLeonard: So, listen, there was something I was hoping to float past you.\nSheldon: Mm.\nLeonard: Now that Penny and I are engaged, I thought we might want to talk about our living arrangements.\nSheldon: Of course. She\u2019s spent many nights here, and you\u2019re worried about preserving the myth of her virginity before the wedding.\nLeonard: I\u2019m not.\nSheldon: Good, because not only has that ship sailed, if it hit an iceberg, countless men would perish.\nLeonard: Actually, this is about where she and I are going to live.\nSheldon: What do you mean?\nLeonard: Well, well, we might want to live together.\nSheldon: Oh, yeah, well, I\u2019ve already given this some thought, and I\u2019m willing to let Penny live with us one day a week for a trial period. Now, obviously, not when she\u2019s made cranky by the shedding of her uterine lining.\nLeonard: That\u2019s very sweet. But we were thinking more of us maybe living together with\u2026 not you.\nSheldon: I don\u2019t understand. How could we all live together if I\u2019m not there?\nLeonard: Look, I, I know this is, this is change, and that sounds scary.\nSheldon: Where are you going to go?\nLeonard: I don\u2019t know. We just started to think about this. Maybe I\u2019ll move in with Penny, or maybe she and I\u2019ll take this place, and you can move across the hall.\nSheldon: Move across the hall? Did you take a marijuana?\nLeonard: No, I did not.\nSheldon: Did you get hit on the head with a coconut?\nLeonard: No.\nSheldon: Well, then, I\u2019m all out of guesses. What? Me move across the hall. Why would you even suggest such a thing?\nLeonard: Because I love Penny, and want to give her the life she deserves.\nSheldon: I see. You\u2019re putting your future bride\u2019s happiness above mine.\nLeonard: Well, yeah.\nSheldon: Wow.\nScene: Amy\u2019s apartment. \nSheldon: How dare the university force me to go back to string theory?\nAmy: They just don\u2019t appreciate you.\nSheldon: Yeah, and on top of that, Leonard has the audacity to suggest that now that he and Penny are engaged, he may not want to live with me any more.\nAmy: Here, I made you some Strawberry Quik.\nSheldon: I have real problems here, Amy. I can\u2019t be mollified with a beverage designed for children. Mmm, yummy.\nAmy: You know, this might work out for the best. I mean, you\u2019re always complaining about what a terrible roommate Leonard is. Like how he turns up the thermostat when you\u2019re not there.\nSheldon: Ugh, it\u2019s like walking into the Amazon. And not the good Amazon with one-day shipping. The awful one with birds and snakes.\nAmy: You hate the sound of all those keys on his key chain.\nSheldon: Four keys! Who does he think he is, a warden?\nAmy: See? Maybe you\u2019ll love living alone.\nSheldon: I don\u2019t know. Perhaps.\nAmy: And if it turns out you don\u2019t, you and I could live together.\nSheldon: You and\u2026 oh, sure, and while we\u2019re at it, why don\u2019t we get engaged, too? Why don\u2019t we get a little house, start a family? Enjoy our sunset years together? Do you hear yourself, woman?\nAmy: Sheldon, it was just a thought.\nSheldon: No. Here\u2019s a thought. You\u2019re not moving in, Leonard\u2019s not moving out, everything stays exactly the way it is. And by the way, I saw you make this Strawberry Quik with syrup, you\u2019re supposed to use the powder.\nAmy: It tastes the same.\nSheldon: No. The syrup tastes better and I don\u2019t like it.\nScene: The apartment. \nPenny: This is so sweet. You never cook for me.\nLeonard: Well, you cook for me all the time and, ugh.\nPenny: If you don\u2019t like my cooking, why haven\u2019t you ever said anything?\nLeonard: It\u2019s hard to talk with so much heavy chewing to do.\nPenny: Sorry. I\u2019ll get better.\nLeonard: I know you\u2019ll try. So, should we talk about setting a date?\nPenny: Well, I\u2019d like to pick one that works with my brother\u2019s schedule.\nLeonard: Okay. And when would that be?\nPenny: Uh, 12 to 18 months from now, depending on good behaviour.\nAmy: Hi, is Sheldon here?\nLeonard: No, I thought he was with you.\nAmy: He was, but he stormed off and now he isn\u2019t answering his phone.\nLeonard: What happened?\nAmy: He was really angry that you suggested he move out.\nLeonard: Oh.\nAmy: I also mentioned that he and I could live together but he was too mad at you to realize what a great idea that is.\nLeonard: Well, he\u2019s been having a couple of tough days. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s fine. He probably just needs a little alone time to decompress.\nAmy: You\u2019re probably right. So, what are you guys doing?\nPenny: Well, Leonard cooked for me and now we\u2019re just having a nice dinner, you know, as a newly engaged couple.\nAmy: That\u2019s nice.\nLeonard: Anyway, as I was saying, Sheldon probably just needs a little alone time. \u2018Cause that\u2019s important. Not just for him, but for most anybody, really.\nAmy: Don\u2019t I know it. What is that, polenta?\nPenny: Amy, get out.\nAmy: Right.\nScene: The comic book store.\nSheldon: No.\nStuart: Hey, Sheldon.\nSheldon: What happened?\nStuart: I was cooking in the back room last night and the hot plate caught on fire.\nSheldon: And you couldn\u2019t put it out?\nStuart: I was across the street at the do-it-yourself car wash, taking a shower.\nSheldon: So when will you reopen?\nStuart: Um, I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m waiting to hear back from the insurance company.\nSheldon: So, tomorrow?\nStuart: I don\u2019t mean to be rude, Sheldon, but, uh, my life is kind of falling apart right now.\nSheldon: Your life? The university is making me do string theory and my girlfriend loves me so much she wants to live with me. And now, the place I need to go when I\u2019m sad is damp and smells funny.\nStuart: Well, sorry I let you down.\nSheldon: No. I do not accept this. Everything is changing and I hate it. It stops now. I\u2019m helping you get back on your feet. I would like to purchase this comic book, please.\nStuart: That\u2019ll be $2.99.\nSheldon: Really? It\u2019s soaking wet.\nStuart: Fine, a dollar.\nSheldon: Can you break a twenty?\nStuart: No, I only have hundreds.\nSheldon: You know what? I don\u2019t always recognize sarcasm, but I do right now, and I don\u2019t appreciate it. I\u2019m sorry for your loss. But you\u2019re not the only one whose day has been a disaster.\nStuart: (Light falls on ground just where he was standing a moment before) That could have killed me. I can\u2019t catch a break.\nScene: The apartment. \nLeonard: I haven\u2019t heard from Sheldon in a while. You think he\u2019s okay?\nPenny: Oh, I\u2019m sure he\u2019s fine.\nLeonard: I\u2019m gonna see where he is.\nPenny: How?\nLeonard: Oh, I know his password, so I can track his phone.\nPenny: You do that?\nLeonard: Not always, but ever since he wandered off at the swap meet chasing a balloon, I get worried.\nPenny: He can take care of himself. Look, we went over stranger danger and gave him that whistle.\nLeonard: That\u2019s weird.\nPenny: What?\nLeonard: He\u2019s at the train station.\nPenny: So? He loves trains.\nLeonard: It\u2019s dark out and he\u2019s alone, I don\u2019t like it. Let\u2019s go get him.\nPenny: It\u2019s sweet how you look out for him. You\u2019re a good guy.\nLeonard: It\u2019s not just that. My mother would kill me if I let something happen to him.\nScene: The comic book store.\nRaj: Dude, I\u2019m so sorry.\nHoward: Don\u2019t take this the wrong way, but did you do this for the insurance money?\nStuart: No. God, you sound like the police, the firemen, my parents, my therapist and the insurance company.\nRaj: We\u2019re here for you, man. Whatever you need, okay?\nStuart: Uh, actually, I was wondering if I could crash at your place for a few nights.\nRaj: Sure, of course. Oh, actually, Emily was gonna spend the night.\nStuart: You slept with her? Nice.\nRaj: Well, I can\u2019t take all the credit. She let me do it to her, but, uh, but I can always call her and cancel.\nHoward: Hang on. I know a place you can stay and earn some money at the same time.\nStuart: Great.\nHoward: I just have to warn you, it\u2019ll involve humiliation, degradation and verbal abuse.\nStuart: So what\u2019s the catch?\nScene: The train station.\nLeonard: Sheldon.\nSheldon: You tracked my phone?\nLeonard: Yeah.\nSheldon: Boy, you chase one balloon for three miles.\nPenny: We were worried about you.\nSheldon: Don\u2019t be melodramatic. I\u2019m just getting on a train and leaving forever.\nLeonard: Seriously? You don\u2019t even have a change of clothes or a toothbrush.\nSheldon: My plan is to stop at malls and buy what I need. It\u2019s called living off the land.\nLeonard: Okay, I know you\u2019re upset and there\u2019s a lot of stuff going on, but it\u2019s nothing we can\u2019t work out. Come on, let\u2019s get you home.\nSheldon: No. I\u2019ve reached my breaking point. I need to leave. Now.\nPenny: And go where?\nSheldon: It doesn\u2019t matter.\nLeonard: So a few things don\u2019t go your way and your best decision is to ride the rails like a hobo?\nSheldon: I suppose it is. Except I have a credit card. And I refuse to carry my laptop at the end of a stick. And I\u2019d sooner die than eat beans out of a can.\nLeonard: Come on, come home with us and tomorrow I\u2019ll, I\u2019ll take you to Legoland.\nSheldon: Legoland is not the solution to everything. And it\u2019s too much of a scene since that movie came out.\nLeonard: Then what can I do?\nSheldon: Leonard, I am overwhelmed. Everything is changing and it\u2019s simply too much. I need to get away and think.\nLeonard: Oh, come on, you know you\u2019re overreacting.\nPenny: Leonard, hang on. Just come here. Maybe we need to let him go.\nLeonard: What? Why?\nPenny: It might be good for him.\nLeonard: You know he can\u2019t take a trip like this by himself.\nPenny: He\u2019s a grown man.\nLeonard: No, he looks like a grown man. You\u2019ve seen Freaky Friday, sometimes little kids end up in big person bodies.\nPenny: Leonard, we can\u2019t protect him forever.\nLeonard: I know, but\u2026\nPenny: He\u2019ll be okay. You taught him well, Padawan.\nSheldon: Good Lord. Padawan\u2019s the student, not the teacher.\nPenny: Seriously, let him go.\nLeonard: Sheldon, if you really need to do this, I\u2019m not gonna stand in your way.\nSheldon: I do.\nLeonard: Okay. Good luck.\nPenny: Be safe and call us.\nSheldon: I will.\nLeonard: Bye, buddy. Sheldon?\nSheldon: Yes?\nLeonard: I\u2019m gonna miss you.\nSheldon: Of course you are.\nLeonard: He just made that easier.\nPenny: Mm.\nScene: Mrs Wolowitz\u2019s house.\nStuart: Hey. What are you guys still doing here? I got this, go. Go home.\nHoward: You sure?\nStuart: Yeah, she\u2019s fed, she took her pills, she\u2019s all tucked in and watching TV.\nBernadette: So, she\u2019s not too much for you?\nStuart: Are you kidding? I love her, she\u2019s great.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Stewie, you gonna watch Wheel of Fortune with me?\nStuart: Coming, Debbie.\nHoward: You call her Debbie?\nStuart: She insisted. So, hey, guys, thank you so much. This job is a dream come true.\nHoward: Was that a little weird?\nBernadette: Yeah. I don\u2019t know why, but something about it feels unnatural.\nHoward: Okay, let\u2019s go.\nBernadette: Yep.\nScene: The apartment.\nAmy (on phone): Okay, Sheldon, thanks for checking in. Talk to you tomorrow? Oh, okay, bye.\nLeonard: He\u2019s okay?\nAmy: Actually sounds like he\u2019s doing pretty well.\nPenny: I really think this is gonna be for the best.\nLeonard: Me, too. And he was able to take a sabbatical from\u2026\nAmy: How could you let him go?\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "4_24": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The Cheesecake Factory\nPenny: Hey, you guys ready to order?\nHoward: Uh..\nLeonard: Sure\nPenny: Okay, Priya?\nPriya: Uh, I\u2019ll have the Shepherd\u2019s Pie. You want to split that with me?\nLeonard: Oh, no, no, no, he doesn\u2019t.\nPriya: Why not?\nLeonard: Well, you have milk in the taters, milk in the gravy, parmesan crust. Your lactose-intolerant boyfriend will turn into a gas-filled Macy\u2019s Day balloon.\nSheldon: Not quite accurate. The Macy\u2019s balloons are filled with helium, whereas Leonard produces copious amounts of methane.\nLeonard: So, no, on the Shepherd\u2019s Pie. Can we move on?\nPenny: Yeah, a little tip: he says he can eat frozen yoghurt. Do not believe it.\nLeonard: Sea bass. I\u2019ll have the sea bass.\nHoward: You gotta like this, the girlfriend and the ex-girlfriend bonding over your rooty-tooty stinky booty.\nLeonard: Kill me.\nSheldon: It wouldn\u2019help. The human body is capable of being flatulent for hours after death.\nBernadette: Guys, sorry I\u2019m late. I have amazing news.\nSheldon: Bernadette, before you change the subject, does anyone have any final comments on Leonard\u2019s faulty digestive system?\nLeonard: So, what\u2019s your news, Bernadette?\nBernadette: The thesis committee accepted my doctoral dissertation. I\u2019m getting my PhD.\nPenny: Oh!\nSheldon: Oh, congratulations.\nPenny: Wow, so that means you\u2019re a doctor, you\u2019re a doctor, you\u2019re a doctor, you\u2019re a doctor, and Howard, you know a lot of doctors.\nHoward: Congratulations, honey.\nBernadette: Thank you.\nLeonard: So, Howard, tell us, how\u2019s it feel knowing that when you two get married, you\u2019ll be referred to as Mr. and Dr. Wolowitz?\nSheldon: Unless he takes Bernadette\u2019s last name. And considering her advanced status, that could open some doors for him.\nHoward: Please, this isn\u2019t about me. I\u2019m proud of you.\nBernadette: Well, you\u2019ll be really be proud of this. I was headhunted by a big pharmaceutical company. They\u2019re gonna pay me a buttload of money!\nHoward: What?\nLeonard: Bernadette, that\u2019s great. Howard, do you make a buttload?\nHoward: Better than what you\u2019ve got a buttload of.\nLeonard: Hey, if I roll down the windows in the car, everything\u2019s peachy. If you do it, you\u2019re still not a doctor.\nPenny: Yeah, just a heads-up on the car window deal. It helps, but everything is not peachy.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: Raj\u2019s apartment. \nRaj (earphones in, singing): Oh, if there was a problem, you can\u2019t solve it, check out the hook while my DJ revolves it. Ice, Ice, baby. Ice, Ice, baby. (Removes headphones and goes to refrigerator).\nPriya (off): Oh, God, I feel ridiculous in this dress.\nLeonard (off): You look beautiful, Lieutenant Uhura. Now prepare for inspection.\nPriya (off): Shh, my brother\u2019s going to hear you.\nLeonard (off): Relax, he\u2019s got headphones on. And we\u2019re ten miles above Earth in a starship.\nRaj: Really, ten miles? You\u2019re orbiting inside the atmosphere? Moron.\nPriya (off): I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m wearing my brother\u2019s Halloween costume.\nLeonard (off): I can\u2019t believe you think he only wears it on Halloween. Open the landing bay doors, shuttle craft approaching.\nRaj: Okay, gotta go.\nScene: Howard\u2019s house.\nHoward: Hey, what\u2019s up?\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Is that my future daughter-in-law, the doctor?\nHoward: No, Ma! It\u2019s Raj!\nMrs Wolowitz (off): He\u2019s a doctor too, right?\nHoward: Yes!\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Like Leonard and the skinny weirdo!\nHoward: Sheldon, yes! Everybody\u2019s a doctor but me!\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Well, whose fault is that?\nHoward: What\u2019s up?\nRaj: Leonard\u2019s putting disgusting memories in my memory foam mattress. Can I stay here tonight?\nHoward: Sure, but I\u2019m going out with Bernadette. It\u2019ll just be you and my mother.\nRaj: I guess that\u2019s okay.\nHoward: Ma, can Rajesh sleep over?!\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Of course, he and I can play doctor!\nRaj: She\u2019s kidding, right?\nHoward: I don\u2019t know, she\u2019s pretty feisty since they put her on hormone-replacement therapy.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Paging Dr. Cutie Pie!\nScene: The apartment. Sheldon is talking to Amy on webcam. \nSheldon: I must say, Amy, I was very impressed to see that Bernadette got her PhD.\nAmy: It\u2019s indeed admirable. Although, it is microbiology.\nSheldon: Your doctorate is in neurobiology. I fail to see the distinction.\nAmy: I\u2019ll make it simple for you. I study the brain, the organ responsible for Beethoven\u2019s Fifth Symphony. Bernadette studies yeast, the organism responsible for Michelob Lite. Is there something wrong with your neck?\nSheldon: It\u2019s a little stiff. What a remarkably fragile structure to support such a valuable payload. Not unlike balancing a Faberge egg on a Pixie Stick.\nAmy: Have you considered massage?\nSheldon: I\u2019d like to respond to that sarcastically. Yes, I relish the thought of a stranger covering my body with oil and rubbing it.\nAmy: I was proposing you massage your muscles with your own hands.\nSheldon: Still sounds like a lot of unnecessary touching.\nAmy: Trust me. With your right hand, locate the spot where the scapula meets the acromion process.\nSheldon: All right.\nAmy: Now push your third finger along the ridge of the shoulder blade, making a small rotation as you do so.\nSheldon: Rotating.\nAmy: You should feel a small node-like object rolling back and forth along the bone.\nSheldon: You mean the myofascial point?\nAmy: Obviously. Now bear down on it like the seventh grade noogies we all know too well.\nSheldon: Oh, dear Lord, yes, yes, oh, yes! Amy, I\u2019ve never been touched like this before! Oh! Oh, my hands are magic!\nAmy: Don\u2019t flatter yourself. Your hands are blunt tools guided by my knowledge of the nervous system. I could just as easily have paralyzed you.\nSheldon: There\u2019s someone at my door.\nAmy: That doesn\u2019t interest me. Goodbye.\nRaj (at door): Can I sleep here tonight?\nSheldon: Why?\nRaj: Leonard\u2019s having astronomically inaccurate Star Trek sex with my sister.\nSheldon: I can see how that would be upsetting. Come in. I\u2019ll get the sheets and blankets for the couch.\nRaj: Oh, don\u2019t bother. I\u2019ll just sleep in Leonard\u2019s room.\nSheldon: No, I can\u2019t authorize that.\nRaj: Well, he\u2019s in my bed. Why can\u2019t I be in his?\nSheldon: The Hammurabic Code is an eye for an eye, not a bed for a bed.\nRaj: Come on, dude, I\u2019m exhausted, and Tyra Banks says the most important item in your makeup bag is a good night\u2019s sleep.\nSheldon: All right. This is a form indemnifying me from your use of Leonard\u2019s bedroom. Sign here, indicating that I tried to stop you and did so using a stern facial expression.\nRaj: Good night, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Wait. Not yet. We still have to go over safety procedures. Now, the apartment has three emergency exits located here, here, and here. In the event of a power outage, luminous paint will guide you to the nearest exit.\nRaj: You\u2019re kidding.\nSheldon: I never kid about safety.\nScene: Leonard\u2019s bedroom. Leonard enters, and accidentally sits on Raj. Both exclaim.\nLeonard: What are you doing here?\nRaj: I was sleeping.\nLeonard: In my bed?\nRaj: Well, I would\u2019ve slept in my own bed, but it was being used to bring shame to my family. And the memory of Gene Roddenberry.\nLeonard: Oh, you heard?\nRaj: Scotty, I need more power.\nLeonard: Sorry. Does Sheldon know you\u2019re sleeping in here?\nRaj: Are you kidding? He made me sign a waiver, participate in an emergency fire drill and take a refresher course in CPR. Thank God he had a dummy.\nLeonard: Oh, yeah. Mouth-to-Mouth Mona. You know, she used to date Howard?\nRaj: Oh, my God, she\u2019s that Mona? Why can\u2019t you and my sister spend your nights here?\nLeonard: We tried. She doesn\u2019t get along with Sheldon.\nRaj: Sheldon doesn\u2019t get along with Sheldon. It\u2019s still no reason for me to have to listen to you arm your photon torpedoes every night.\nLeonard: Okay, well, how about this. Until Priya gets her own place, you stay here and I\u2019ll stay at your apartment.\nRaj: Can I bring girls here?\nLeonard: You? Sure. Bring as many as you want.\nRaj: Okay, deal.\nLeonard: Just not against their will.\nScene: The cafeteria. \nLeonard: Do you really think you should be eating that cake?\nHoward: Why?\nLeonard: If you\u2019re gonna be a trophy husband for a rich wife, you might want to watch your waistline.\nRaj: He\u2019s right. A minute on the lips, a lifetime on the hips.\nHoward: Yeah, ha-ha. First of all, I\u2019m not threatened by my fianc\u00e9e\u2019s success. I\u2019m proud of her. And secondly, I have my own career.\nLeonard: Until you have kids.\nSheldon: Good news, Raj. I got the blood work back from the lab. You\u2019re okay to stay for a while.\nRaj: When did you take my blood?\nSheldon: Not important. Your sugar was a little high. I\u2019d follow up with your regular physician. In the meantime, I have some paperwork here for you to go over.\nRaj: What the hell is this?\nSheldon: Boilerplate stuff. A modified roommate agreement for a temporary house guest. And a living will and durable power of attorney.\nRaj: This says you can make end of life decisions for me.\nSheldon: As your friend, let\u2019s hope it doesn\u2019t come to that. Please sign.\nRaj: Did you sign this?\nLeonard: There\u2019s a reciprocity clause. You get to pull the plug on him, too.\nRaj: Well, that seems fair.\nSheldon: Congratulations and welcome temporarily aboard. Here\u2019s your I.D. Card, your key and your lapel pin. Which Leonard was too cool to wear. FYI, part of your responsibilities as roommate pro tem will be to drive me to and from work, the comic book store, the barbershop and the park for one hour every other Sunday for fresh air.\nLeonard: Bring a ball or a Frisbee, you know, something he can chase.\nSheldon: Also, you\u2019re tasked with bringing home all takeout dinners. Tonight is Thai food. You\u2019ll find the standard order in appendix B or downloadable from my FTP server. If you have any questions, here\u2019s the FAQ sheet, or if you prefer the human touch, I do a live web chat called Apartment Talk on Tuesday nights.\nLeonard: No backsies.\nScene: The apartment. \nRaj: Sheldon, dinner!\nSheldon: What is this?\nRaj: This is the difference between eating and dining.\nSheldon: Remarkable. I\u2019m just realizing how much Leonard\u2019s been skating by all these years.\nRaj: It\u2019s not a big thing. Just think of me as a brown Martha Stewart.\nPenny (at door): Hey, Sheldon, did you change your Wi-Fi password again?\nSheldon: Yes, it\u2019s \u201cPenny, get your own Wi-Fi.\u201d No spaces.\nPenny: Thanks. Wow! What\u2019s with the fancy spread?\nSheldon: My new roommate is bending over backwards to ingratiate himself to me. (Pointing to lapel badge) Uh, nice touch, by the way.\nPenny: What do you mean, new roommate? What happened to Leonard?\nSheldon: The same thing that happened to Homo Erectus. He was replaced by a superior species.\nRaj: I\u2019m the new Homo in town. That came out wrong.\nPenny: All right, let me try this again. Where\u2019s Leonard?\nRaj: He\u2019s living at my place, so I\u2019m living here.\nSheldon: You\u2019re living here provisionally. But I must say it\u2019s looking good.\nPenny: Woah, Leonard and Priya are living together? That\u2019s big.\nSheldon: No. Origami napkin swans, that\u2019s the headline.\nRaj: It\u2019s a good thing.\nScene: Bernadette\u2019s bedroom. \nHoward: So do you know what kind of research you\u2019ll be doing at this pharmaceutical company?\nBernadette: Well, there are a couple of opportunities available, but I volunteered for the premature ejaculation project. I mean, it\u2019s not like either one of us has heart disease. Oh, I almost forgot. I got you a little present.\nHoward: Oh, Bernie, no. You didn\u2019t have to.\nBernadette: I wanted to. Come on, open it.\nHoward: You bought me a Rolex? How much did this cost?\nBernadette: Oh, you let me worry about the money. I just want my baby to have pretty things.\nScene: The apartment.\nRaj: More wine?\nPenny: Oh, no, no, no. I\u2019ve had way too much already.\nSheldon: Here\u2019s an interesting fact about alcohol.\nPenny: Hit me.\nSheldon: Man is not the only species that ferments fruit in order to become intoxicated. Can you guess what the other is? Hint, sometimes they pack the alcohol in their trunks.\nPenny: Monkeys.\nSheldon: When does a monkey have a trunk?\nPenny: When a suitcase just won\u2019t do.\nSheldon: Mmm, all right. It would appear as if alcohol is playing keep-away with your intelligence. Good night. Please note, it is now past ten p.m. Per our roommate agreement, kindly refrain from raucous laughter, clinking of glasses, and celebratory gunfire.\nPenny: Okay, explain something to me. You watch Leonard put up with that guy for years and years. What has to break inside your brain for you to think, Oh, Krishna, I\u2019ve got to get me some of that?\nRaj: Well, it\u2019s a lot better than having to wear noise-cancelling headphones in my own apartment.\nPenny: What? Oh, God, yeah. Yeah. Leonard\u2019s a noisy little dude in the sack.\nRaj: Every night.\nPenny: Really? Even during allergy season, when he has to alternate between kissing and breathing?\nRaj: It\u2019s my sister. Can we not talk about this any more?\nPenny: Yeah. Sorry, sorry. Can I tell you a secret?\nRaj: Yeah.\nPenny: I screwed up. Leonard\u2019s a great guy. Never should have broken up with him.\nRaj: Well, uh, to paraphrase Shakespeare, It\u2019s better to have loved and lost than to stay home every night and download increasingly shameful pornography.\nPenny: Oh, you poor baby.\nRaj: What\u2019s wrong with me, Penny?\nPenny: Nothing, nothing. You know, if we weren\u2019t friends, and you hadn\u2019t brought up that creepy pornography story, I\u2019d be on you like the speed of light squared on matter to make energy.\nRaj: Hey, you totally got that right! E equals M C squared.\nPenny: I listen. I have no idea what it means, but I listen. To friendship.\nRaj: To friendship.\nSheldon (off): Would you booze hounds please stop that infernal clinking? And the answer was elephant!\nScene: Raj\u2019s apartment. Leonard and Priya are kissing. \nLeonard: Mmm. Mmm.\nPriya: Leonard, sweetheart, we\u2019re kissing, not eating hot soup.\nLeonard: Sorry.\nPriya (computer tone): That\u2019s my parents on video chat. Go hide in the bedroom.\nLeonard: Oh, come on! Why don\u2019t we just tell them that we\u2019re dating?\nPriya: Oh, we\u2019ve been through this. It\u2019s not the time.\nLeonard: When is the time?\nPriya: I\u2019ve got five brothers and sisters. One of them is bound to screw up real big, and then I\u2019ll tell my parents about you. Now, shoo.\nLeonard: Fine.\nPriya: Hello, Mummy. Hello, Daddy.\nDr Koothrappali: We heard there was a tornado in Kansas City. Is that close to you?\nPriya: No.\nMrs Koothrappali: Where is your brother?\nPriya: Out with friends.\nDr Koothrappali: I don\u2019t like it, a young girl alone in an apartment.\nMrs Koothrappali: I\u2019ll sleep so much better when you move back here next month.\nLeonard: You\u2019re moving back to India?\nDr Koothrappali: Who\u2019s that?\nMrs Koothrappali: Oh, my God! There\u2019s someone in your apartment. Call the police in America!\nLeonard: When were you going to tell me about this?\nPriya: Oh, hello, Leonard. What a pleasant surprise! Mummy, Daddy, you remember Rajesh\u2019s friend Leonard.\nDr Koothrappali: I thought you said Rajesh was out with his friends.\nPriya: He has many friends.\nDr Koothrappali: Rajesh has many friends?\nMrs Koothrappali: Why are you lying to us?\nLeonard: She\u2019s lying because she doesn\u2019t want you to know we\u2019re dating.\nPriya: Leonard!\nLeonard: Well, what difference does it make? If you\u2019re moving back to India, we\u2019re obviously breaking up.\nPriya: You know what? I don\u2019t want to deal with this right now.\nLeonard: So. Hot in India?\nDr Koothrappali: Of course it is. It always is. It\u2019s India. Now, what do you have to say for yourself?\nLeonard: Uh. That is a beautiful tapestry.\nScene: Leonard\u2019s bedroom. Raj and Penny are in bed. \nPenny (waking up): Oh, God. Oh, God! Oh. Okay, look. This never happened. Do you understand me? (Raj nods) Really? Still can\u2019t talk to me?\nScene: The living room. Leonard is asleep on the couch. \nSheldon: What are you doing here?\nLeonard: What?\nSheldon: I said, what are you doing here?\nLeonard: I live here.\nSheldon: I have paperwork that says differently.\nLeonard: Priya\u2019s going back to India.\nSheldon: Irrelevant. Rajesh and I have a good thing going and you\u2019re not going to ruin it. (Knock on door) What are you doing here?\nHoward: I\u2019ve been up all night. I had a fight with Bernadette.\nSheldon: Why?\nHoward: She gave me a beautiful watch.\nSheldon: Leonard, do you understand this?\nLeonard: Yes.\nSheldon: Talk to him.\nPenny (entering room dishevelled, with a half naked Raj behind): Damn.\nLeonard: What\u2019s going on?\nPenny: Oh. It\u2019s, it\u2019s not what it looks like.\nSheldon: What does it look like?\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "1_10": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The downstairs lobby.\nLeonard: See, the liquid metal Terminators were created in the future by Skynet, and Skynet was developed by Miles Dyson, but that future no longer exists, due to Dyson\u2019s death in Terminator 2.\nSheldon: Okay, then riddle me this. Assuming all the good Terminators were originally evil Terminators created by Skynet but then reprogrammed by the future John Connor, why would Skynet, an artificial computer intelligence, bother to create a petite hot 17 year-old killer robot?\nLeonard: Skynet is kinky? I don\u2019t know. \nSheldon: Artificial intelligences do not have teen fetishes. \nLeonard: Alright, oh wait, they use it to in\u2026\nSheldon: (Buzzing noise), too late, I win. \nPenny (voice off, singing, quite tunelessly): Let\u2019s go-oh-oh Ou-oooo-ut tonight. I have to go-oh-oh-oh ou-ooooo-ut tonight. \nLeonard: What the hell is that? \nSheldon: I don\u2019t know, but if cats could sing, they\u2019d hate it too. (The continue up the stairs and disappear from view).\nPenny (still singing off): You wanna prowl, be my night owl, (Leonard and Sheldon reappear, running down the stairs) we\u2019ll take my\u2026 (appearing) Hey guys, hi! Where you going?\nLeonard: What? Oh we just had to\u2026 mail some letters and (seeing Sheldon has large bag in hand and bin is nearby) throw away some chicken. (Sheldon very reluctantly does.)\nPenny: You\u2019ll never guess what just happened.\nLeonard: Oh, I give up.\nSheldon: I don\u2019t guess. As a scientist I reach conclusions based on observation and experimentation, although as I\u2019m saying this it occurs to me you may have been employing a rhetorical device rendering my response moot. \nPenny: What was that?\nLeonard: Believe it or not, personal growth. What happened?\nPenny: Alright, remember when I auditioned for that workshop production of Rent, but I didn\u2019t get it and I couldn\u2019t figure out why?\nSheldon: I have a conclusion based on an observation.\nLeonard: No you don\u2019t. No he doesn\u2019t.\nPenny: Well, the girl they picked to play Mimi, she dropped out and they asked me to replace her. \nLeonard: Oh, congratulations, what a lucky break.\nPenny: It\u2019s not a big deal, just a one night showcase, but they invite a lot of casting people and agents so, you never know. \nSheldon: I think I know.\nLeonard: No you don\u2019t. He doesn\u2019t.\nPenny: It\u2019s this Friday at eight, you guys want to come?\nTogether: No.\nLeonard: Because\u2026. uh, Friday, we are attending a symposium on molecular positronium.\nSheldon: I think that\u2019s a week from Tuesday at six. \nLeonard: No, it\u2019s this Friday, at eight. \nPenny: Oh, too bad, well, I got to get to rehearsal, see you guys. \nLeonard: See you. (Penny exits singing) \nSheldon: You just lied to Penny.\nLeonard: Yes, I did. \nSheldon: And you did it so casually, no rapid breathing, no increase in perspiration.\nLeonard: So?\nSheldon: So, lack of a physiological response while lying is characteristic of a violent sociopath. \nLeonard: Sheldon, are you worried about your safety.\nSheldon: No, I imagine if you were going to kill me you\u2019d have done it a long time ago. \nLeonard: That\u2019s very true. \nLeonard exits. Sheldon looks worried for a moment, then retrieves the chicken from the bin and follows. \nCredits sequence\nScene: Outside Leonard\u2019s bedroom. \nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock, knock) Leonard, (Knock, knock, knock, knock) Leonard, (Knock, knock, knock, knock) Leonard\u2026\nLeonard: What?\nSheldon: I need to speak to you.\nLeonard: It\u2019s two o\u2019clock in the morning\nSheldon: It\u2019s important.\nLeonard: I highly doubt that. Go away. (Long pause). Are you still out there? \nSheldon: Yes. \nLeonard (opening door): What? \nSheldon: You\u2019re right, it can wait until morning. \nLeonard (following Sheldon into living room): What, what, what, what, what? \nSheldon: Never mind. I clearly woke you up in the middle of a REM cycle, you\u2019re in no state to talk.\nLeonard: Sheldon, what is it? \nSheldon: I\u2019m uncomfortable having been included in your lie to Penny. \nLeonard: What was I supposed to say. \nSheldon: You could have told her the truth.\nLeonard: That would have hurt her feelings. \nSheldon: Is that a relevant factor? \nLeonard: Yes.\nSheldon: Then I suppose you could have agreed to go. \nLeonard: And what would I have said afterwards? \nSheldon: I would suggest something to the effect of, singing is neither an appropriate vocation nor avocation for you, and if you disagree, I\u2019d recommend you have a CAT scan, to look for a tumour pressing on the cognitive processing centre of your brain.\nLeonard: I couldn\u2019t say that, I would have to say, you were terrific and I can\u2019t wait to hear you sing again. \nSheldon: Why? \nLeonard: It\u2019s the social protocol, it\u2019s what you do when you have a friend who\u2019s proud of something they really suck at. \nSheldon: I was not aware of that. \nLeonard: Well now you are.\nSheldon: Oh, alright. Leonard.\nLeonard: Yes.\nSheldon: When we played chess earlier, you were terrific and I can\u2019t wait to play you again. Goodnight. \nScene: Leonard\u2019s bedroom. \nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock, knock) Leonard, (Knock, knock, knock, knock) Leonard, (Knock, knock, knock, knock) Leonard, (Knock, knock, knock, knock) Leonard, (Knock, knock, knock, knock)\u2026.. \nLeonard: Oooaw. This would be so much easier if I were a violent sociopath. (Opening door) What?\nSheldon: I was analysing our lie, and I believe we\u2019re in danger of Penny seeing through the ruse.\nLeonard: How?\nSheldon: Simple. If she were to log on to www.socalphysicsgroup.org/activities/other, click on upcoming events, scroll down to seminars, download the pdf schedule, and look for the seminar on molecular positronium, well then, bippidy-boppidy-boo, our pants are metaphorically on fire. \nLeonard closes door. \nSheldon: Well, sir, my trousers will not be igniting today. \nScene: Outside Penny\u2019s door. \nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock, knock) Penny, (Knock, knock, knock, knock) Penny, (Knock, knock, knock, knock) Penny, (door opens) Good morning.\nPenny: Do you have any idea what time it is? \nSheldon: Of course I do. My watch is linked to the atomic clock in Boulder, Colorado. It\u2019s accurate to one tenth of a second. But as I\u2019m saying this it occurs to me that once again your question may have been rhetorical.\nPenny: What do you want?\nSheldon: Remember how Leonard told you we couldn\u2019t come to your performance because we were attending a symposium on molecular positronium?\nPenny: I remember symposium.\nSheldon: Yes, well, he lied.\nPenny: Wait, what?\nSheldon: He lied, and I\u2019m feeling very uncomfortable about it.\nPenny: Well imagine how I\u2019m feeling. \nSheldon: Hungry? Tired? I\u2019m sorry this really isn\u2019t my strong suit. \nScene: The living room. \nLeonard: You told her I lied, why would you tell her I lied?\nSheldon: To help you. \nLeonard: I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m not seeing the help.\nSheldon: She was going to see through your lie eventually, so I told her that you were lying to protect me. \nLeonard: Oh, I\u2019m getting a bad feeling. \nSheldon: Hunger? Indigestion, I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m really not very good at this. Anyway, Penny now believes that on Friday night, we\u2019re going to participate in my cousin Leopold\u2019s drug intervention. \nLeonard: Your cousin Leopold?\nSheldon: Yea, who most people call Leo, but he also answers to Lee, remember that, it\u2019s important. \nLeonard: What\u2019s important?\nSheldon: Details, Leonard, the success or failure of our deceitful enterprise turns on details. \nLeonard: Do you have a cousin Leopold.\nSheldon: No, I made him up. I think you\u2019d call him Lee. \nLeonard: I don\u2019t get it, I already told her a lie, why replace it with a different lie?\nSheldon: Well, first of all, your lie was laughably transparent, where mine is exquisitely convoluted. While you were sleeping I was weaving an un-unravelable web. \nLeonard: Un-unravelable?\nSheldon: Yes, if she googles Leopold Houston she\u2019ll find a facebook page, an online blog depicting his descent into drug use, and a desperate yet hopeful listing on e-harmony.com.\nLeonard: Okay, why would I go to a drug intervention for your cousing.\nSheldon: Ah, because it\u2019s in Long Beach, and I don\u2019t drive. \nLeonard: We\u2019re going to Long Beach?\nSheldon: No, of course not, there\u2019s no cousin Leo, there\u2019s no intervention, focus Leonard.\nLeonard: Oh, come on!\nSheldon: We just leave the house on Friday night, and we return in the wee hours emotionally wrung out from the work of convincing Leo to go back into rehab.\nLeonard: So he goes back into rehab?\nSheldon: Yes, but, he can relapse if Penny ever invites us to go hear her sing again.\nLeonard: You still told her I lied.\nSheldon: For a noble purpose, to spare me the social embarrassment of having a drug-addled first cousin, which I\u2019m assuming is embarrassing, yes?\nLeonard: I don\u2019t know. How am I supposed to remember all of this.\nSheldon: That\u2019s the best part, you don\u2019t have to, see I told Penny that you would be embarrassed, if you knew that she found out that you had lied, so she\u2019s agreed to operate as if the original lie was still in force. \nLeonard: So she\u2019s expecting me to lie about going to a symposium in Pasadena, when in actuality we\u2019re pretending to go to a drug intervention in Long Beach? \nSheldon: Un-unravelable. \nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard (opening door): Oh hey Penny, wow, look at you, all ready for your showcase, you look great.\nPenny: Thanks. I just wanted to come by and wish you guys luck with your symposium. \nLeonard: Oh, well, thankyou.\nPenny: You know, I got to tell you, a lot of friends would let their friend go alone, but that\u2019s not who you are, you are the kind of guy who stands by a friend when\u2026 when he has a symposium to go to. \nLeonard: I don\u2019t know what to say. \nPenny: It\u2019s okay, Leonard (hugs him.)\nLeonard: Oh, okay, alright, good. \nHoward (arriving): Oh boy, group hug.\nPenny: Uh-huh!\nHoward: Uh-huh?\nPenny: Uh-huh!\nHoward: Okay. So what\u2019s up? \nSheldon: Well, uh, Penny is on her way to perform in a one night showcase production of Rent, which we are unable to attend because we are going to a symposium on molecular positronium, given by Dr Emile Farminfarmian.\nHoward: Wait a minute, Farminfarmian is speaking and you\u2019re Bogarding the symposium. \nLeonard: Howard, I\u2019m sorry\u2026 we\u2019re\u2026 we\u2019re\nHoward: No, no, you\u2019re quark-blocking us. \nLeonard: I don\u2019t know what to say.\nHoward: Wow.\nLeonard: Howard, listen\u2026\nHoward: No, it\u2019s okay, it\u2019s your Millenium Falcon, you and Chewbacca do whatever you want to do. Me and Princess Leia here will find some other way to spend the evening. \nPenny: Howard, wait. Sheldon, I think we should tell them.\nSheldon: Okay, sure. I don\u2019t see a problem with that. \nPenny: There\u2019s no symposium, Leonard lied to me, isn\u2019t that right Leonard. \nLeonard: Well\u2026 I don\u2019t know what to say. \nPenny: It\u2019s okay, I do, look, Leonard is helping Sheldon through a family crisis, he made up the whole story about the symposium with Dr Farmin..farm\u2026ian\nSheldon: Good for you. \nPenny: Hah, yeah! Because he didn\u2019t want Sheldon to be embarrassed, and there is nothing to be embarrassed okay, every family in America has a relative holed up in a garage somewhere huffing paint thinner.\nHoward (after Raj whispers in his ear): No, I\u2019m lost too, I think she skipped a step. \nPenny: No, look, Sheldon\u2019s cousin Leo escaped rehab, and he\u2019s in a Motel 8 at Long Beach, the whole family\u2019s going out for an intervention. Leonard is driving Sheldon down there to help him through this because he\u2019s such a good man.\nLeonard: Oh, another hug, thank you.\nPenny: Alright you guys, good luck.\nLeonard: Thanks Penny. \nHoward: Yeah, uh, break a leg.\nSheldon: Break a leg. (She leaves)\nHoward: So, road trip to Long Beach.\nLeonard: No, we\u2019re not going to Long Beach.\nRaj: Why not? \nLeonard: Because Sheldon doesn\u2019t have a drug addicted cousin Leopold. \nRaj: Oh, too bad. I\u2019ve always wanted to go to Long Beach. \nSheldon: It\u2019s a very nice community. The Queen Mary is docked there, once the largest ocean liner in the world, it\u2019s now a hotel and restaurant where they host a surprisingly gripping murder mystery dinner. \nRaj: Sounds fun.\nHoward: I\u2019m game.\nRaj: Shotgun.\nSheldon: No, no, no, Leonard gets nauseous unless he sits in front, and even then it\u2019s iffy.\nLeonard: Wait, are we really going to Long Beach? \nScene: Leonard\u2019s bedroom. The bedside table is piled with Queen Mary memorabilia.\n\u00a0Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock, knock) Leonard, (Knock, knock, knock, knock) Leonard, (Knock, knock, knock, knock) Leonard\u2026\nLeonard: Let it go, Sheldon, the murderer was the first mate whether it makes sense to you or not. \nSheldon: No, that\u2019s the least of our worries. I\u2019ve been doing some research on addiction, both the biochemical and behavioural aspects, and I think there\u2019s a problem with the current version of our lie. \nLeonard: What are you talking about, it\u2019s fine, she bought it, it\u2019s over. \nSheldon: Sadly, it\u2019s not. Substance abuse is a lifelong struggle, but beyond that I have realised that the Leo I described would not have agreed to go to rehab.\nLeonard: Why not? \nSheldon: Because Leo is a middle child. \nLeonard: There is no Leo, how can you say that? \nSheldon: You didn\u2019t read the bio, did you? He\u2019s not just a middle child, he\u2019s the quintessential middle child, from a broken home to boot. Psychologically speaking, the attention he gets by rebelling even to the point of self-destruction is more emotionally valuable than the help he would get at rehab.\nLeonard: I\u2019ve got a solution.\nSheldon: Great, what is it?\nLeonard: Get out.\nSheldon: Fine. (He leaves. A moment later he comes back.) I\u2019ve hesitated to point this out, but I must now remind you that we are in our current predicament because of your initial and totally inadequate deceit. I\u2019m just trying to clean up after your mess. (Leonard throws a glass ornament at him. He just manages to shut the door in time.) We\u2019ll talk in the morning.\nScene: The living room. Leonard enters in his dressing gown. There is a strange man eating cereal at the kitchen table. \nStrange man: Morning. \nLeonard: Who are you? \nMan: I am Sheldon\u2019s cousin Leo.\nLeonard: Oh, God! Sheldon does not have a cousin Leo.\nMan: Au contraire. I\u2019m 26 years old, I\u2019m originally from (reads off crib notes) Denton, Texas, but I was a Navy brat so I was brought up on a variety of military bases around the world, as a result I\u2019ve often felt like an outsider, never really fitting in, which is probably the reason for my substance abuse problem.\nSheldon: Excuse me, we just went over this. As the quintessential middle child, your addiction is rooted in your unmet need for attention.\nMan: Oh, Sheldon, are we really going to go with pop psychology.\nSheldon: For your information, this is all based on solid research, stick with the character profile I wrote for you. \nLeonard: Sheldon?\nSheldon: I\u2019m sorry, Leonard, this is Toby Loobenfeld, he\u2019s a research assistant in the particle physics lab, but he also minored in theatre at MIT.\nToby: It was more of a double major actually. Theatre and physics. You can guess which one my bourgeois parents pushed me towards. \nLeonard: Yeah, I got it, Sheldon, why?\nSheldon: Well, you see, while Leo would not have gone into rehab, it is completely plausible that we would have talked him into leaving the motel, and coming home with us.\nLeonard: Oh\u2026!\nToby: Sheldon, how about this as my motivation. When I was fourteen years old I was abused in the Philippines by a club footed Navy chaplain.\nSheldon: No. We\u2019re going with middle child, and a generic predisposition to inadequate serotonin production.\nToby: Swell, how do I play genetic predisposition?\nSheldon: Subtextually, of course. (There is a knock on the door.) Just have fun with it. (Opening door.) Morning Penny.\nPenny: Hi. How did the intervention go.\nSheldon: Unfortunately, we weren\u2019t able to convince him to go to rehab. \nPenny: Well, based on what you told me, I\u2019m not surprised. \nSheldon: But we did convince him to leave the motel. Come say hello. Leo, this is Penny, our friend and neighbour.\nPenny: Hi Leo, how are you feeling?\nToby: Let me ask you something, Penny. Have you ever woken up in a fleabag motel, covered in your own vomit, next to a transsexual prostitute? \nPenny: No.\nToby: Then don\u2019t ask me how I\u2019m feeling. \nLeonard: Well, that\u2019s Leo. Hey, um, why don\u2019t you tell me about your showcase last night?\nPenny: Oh, it was okay I guess, wasn\u2019t a big turn out but they both really seemed to like it. \nLeonard: There were only two people there?\nPenny: By the end. Yeah. \nToby: Damn you, Chaplain Horrigan! \nPenny: I\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m sorry.\nToby: The Philippines. 1992. The Subic Bay Naval Station. A young boy on the cusp of manhood. His only companions mongrel dogs and malarial mosquitos. Desperate and alone he reached out to a man who promised to introduce him to a merciful, loving God, but who instead introduced him to a gin pickled tongue shoved down his adolescent throat. What choice did he have but to drink, shoot and snort his pain away.\nSheldon: Don\u2019t forget his genetic predisposition towards addiction.\nToby: That\u2019s never been proven.\nSheldon: There have been studies.\nToby: Not double blind studies.\nSheldon: How could there be a double blind study, who would be the control group. \nLeonard: As you can see, detoxing can get pretty ugly, let\u2019s give them some privacy.\nPenny: Yeah. Hey, do you want to come over to my place, have coffee?\nLeonard: Sounds good.\nPenny: I have a video of me singing last night, do you want to see it? \nLeonard: Gee, why wouldn\u2019t I?\nPenny: This is even better than you coming to the showcase, because now I get to watch you watch me.\nLeonard: Yeah! Funny how things work out. \nToby: And that he loved the companionship and the wisdom that his own father failed to provide. \nSheldon: Your parents made the right decision. \nToby: I cannot work like this! \nScene: The apartment. Penny is on the sofa with Toby. They are watching TV.\nToby: This is amazing. Just sitting on a couch, watching TV with a woman. Not being drunk, or high, or\u2026 or\u2026 wondering if you\u2019re a dude down there.\nPenny: Leo, you are a very sweet, really funny guy. You\u2019re gonna do okay. \nToby: One day at a time, Penny, one day at a time. \nLeonard: How long is he going to stay here.\nSheldon: He\u2019s a homeless drug addict, Leonard, where is he going to go? Boy, you have a lot to learn about lying.\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "1_6": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: Lobby of the apartment building, Howard, Raj, Sheldon and Leonard enter in combat gear, covered in blue paint.\nRaj: Okay, if no-one else will say it, I will. We really suck at paintball.\nHoward: That was absolutely humiliating.\nLeonard: Oh, come on, some battles you win, some battles you lose.\nHoward: Yes, but you don\u2019t have to lose to Kyle Bernstein\u2019s Bar-Mitzvah party. \nLeonard: I think we have to acknowledge, those were some fairly savage pre-adolescent Jews. \nSheldon: You know, we were annihilated by our own incompetence and the inability of some people to follow the chain of command. \nLeonard: Sheldon, let it go.\nSheldon: No, I want to talk about the fact that Wolowitz shot me in the back. \nHoward: I shot you for good reason, you were leading us into disaster. \nSheldon: I was giving clear, concise orders. \nLeonard: You hid behind a tree yelling \u201cget the kid in the yarmulkah, get the kid in the yarmulkah.\u201d\nPenny (arriving): Oh, hey guys.\nLeonard: Hello Penny.\nHoward: Morning ma\u2019am. \nPenny: So, how was paintball, did you have fun?\nSheldon: Sure, if you consider being fragged by your own troops fun. (To Howard) You clear space on your calendar, there will be an enquiry.\nPenny: Okay, um, oh hey, I\u2019m having a party on Saturday so if you guys are around you should come by.\nLeonard: A party? \nPenny: Yeah.\nHoward: A boy-girl party?\nPenny: Well, there will be boys, and there will be girls, and it is a party. So, it\u2019ll just be a bunch of my friends, we\u2019ll have some beer, do a little dancing\u2026\nSheldon: Dancing?\nLeonard: Yeah, I don\u2019t know, Penny\u2026\nSheldon: The thing is, we\u2019re not\u2026.\nLeonard: We\u2019re really more\u2026.\nSheldon: No.\nLeonard: But thanks, thanks for thinking of us.\nPenny: Are you sure? Come on, it\u2019s Halloween.\nSheldon: A Halloween party?\nHoward: As in, costumes? \nPenny: Well, yeah. \nLeonard: Is there a theme?\nPenny: Um, yeah, Halloween.\nSheldon: Yes, but are the costumes random, or genre specific? \nPenny: As usual, I\u2019m not following.\nLeonard: He\u2019s asking if we can come as anyone from science-fiction, fantasy\u2026\nPenny: Sure.\nSheldon: What about comic-books?\nPenny: Fine.\nSheldon: Anime?\nPenny: Of course.\nSheldon: TV , film, D&D, Manga, Greek Gods, Roman Gods, Norse Gods\u2026\nPenny: Anything you want, okay? Any costume you want. Bye. \nHoward: Gentlemen, to the sewing machines.\nCredits Sequence\nScene: The apartment living room. There is a knock on the door.\nLeonard (off): I\u2019ll get it. (He enters, wearing a Flash costume. Opens door.)\nHoward (Entering at speed, also wearing a Flash costume): Bjow (They stare at each other in shock.)\nLeonard: Oh, no. \nSheldon: Oh no! (He is also wearing a Flash costume.)\nRaj: Make way for the fastest man alive. (Enters, also in a Flash costume.) Oh no!\nSheldon: See, this is why I wanted to have a costume meeting. \nLeonard: We all have other costumes, we can change.\nRaj: Or, we could walk right behind each other all night and look like one person going really fast. \nHoward: No, no, no, it\u2019s a boy-girl party, this Flash runs solo. \nLeonard: Okay, how about this, nobody gets to be The Flash, we all change, agreed?\nAll: Agreed. \nLeonard: I call Frodo!\nAll: Damn!\nScene: The same, later. Leonard is dressed as Frodo. Howard appears to be Peter Pan. There is a knock on the door.\nRaj (Entering dressed as Thor): Hey. Sorry I\u2019m late, but my hammer got stuck in the door on the bus.\nLeonard: You went with Thor?\nRaj: What? Just because I\u2019m Indian I can\u2019t be a Norse God? No, no, no, Raj has to be an Indian God. That\u2019s racism. I mean, look at Wolowitz, he\u2019s not English, but he\u2019s dressed like Peter Pan. Sheldon(entering in a body suit featuring black and white vertical lines) is neither sound nor light, but he\u2019s obviously the Doppler Effect. \nHoward: I\u2019m not Peter Pan, I\u2019m Robin Hood. \nRaj: Really, because I saw Peter Pan, and you\u2019re dressed exactly like Cathy Rigby. She was a little bigger than you, but it\u2019s basically the same look, man. \nLeonard: Hey, Sheldon, there\u2019s something I want to talk to you about before we go to the party.\nSheldon: I don\u2019t care if anybody gets it, I\u2019m going as the Doppler Effect. \nLeonard: No, it\u2019s not\u2026\nSheldon: If I have to, I can demonstrate. Neeeeoooowwwww!\nLeonard: Terrific. Um, this party is my first chance for Penny to see me in the context of her social group, and I need you not to embarrass me tonight. \nSheldon: Well, what exactly do you mean by embarrass you?\nLeonard: For example, tonight no-one needs to know that my middle name is Leakey. \nSheldon: Well, there\u2019s nothing embarrassing about that, your father worked with Lewis Leakey, a great anthropologist. It had nothing to do with your bed-wetting. \nLeonard: All I\u2019m saying is that this party is the perfect opportunity for Penny to see me as a member of her peer group. A potential close friend and\u2026 perhaps more. I don\u2019t want to look like a dork. \nScene: The hallway. Howard knocks on Penny\u2019s door with his bow. \nHoward: Just a heads up fellas, if anyone gets lucky I\u2019ve got a dozen condoms in my quiver. \nPenny (opening door, not in costume): Oh, hey guys. \nLeonard: Hey, sorry we\u2019re late. \nPenny: Late? It\u2019s 7:05.\nSheldon: And you said the party starts at seven. \nPenny: Well, yeah, when you start a party at seven, no-one shows up at, you know, seven. \nSheldon: It\u2019s 7:05. \nPenny: Yes. Yes it is. Okay, well, um, come on in. \nHoward: What, are all the girls in the bathroom?\nPenny: Probably, but in their own homes. \nSheldon: So what time does the costume parade start? \nPenny: The parade?\nSheldon: Yeah, so the judges can give out the prizes for best costume, you know, most frightening, most authentic, most accurate visual representation of a scientific principle.\nPenny: Oh, Sheldon, I\u2019m sorry but there aren\u2019t going to be any parades or judges or prizes. \nSheldon: This party is just going to suck. \nPenny: No, come on, it\u2019s going to be fun, and you all look great, I mean, look at you, Thor, and, oh, Peter Pan, that\u2019s so cute.\nLeonard: Actually, Penny, he\u2019s Rob\u2026\nHoward: I\u2019m Peter Pan! And I\u2019ve got a handful of pixie dust with your name on it. \nPenny: No you don\u2019t. Oh, hey, what\u2019s Sheldon supposed to be.\nLeonard: Oh, he\u2019s the Doppler Effect.\nSheldon: Yes. It\u2019s the apparent change in the frequency of a wave caused by relative motion between the source of the wave and the observer. \nPenny: Oh, sure, I see it now, the Doppler Effect. Alright, I\u2019ve got to shower, you guys um, make yourselves comfortable. \nLeonard: Okay. \nSheldon: See, people get it. \nTime shift, the party is in full swing, the four guys are sitting together around the coffee table. \nRaj: Mmmm, by Odin\u2019s beard, this is good Chex Mix. \nHoward: No thanks, peanuts, I can\u2019t afford to swell up in these tights. \nSheldon: I\u2019m confused. If there\u2019s no costume parade, what are we doing here? \nLeonard: We\u2019re socialising. Meeting new people. \nSheldon: Telepathically?\nPenny (crossing the room in a cat costume, speaking to someone off-screen): Oh hey, when did you get here, Hi!\nRaj: Penny is wearing the worst Catwoman costume I have ever seen, and that includes Halle Berry\u2019s.\nLeonard: She\u2019s not Catwoman, she\u2019s just a generic cat.\nSheldon: And that\u2019s the kind of sloppy costuming which results from a lack of rules and competition.\nHoward: Hey guys, check out the sexy nurse. I believe it\u2019s time for me to turn my head and cough. \nRaj: What is your move?\nHoward: I\u2019m going to use the mirror technique. She brushes her hair back, I brush my hair back, she shrugs, I shrug, subconsciously she\u2019s thinking we\u2019re in sync, we belong together.\nLeonard: Where do you get this stuff?\nHoward: You know, psychology journals, internet research, and there\u2019s this great show on VH1 about how to pick up girls. \nRaj: Oh, if only I had his confidence. I have such difficulty speaking to women. Or around women. Or at times, even effeminate men. \nHoward: If that\u2019s a working stethoscope, maybe you\u2019d like to hear my heart skip a beat.\nNurse Costume Girl: No thanks.\nHoward: No, seriously, you can, I have transient idiopathic arrhythmia.\nLeonard: I\u00a0 want to get to know Penny\u2019s friends, I just, I don\u2019t know how to talk to these people. \nSheldon: Well, I actually might be able to help.\nLeonard: How so?\nSheldon: Like Jane Goodall observing the apes, I initially saw their interactions as confusing and unstructured, but patterns emerge, they have their own language if you will. \nLeonard: Go on.\nSheldon: Well, it seems that the newcomer approaches the existing group with the greeting \u201cHow wasted am I?\u201d which is met with an approving chorus of \u201cDude.\u201d\nLeonard: Then what happens?\nSheldon: That\u2019s as far as I\u2019ve gotten.\nLeonard: This is ridiculous, I\u2019m jumping in.\nSheldon: Good luck. \nLeonard: No, you\u2019re coming with me.\nSheldon: Oh, I hardly think so. \nLeonard: Come on.\nSheldon: Aren\u2019t you afraid I\u2019ll embarrass you?\nLeonard: Yes. But I need a wing-man.\nSheldon: Alright, but if we\u2019re going to use flight metaphors I\u2019m much more suited to being the guy from the FAA, analysing wreckage. \nGirl in Hippie Costume: Oh, Hi!\nLeonard: Hi.\nSheldon: Hello.\nGirl: So, what are you supposed to be?\nSheldon: Me? I\u2019ll give you a hint. Neeeeooooowwwww!\nGirl: Uh, a choo-choo train?\nSheldon: Close! Neeeeeoooooowwwww!\nGirl: A brain damaged choo-choo train?\nGirl in Butterfly Costume (dropping onto sofa next to Raj): How wasted am I? (Raj shrugs.)\nTime shift. Sheldon and Leonard are now talking to a girl in a princess costume.\nSheldon: Neeeeeooooowwwwww!\nGirl: I still don\u2019t get it.\nSheldon: I\u2019m the Doppler Effect. \nGirl: Okay, if that is some sort of learning disability, I think it\u2019s very insensitive.\nLeonard: Why don\u2019t you just tell people you\u2019re a zebra?\n\u00a0Sheldon: Well, why don\u2019t you just tell people you\u2019re one of the seven dwarves. \nLeonard: Because I\u2019m Frodo.\nSheldon: Yes, well, I\u2019m the Doppler Effect. \nLeonard: Oh no.\nSheldon: What?\nLeonard: That\u2019s Penny\u2019s ex-boyfriend.\nSheldon: What do you suppose he\u2019s doing here? Besides disrupting the local gravity field. \nLeonard: If he were any bigger, he\u2019d have moons orbiting him.\nSheldon: Oh, snap. So I guess we\u2019ll be leaving now. \nLeonard: Why should we leave? For all we know, he crashed the party and Penny doesn\u2019t even want him here. (Penny and Kurt hug).\nSheldon: You have a back-up hypothesis. \nLeonard: Maybe they just want to be friends. \nSheldon: Or maybe she wants to be friends, and he wants something more. \nLeonard: Then he and I are on equal ground.\nSheldon: Yes, but you\u2019re much closer to it than he is. \nLeonard: Look, if this was 15,000 years ago, by virtue of his size and strength, Kurt would be entitled to his choice of female partners.\nSheldon: And male partners. Animal partners. Large primordial eggplants, pretty much whatever tickled his fancy. \nLeonard: Yes, but our society has undergone a paradigm shift, in the information age, Sheldon, you and I are the alpha males. We shouldn\u2019t have to back down. \nSheldon: True. Why don\u2019t you text him that and see if he backs down?\nLeonard: No. I\u2019m going to assert my dominance face to face. \nSheldon: Face to face? Are you going to wait for him to sit down, or are you going to stand on a coffee table?\nLeonard: Hello Penny. Hello Kurt.\nPenny: Oh, hey guys. You having a good time?\nSheldon: Given the reaction to my costume, this party is a scathing indictment of the American education system. \nKurt: What, you\u2019re a zebra, right?\nSheldon: Yet another child left behind. \nKurt: And what are you supposed to be, an Elf?\nLeonard: No, I\u2019m a Hobbit.\nKurt: What\u2019s the difference? \nLeonard: Uh, a Hobbit is a mortal Halfling inhabitant of Middle Earth, whereas an Elf is an immortal tall warrior. \nKurt: So why the hell would you want to be a Hobbit?\nSheldon: Because he is neither tall nor immortal, and none of us could be The Flash. \nKurt: Well, whatever, why don\u2019t you go hop off on a quest, I\u2019m talking to Penny here.\nLeonard: I think we\u2019re all talking to Penny here.\nSheldon: I\u2019m not. No offence. \nKurt: Okay, maybe you didn\u2019t hear me, go away.\nPenny: Alright Kurt, be nice.\nKurt: Aw, I am being nice. Right little buddy.\nPenny: Kurt!\nLeonard: Okay, I understand your impulse to try to physically intimidate me. I mean, you can\u2019t compete with me on an intellectual level and so you\u2019re driven to animalistic puffery. \nKurt: Are you calling me a puffy animal?\nPenny: Of course not, no, he\u2019s not, you\u2019re not, right Leonard? \nLeonard: No, I said animalistic. Of course we\u2019re all animals, but some of us have climbed a little higher on the evolutionary tree. \nSheldon: If he understands that, you\u2019re in trouble. \nKurt: So what, I\u2019m unevolved?\nSheldon: You\u2019re in trouble. \nKurt: You know, you use a lot of big words for such a little dwarf. \nPenny: Okay, Kurt, please.\nLeonard: No, Penny, it\u2019s okay, I can handle this. I\u2019m not a dwarf, I\u2019m a Hobbit. A Hobbit. Are misfiring neurons in your hippocampus preventing the conversion from short-term to long-term memory?\nKurt: Okay, now you\u2019re starting to make me mad. \nLeonard: A homo-habilus discovering his opposable thumbs says what?\nKurt: What?\nLeonard: I think I\u2019ve made my point.\nKurt: Yeah, how about I make a point out of your pointy little head.\nSheldon: Let me remind you, while my moral support is absolute, in a physical confrontation I will be less than useless. \nLeonard: There\u2019s not going to be a confrontation, in fact I doubt if he can even spell confrontation.\nKurt (physically lifting Leonard from the ground): C \u2013 O \u2013 N\u2026 frontation!\nPenny: Kurt, put him down this instant. \nKurt: He started it.\nPenny: I don\u2019t care, I\u2019m finishing it, put him down. \nKurt: Fine. You\u2019re one lucky little leprechaun. \nSheldon: He\u2019s a Hobbit! I\u2019ve got your back. \nPenny: Leonard, are you okay.\nLeonard: Yeah, no, I\u2019m fine. It\u2019s good, it\u2019s a good party, thanks for having us, it\u2019s just getting a little late so\u2026.\nPenny: Oh, okay, alright, well thank you for coming. \nSheldon: Happy Halloween. (They leave) If it\u2019s any consolation, I thought that homo-habilus line really put him in his place. \nScene: The living room. Sheldon brings Leonard a cup of tea.\nLeonard: What\u2019s that?\nSheldon: Tea. When people are upset the cultural convention is to bring them hot beverages. There there. You want to talk about it?\nLeonard: No.\nSheldon: Good. There there was really all I had. \nLeonard: Good night Sheldon.\nSheldon: Good night Leonard. \nPenny (knocking on door and entering): Hey Leonard.\nLeonard: Hi Penny.\nPenny: Hey, I just wanted to make sure you\u2019re okay.\nLeonard: I\u2019m fine. \nPenny: I\u2019m so sorry about what happened.\nLeonard: It\u2019s not your fault.\nPenny: Yes it is. That\u2019s why I broke up with him, he always does stuff like that. \nLeonard: So why was he at your party?\nPenny: Well, I ran into him last week and, he was\u2026 \u00a0just, all apologetic, about how he\u2019s changed, he was just going on and on and I believed him, and I\u2019m an idiot because I always believe guys like that and\u2026 I can\u2019t go back to my party because he\u2019s there, and I know you don\u2019t want to hear this and I\u2019m upset and I\u2019m really drunk and I just want to\u2026 (bursts into tears and rests head on Leonard\u2019s shoulder.)\nLeonard: There there. \nPenny: God, what is wrong with me.\nLeonard: Nothing, you\u2019re perfect.\nPenny: Gah, I\u2019m not perfect.\nLeonard: Yes you are. \nPenny: You really think so, don\u2019t you? (She kisses hm.)\nLeonard: Penny?\nPenny: Yeah. \nLeonard: How much have you had to drink tonight?\nPenny: Just\u2026. a lot. \nLeonard: Are you sure that your being drunk, and your being angry with Kurt doesn\u2019t have something to do with what\u2019s going on here?\nPenny: It might. Boy, you\u2019re really smart.\nLeonard: Yeah, I\u2019m a frickin\u2019 genius. \nPenny: Leonard, you are so great. Why can\u2019t all guys be like you? \nLeonard: Because if all guys were like me, the human race couldn\u2019t survive. \nPenny: I should probably go.\nLeonard: Probably. \nPenny (in doorway): Thank you. (She kisses him again. Kurt is watching.)\nLeonard: That\u2019s right, you saw what you saw. That\u2019s how we roll in The Shire. (Closes door quickly, locks and chains it.)\nScene: The apartment, there is a knock on the door. \nSheldon: Coming. (Opens door to Howard.)\nHoward: Hey, have you seen Koothrapali?\nSheldon: He\u2019s not here. Maybe the Avenger summoned him. \nHoward: He\u2019s not the Marvel comic story, he\u2019s the original Norse God. \nSheldon: Thank you for the clarification. \nHoward: I\u2019m supposed to give him a ride home.\nSheldon: Well I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be fine. He has his hammer. \nScene: A random bedroom. Butterfly costume girl is climbing off of Raj. \nButterfly Girl: Wow, I have to say, you are an amazing man. You\u2019re gentle and passionate, and my God, you are such a good listener! \n(Raj puts hands behind head with a smug expression on his face.)\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "2_1": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The stairwell.\nLeonard: So you see, what you\u2019re eating is not technically yoghurt, because it doesn\u2019t have enough live acidophilus cultures. It\u2019s really just iced milk with carragenin added for thickness. \nPenny: Oh, that\u2019s very interesting.\nLeonard: It\u2019s also not pink and has no berries.\nPenny: Yeah, but it doesn\u2019t really answer my question.\nLeonard: What was your question again?\nPenny: Do you want some.\nLeonard: Oh, right, no, I\u2019m lactose intolerant.\nPenny: Right.\nLeonard: So, gas.\nPenny: Got it. \nLeonard: Well, good night. (They kiss. Camera cuts away to a wall mounted security cam above the lift. Leonard spots its movement and shuffles Penny away.)\nPenny: What are you doing?\nLeonard: There was a draft.\nPenny: I didn\u2019t feel a draft. \nLeonard: Why don\u2019t we just go into your\u2026.\nPenny: Oh, yeah, you know what, maybe we should just slow things down a little.\nLeonard: No, no, I didn\u2019t mean to go into your apartment to\u2026 go fast. \nPenny: No, I know, I\u2026 I know what you meant, it\u2019s just\u2026 it\u2019s only our first date.\nLeonard: Yeah, okay, sure, no problem, why don\u2019t we just figure out where we\u2019re going, and when we want to get there, and then rate of speed equals distance over time. Solve for R.\nPenny: Or we could just wing it. \nLeonard: That might work too. \nPenny: Goodnight Leonard.\nLeonard: Goodnight. (He throws the camera a dirty look.) \nCut to inside the apartment.\nRaj: He\u2019s coming. Screen saver. \nHoward: Oh, hey, Leonard, how was your date?\nLeonard: Bite me. Sheldon, how could you just sit there and let them spy on me?\nSheldon: They were clever, Leonard. They exploited my complete lack of interest in what you were doing. \nHoward: You should thank us. When future generations try to determine why your relationship with Penny crashed and burned, this right here is the black box. \nLeonard: What are you talking about, the date went fine. \nRaj: Dude, she said she wants to slow things down.\nLeonard: Okay, so, she said she wants to slow things down. It\u2019s like saying \u201cI\u2019m really enjoying this meal, I\u2019m going to slow down and savour it.\u201d \nHoward: No, it\u2019s like \u201cthis fish tastes bad, so I\u2019m going to slow down and spit it out.\u201d\nRaj: You being the fish.\nLeonard: I\u2019m not the fish. \nHoward: Oh really, did you make a second date.\nLeonard: Well, we sort of decided to wing it. \nSheldon: Oh, even I know that\u2019s lame. \nLeonard: Okay, alright, let\u2019s assume your hypothesis. We went to dinner, we talked, we laughed, we kissed, where could I have possibly gone wrong. \n\u00a0Howard: Think back, Leonard, the littlest things can set women off. Like, hey, the waitress is hot, I bet we could get her to come home with us. Or, how much does your mom weigh, I want to know what I\u2019m getting into.\nLeonard: I didn\u2019t say anything like that.\nHoward: Good, \u2018cos they don\u2019t work. \nRaj: They also don\u2019t care for it if you stare at them and hyperventilate. Sadly, that\u2019s my home run swing. \nLeonard: Look, everything went fine. I didn\u2019t even have to refer to my impromptu conversation starters. The woman across the hall is into me. \nHoward: Let\u2019s go to the tape. Look at her reaction to the goodnight kiss, no change in respiration, pupils un-dilated, no flushing of the chest.\nRaj: Nice close up, by the way. \nSheldon: Interesting, her jaws are clenched, no tongue access, clearly a bad sign amongst mating humans. \nLeonard: That\u2019s not a bad sign.\nSheldon: Please, you might as well have been two iguana with no dewlap enlargement. \nRaj: And the worst sign of all is, you\u2019re here and not there. \nLeonard: I\u2019m not there because I\u2019m taking things slow. Which, by the way, compared to you guys approaches warp speed. And take down that camera. \nRaj: He was a lot more fun when he had no hope. \nHoward: Give him time.\nCredits sequence\nScene: The laundry room. Sheldon is folding shirts. \nPenny (entering): Hi.\nSheldon: Oh, hi Penny. FYI, the hot water is inadequate on machine 2 so colours only, and 4 is still releasing the fabric softener too early in the cycle so I\u2019d avoid using that for your delicates. \nPenny (tipping all her laundry into one machine at once): Thanks. \nSheldon: Oh, good Lord. Why don\u2019t you just take your clothes down to the river and beat them with a rock? \nPenny: Sheldon, may I ask you a question? \nSheldon: I would prefer that you not, but I won\u2019t go so far as to forbid it. \nPenny: Alright, I heard yes, so\u2026 okay, here\u2019s my question, has Leonard ever dated, you know, a regular girl. \nSheldon: Well I assume you\u2019re not referring to digestive regularity? Because I\u2019ve come to learn that such inquiries are inappropriate. \nPenny: No, I meant has he ever been involved with someone who wasn\u2019t a braniac? \nSheldon: Oh. Well, a few years ago he did go out with a woman who had a PhD in French Literature. \nPenny: How is that not a braniac? \nSheldon: Well, for one thing, she was French. For another, it was literature. \nPenny: So, do you think that if Leonard and I keep dating he\u2019ll eventually get bored with me. \nSheldon: That depends.\nPenny: On what? \nSheldon: Do you have a working knowledge of quantum physics? \nPenny: No.\nSheldon: Do you speak Klingon? \nPenny: No.\nSheldon: Do you know any card tricks?\nPenny: Okay, okay, you know, I get it, Leonard has no business being involved with a waitress slash actress who felt so insecure that she lied to him about finishing community college. \nSheldon: Why would you lie about that?\nPenny: Well, he was going on and on about this college and that grad school and I didn\u2019t want him to think I was some stupid loser. \nSheldon: You thought the opposite of stupid loser was community college graduate? \nPenny: You know, there are a lot of successful people in this country who are community college graduates. \nSheldon: Yeah, but you were neither. \nPenny: Right, okay look, this is between you and me, you cannot tell Leonard any of this. \nSheldon: You\u2019re asking me to keep a secret?\nPenny: Yeah. \nSheldon: Well I\u2019m sorry, but you would have had to express that desire before revealing the secret, so that I could choose whether or not I wanted to accept the covenant of secret keeping. You can\u2019t impose a secret on an ex post facto basis. \nPenny: What? \nSheldon: Secret keeping is a complicated endeavour. One has to be concerned not only about what one says, but about facial expression, autonomic reflexes, when I try to deceive, I myself have more nervous tics than a lyme disease research facility. (Long pause.) It\u2019s a joke. It relies on the hominymic relationship between tick the blood-sucking arachnid, and tic the involuntary muscular contraction. I made it up myself. \nPenny: Okay, look, if Leonard finds out that I lied, I will absolutely die of embarrassment. \nSheldon: Physiologically impossible.\nPenny: Oh Sheldon, please, look, I\u2019m asking you as a friend. \nSheldon: So you\u2019re saying that friendship contains within it an inherent obligation to maintain confidences?\nPenny: Well, yeah. \nSheldon: Interesting. See, one more question, and perhaps I should have led with this, when did we become friends? \nScene: The stairwell.\nSheldon: I.e, I couldn\u2019t become Green Lantern unless I was chosen by the guardians of Oa, but given enough start-up capital and an adequate research facility, I could be Batman.\nLeonard: You could be Batman?\nSheldon: Sure. (In a gravelly voice) I\u2019m Batman. See.\nPenny (arriving): Hi guys.\nLeonard: Hey.\nSheldon (looking the other way uncomfortably): Hi Penny.\nLeonard: Hey, Penny, if you\u2019re not doing anything Friday night I thought maybe we could go and see a movie. \nPenny: Oh, um, you know, I think I have the dinner shift on Friday.\nLeonard: What about Saturday?\nPenny: You know, I\u2019m not sure, the manager hasn\u2019t posted the schedule yet, how about I let you know.\nLeonard: Great. So you just let me know when you know. So\u2026 (she leaves) Oh God, I am the bad fish! What did I do wrong?\nSheldon: Why are you asking me, I have no information about your interactions with Penny other than what you provided me, nor do I have any method of learning such things. (Runs away.) \nLeonard (chasing him): What does that mean?\nSheldon: Nothing. You seem to be implying an informational back channel between me and Penny where obviously none exists.\nLeonard: No I didn\u2019t.\nSheldon: I just think you need to be careful how you phrase things, sir. \nLeonard: What\u2019s going on with you?\nSheldon: Well I might ask you the same question. Why do you insist on attempting to drag me into matters which have nothing to do with me? But exist between you and Penny. A person to whom I barely speak. (His eye begins to twitch.) \nLeonard: What\u2019s wrong with your face? \nSheldon: There\u2019s no reason to bring my looks into this. Good day, Leonard.\nLeonard: What? \nSheldon: I said Good Day! (He leaves)\nLeonard: Good day? \nScene: The Cheesecake Factory\nPenny: Also today we have a fresh caught Alaska salmon, and that\u2019s served with a teriyaki glaze and sticky rice. Our soup of the day\u2026\nSheldon (appearing behind her): You must release me from my oath. \nPenny: Sheldon, I\u2019m working.\nSheldon: Why don\u2019t you take a minute to decide (leads her away) I can\u2019t keep your secret Penny. I\u2019m going to fold like an energy based anobo protein in conformational space. Like a renaissance triptych. Like a cheap suit.\nPenny: Oh, look, why is it so hard for you to keep one little secret?\nSheldon: I\u2019m constitutionally incapable. That\u2019s why I was refused clearance for a very prestigious government research fellowship at a secret military supercollider, located beneath a fake agricultural station 12.5 miles south east of Travers City, Michigan. Which you did not hear about from me. \nPenny: Look, just forget I told you about me not graduating from community college. Okay?\nSheldon: Forget! You want me to forget? This mind does not forget. I haven\u2019t forgotten a single thing since the day my mother stopped breast feeding me. It was a drizzly Tuesday.\nPenny: Okay, look, you promised me you would keep my secret so you\u2019re just going to have to figure out a way to do it.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon (entering): Leonard, I\u2019m moving out. \nLeonard: What do you mean, you\u2019re moving out? Why? \nSheldon: There doesn\u2019t have to be a reason. \nLeonard: Yeah, there kind of does.\nSheldon: Not necessarily. This is a classic example of munchausen\u2019s trilemma. Either the reason is predicated on a series of sub-reasons leading to an infinite regression, or it tracks back to arbitrary axiomatic statements, or it\u2019s ultimately circular, i.e., I\u2019m moving out because I\u2019m moving out. \nLeonard: I\u2019m still confused.\nSheldon: Leonard, I don\u2019t see how I could have made it any simpler. \nHoward (entering): Hey, qu\u2019est q\u2019wass up?\nRaj: We just got back from that exhibit of those plasticised human cadavers.\nHoward: And some of those skinless chicks were hot. \nSheldon: If you\u2019ll excuse me, I\u2019m going to pack. \nHoward: That\u2019s kind of an overreaction to a little harmless necrophilia. \nLeonard: It\u2019s not you, Howard, he says he\u2019s moving out. \nRaj: What did you do? Did you change the contrast or brightness settings on the television?\nLeonard: No.\nRaj: Did you take a band aid off in front of him? \nLeonard: No.\nHoward: Did you buy generic ketchup, forget to rinse the sink, talk to him through the bathroom door? \nRaj: Adjust the thermostat, cook with cilantro, pronounce the T in often? \nLeonard: No. \nHoward: Did you make fun of trains? \nLeonard: I didn\u2019t do anything, he\u2019s just gone insane.\nRaj: Well, we all knew this day was coming. \nLeonard: That was fast. \nSheldon: It\u2019s my pre-packed disaster evacuation bag. Recommended by the department of homeland security. And Sarah Connor. \nLeonard: Where are you gonna live? \nSheldon: Until I find a permanent place I will stay with friends. \nHoward: Bye (runs out.) \nRaj: Well you can\u2019t stay with me, I have a teeny tiny apartment. \nSheldon: Excuse me, but isn\u2019t hosting guests an aspect of Menushya Yajna, one of the five central religious duties or sacrifices of the Hindu householder? \nRaj: I hate trains. \nSheldon: Don\u2019t be ridiculous, you love trains. \nRaj: Yes I do, come on. See you later Leonard. (Sheldon drops keys in bowl and leaves without a word.)\nLeonard: This could work. \nScene: Raj\u2019s apartment. \nSheldon: This is a very old building. \nRaj: Sixty years. Used to be a watch factory. \nSheldon: Uh-oh.\nRaj: What? \nSheldon: Don\u2019t you worry about the residual radium from the luminous dials?\nRaj: Not until now. \nSheldon: I can\u2019t believe I didn\u2019t bring my gieger counter. You know, I had it on my bed and I didn\u2019t pack it. \nRaj: Well, if you\u2019re not comfortable staying here, Sheldon\u2026\nSheldon: I\u2019m kidding, I packed it. It was a joke, I was subverting the conversational expectations. I believe they call that the, um, old switcheroo. \nRaj: Terrific. \nSheldon (referring to Bollywood singing on television): Is that woman Aishwarya Rai?\nRaj: Yes, isn\u2019t she an amazing actress.\nSheldon: Actually, I\u2019d say she\u2019s a poor man\u2019s Madhuri Dixit. \nRaj: How dare you. Aishwarya Rai is a Goddess. By comparison Madhuri Dixit is a leprous prostitute.\nSheldon: Sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to offend you. Obviously you\u2019re not that familiar with Indian cinema. \nScene: Howard\u2019s house. The door rings. \nHoward: Who is it?\nVoice: Strippergram. (Howard opens door. Outside are Raj and Sheldon.)\nRaj: Tag. You\u2019re it. (Runs away.) \nHoward: Shouldn\u2019t you have put him in a brown paper bag and set him on fire? \nScene: Howard\u2019s bedroom. Howard is in bed, Sheldon is on a blow up mattress on the floor.\nSheldon: I\u2019ve never slept on an air mattress before. No lumbar support whatsoever. \nHoward: Maybe you\u2019d be happier on a park bench? \nSheldon: I don\u2019t see any way to get a park bench in here.\nHoward: Do you want to switch?\nSheldon: No, that\u2019s fine. I\u2019m perfectly comfortable sleeping on a bouncy castle. \nHoward: Get out of bed, we\u2019re switching.\nSheldon: Now, only if you want to.\nHoward: Just get in the bed!\nHoward\u2019s mother (off): What\u2019s going on? Are you boys roughhousing? \nHoward: We\u2019re just talking ma. \nHoward\u2019s mother: If you don\u2019t settle down right now, I\u2019m not going to let you have any more sleepovers. \nHoward: For God\u2019s sake, ma, I\u2019m 27 years old. It\u2019s not even a school night! (To Sheldon) Comfy now?\nSheldon: Meh. That poster of Halle Berry\u2019s a little unnerving. \nHoward: So don\u2019t look at it.\nSheldon: She\u2019s like my fourth favourite catwoman.\nHoward: No kidding?\nSheldon: Yeah, Julie Newmar, Michelle Pfieffer, Eartha Kitt and then her. \nHoward: What about Lee Meriwether?\nSheldon: Oh, I forgot about Lee Meriwether.\nHoward: Well I\u2019m glad that\u2019s settled. \nSheldon: That makes Halle Berry my fifth favourite catwoman. There\u2019s Julie Newmar, Michelle Pfieffer, Eartha Kitt, Lee Meriwether\u2026\nHoward: Please, I\u2019m begging you, go to sleep.\nSheldon: I\u2019m trying, I\u2019m counting catwomen. She did make a fine mutant in the X-Men movies though.\nHoward: Oh for God\u2019s sake.\nSheldon: But she\u2019s not my favourite of the X-Men, in order that would be Wolverine, Cyclops, oh wait, I forgot Professor X. Professor X, Wolverine, Cyclops, Iceman, then Storm, Angel, the Beast, oh wait, Nightcrawler. Professor X, Nightcrawler, Wolverine, Cyclops, Iceman, then Storm, Angel\u2026.\nScene: Sheldon and Leonard\u2019s apartment. There is an urgent rapping at the door.\nLeonard: I\u2019m coming! (Opens the door. Sheldon falls inside, wearing his pyjamas. Howard is outside.)\nSheldon: Hey, there he is, there\u2019s my old buddy-bud-bud. \nLeonard: What\u2019s with him?\nHoward: Koothrappali dumped him on me, and he couldn\u2019t get to sleep, so I gave him a glass of warm milk with a handful of my mom\u2019s valium in it. But he still wouldn\u2019t shut up, so, tag, you\u2019re it. \nSheldon: I\u2019m ba-ack!\nLeonard: I still don\u2019t know why you left.\nSheldon: I can\u2019t tell you.\nLeonard: Why not.\nSheldon: I promised Penny. \nLeonard: You promised Penny what? \nSheldon: That I wouldn\u2019t tell you the secret. Shhhhh!\nLeonard: What secret. Tell me the secret. \nSheldon: Mom smokes in the car. Jesus is okay with it, but we can\u2019t tell Dad. \nLeonard: Not that secret, the other secret.\nSheldon: I\u2019m Batman. Shhhhh!\nLeonard: Dammit, Sheldon! You said Penny told you a secret, what was the secret.\nSheldon: Okay, I\u2019ll tell you, but you can\u2019t tell Leonard. \nLeonard: I promise. \nSheldon: Penny lied about graduating from community college because she is afraid she\u2019s not smart enough for Leonard. \nLeonard: So it\u2019s nothing I did? It\u2019s her problem? \nSheldon: I drank milk that tasted funny. \nLeonard: Penny thinks I\u2019m too smart for her, that\u2019s ridiculous. \nSheldon: I know, most of your work is extremely derivative. Don\u2019t worry, that\u2019s not a secret. Everybody knows. \nScene: The hallway. Leonard is outside Penny\u2019s door.\nPenny (opening door): Hi.\nLeonard: Yeah, hi, listen, I know what\u2019s been bothering you about us, and I have the answer. \nPenny: What are you talking about.\nLeonard: First I want to say that it\u2019s not Sheldon\u2019s fault, he tried very hard to keep your secret, if Howard hadn\u2019t drugged him he would have taken it to his grave. \nPenny: He told you?\nLeonard: Yes, but it\u2019s okay. Now that we know what the problem is, there\u2019s a simple solution. (Hands her a brochure.) \nPenny: Pasadena city college? \nLeonard: A place for fun, a place for knowledge. See, this man here\u2019s playing hacky sack, and this girl\u2019s going to be a paralegal. \nPenny: Wow, I get it, because Dr Leonard Hofstadter can\u2019t date a girl without a fancy college degree. \nLeonard: Well, it\u2019s really not that fancy, it\u2019s just a city college. \nPenny: Right, but I have to have some sort of degree to date you? \nLeonard: That doesn\u2019t matter to me at all.\nPenny: So, it\u2019s fine with you if I\u2019m not smart. \nLeonard: Absolutely. (She slams the door in his face.) Okay, this time I know where I went wrong. (Looking up and seeing the camera) Oh bite me! \nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "2_23": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The apartment. Leonard is working on a whiteboard.\nSheldon: Oh, boy.\nLeonard: What?\nSheldon: I can\u2019t comment without violating our agreement that I don\u2019t criticize your work.\nLeonard: Then what was oh, boy?\nSheldon: Great restraint on my part.\nLeonard: There\u2019s nothing wrong with the science here.\nSheldon: Perhaps you mean a different thing than I do when you say science.\nLeonard (making a change): Okay, how\u2019s that?\nSheldon: You actually had it right in the first place. Once again, you\u2019ve fallen for one of my classic pranks. Bazinga! Well, now here\u2019s a peculiar e-mail. The president of the university wants me to meet him at his office tomorrow morning at 8 a.m.\nLeonard: Why?\nSheldon: It doesn\u2019t say. It must be an emergency. Everyone at the university knows I eat breakfast at eight and move my bowels at 8:20.\nLeonard: Yes, how did we live before Twitter? I guess you\u2019ll find out what it is in the morning.\nSheldon: That\u2019s 14 hours away. For the next 840 minutes, I\u2019m effectively one of Heisenberg\u2019s particles, I know where I am or I know how fast I\u2019m going, but I can\u2019t know both. Yet how am I supposed to carry on with this huge annoying thing hovering over my head?\nLeonard: Yeah, I know the feeling.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: Outside Leonard\u2019s bedroom.\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard. (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard. (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard.\nLeonard: Sheldon, it\u2019s two o\u2019clock in the morning.\nSheldon: Why is everybody keep telling me what time it is?\nLeonard: Everybody?\nSheldon: You, the president of the university, his wife, their sullen teenage daughter. That entire family is fascinated by what time it is and whether people know it.\nLeonard: You went to President Seibert\u2019s house in the middle of the night?\nSheldon: He didn\u2019t respond to my e-mail, his phone number is unlisted. Tell me what my other option was.\nLeonard: You could have waited until morning. I know, look who I\u2019m talking to.\nSheldon: Do you remember the grant proposal I submitted to the National Science Foundation to detect slow-moving monopoles at the magnetic North Pole?\nLeonard: Hardly a day goes by when I don\u2019t think about it.\nSheldon: Aw, how nice. Well, a space opened up at the last minute on the NSF expedition to the Arctic Circle.\nLeonard: Wait a minute. He offered to send you to the North Pole?\nSheldon: Yes. In fact, he was quite enthusiastic. He said, \u201cFrankly, if I could send you tonight, I would.\u201d\nLeonard: Okay, well, do you want to go?\nSheldon: Of course not. I\u2019m a theoretical physicist, a career I chose in no small part because it\u2019s indoors, but if I\u2019m able to detect slow-moving magnetic monopoles there, I will be the scientist to confirm string theory. People will write books about me. Third-graders will create macaroni-art dioramas depicting scenes from my life.\nLeonard: Sure, maybe a tableau of me trying to pummel you to death.\nSheldon: Sarcasm?\nLeonard: Maybe.\nSheldon: I\u2019m on the horns of a dilemma. Can you imagine me, Sheldon Cooper, at the North Pole?\nLeonard: Easy peasy, I\u2019m doing it right now.\nSheldon: I\u2019m not good with cold, Leonard. How often have we had to leave a movie theatre because I got a headache from drinking the Icee too fast? I can\u2019t go.\nLeonard: Well, then don\u2019t go.\nSheldon: How can you say that? The scientific opportunity of a lifetime presents itself and my best friend says don\u2019t go.\nLeonard: All right, then go.\nSheldon: Listen to you. How can I possibly go?\nLeonard: Sheldon, what are the words I can say right now to end this conversation and let me go back to sleep?\nSheldon: Odd, President Seibert posed the exact same question.\nLeonard: How was it resolved?\nSheldon: It wasn\u2019t. His wife set their dogs on me and rendered the question moot.\nScene: The stairwell.\nHoward: Just imagine. If he says yes, we\u2019ll have an entire summer without Sheldon.\nRaj: We could play outside.\nHoward: We could sit on the left side of the couch.\nLeonard: I could use the bathroom at 8:20.\nRaj: Our dreams are very small, aren\u2019t they?\nSheldon: Good news, gentlemen, I have tentatively accepted\u2026\nAll: Yeah! Woo-hoo!\nSheldon: \u2026the invitation to join the Arctic Expedition.\nLeonard: It\u2019s not gonna be the same without you.\nHoward: Godspeed.\nSheldon: Thank you, but your sentiments may be premature.\nRaj: Ooh, I don\u2019t like where this is going.\nSheldon: I would like to propose that the three of you accompany me.\nHoward: To the North Pole?\nSheldon: Yes.\nRaj: Is this just so we won\u2019t touch your stuff while you\u2019re away?\nSheldon: I\u2019ll admit that was a concern. But the fact is, I\u2019ll need a support team. And the three of you are my first choice.\nHoward: Really?\nSheldon: Well, there are others who might be more qualified, but the thought of interviewing them gave me a stomach ache. Now, I know I\u2019m proposing an enormous undertaking, so why don\u2019t you take a few moments to discuss it?\nHoward: We\u2019re not really gonna go to the North Pole with him, are we?\nSheldon (voice): I\u2019m still within earshot! You may want to wait for my door to close.\nHoward: We\u2019re not really gonna go to the North Pole with him, are we?\nLeonard: Hang on. Let\u2019s talk about it. This is a National Science Foundation expedition. I don\u2019t know how we can turn it down.\nHoward: Easy. Instead of saying, no, we don\u2019t want to go on an NSF expedition, say, no, we don\u2019t want to spend \u201cthree months stuck in a cabin in the Arctic Circle with an anal nutbag.\u201d\nRaj: But if we were part of the team that confirmed string theory, we could drink for free in any bar in any college town with a university that has a strong science program.\nLeonard: Howard, this is big science. You could be the engineer who builds the equipment that puts us on the cover of magazines.\nHoward: I could also be the engineer who builds the crossbow that kills Sheldon.\nRaj: You still might get on a magazine.\nHoward: So you guys are seriously considering this?\nLeonard: Yes.\nHoward: And you think you can put up with Sheldon?\nRaj: Well, I\u2019m a Hindu. My religion teaches that if we suffer in this life we are rewarded in the next. Three months at the North Pole with Sheldon and I\u2019m reborn as a well-hung billionaire with wings!\nSheldon: Well, gentlemen, have you reached a decision?\nLeonard: I\u2019m in.\nRaj: Me, too.\nHoward: Oh, damn it. Peer pressure. Fine.\nSheldon: Excellent. And just an FYI, as I am the expedition\u2019s team leader, protocol dictates that be phrased fine, sir. But don\u2019t worry, there will be a briefing.\nScene: Outside Penny\u2019s door.\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Penny.\nPenny: (Knock, knock, knock) Sheldon. \n \nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Penny.\nPenny: (Knock, knock, knock) Sheldon. \n \nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Penny.\nPenny: (Knock, knock, knock) Sheldon. \n \nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Penny.\nPenny: (Knock, knock, knock) Sheldon. \n \nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Penny.\nPenny: (Knock, knock, knock) Sheldon. \n \nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Penny.\nPenny: (Knock, knock, knock) Sheldon. \n \nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Penny.\nPenny: What do you want?\nSheldon: I need access to the Cheesecake Factory\u2019s walk-in freezer.\nPenny: Now, honey, I already told you, the hamburger meat is fresh and stored at a safe temperature.\nSheldon: No. This is to train for a three-month expedition to the magnetic North Pole.\nPenny: What?\nSheldon: I don\u2019t know how that sentence could possibly confuse you, but to elaborate, I\u2019m going to the Arctic Circle with Leonard, Wolowitz and Koothrappali.\nPenny: You\u2019re all going?\nSheldon: Yes.\nPenny: For three months?\nSheldon: Yes.\nPenny: Excuse me.\nSheldon: Is that a yes or a no on the freezer? The woman has the attention span of a gnat.\nPenny: Hey, Leonard.\nLeonard: Hi.\nPenny: Sheldon says you\u2019re going to the North Pole.\nLeonard: Yeah. Pretty cool, huh?\nPenny: Yeah. I\u2019m just a little surprised you didn\u2019t tell me.\nLeonard: Oh, well, it all happened kind of fast, and we had to get physicals and buy thermal underwear and study up on, you know, snow and stuff. Sorry, I was gonna tell you.\nPenny: Oh, hey, no, you don\u2019t have to apologize. There\u2019s no reason you have to tell me. I was just, you know, surprised.\nSheldon: Yes, yes, you were busy, you were surprised, all very fascinating. Now where do we stand on the freezer?\nPenny: Is he serious?\nLeonard: Actually, it would help.\nPenny: All right, I\u2019ll see what I can do. So, three months at the North Pole. Wow, that is awesome.\nLeonard: Yeah.\nSheldon: I\u2019m sorry, but at what point do you put this see what you can do plan into action?\nPenny: Just a warning, Sheldon, the freezer locks from the outside.\nLeonard: Did she seem upset to you?\nSheldon: No. Did she seem upset to you?\nLeonard: No.\nSheldon: Oh, good, I got it right. Are you upset?\nLeonard: A little bit.\nSheldon: Two for two. I\u2019m on fire.\nLeonard: I mean, I know she\u2019s not my girlfriend or anything, but wouldn\u2019t you think she\u2019d feel a little bad that I\u2019m going to be gone for the whole summer?\nSheldon: That feels like a bonus question. I\u2019m going to stop here while I\u2019m ahead, but I\u2019ve had a great time.\nScene: Inside the cheesecake factory freezer.\n \nSheldon: Alright, now the purpose of this drill is to acclimate us to the use of tools in extreme temperatures such as we will face in the Arctic Circle.\nRaj: Where are your tools?\nSheldon (pointing at his brain): Right here. All right, team, open up your practice kits. As the university did not permit me to bring the actual equipment we\u2019ll be using to the Cheesecake Factory, because apparently I\u2019m \u201cridiculous,\u201d I\u2019ve provided substitutes which will exercise your fine motor skills. Leonard, you will be doing a series of complex mathematical problems on a vintage Casio model 1175 calculator watch I received when I won the Earth Science medal in 3rd grade. Treat it with respect. Raj, you will be painting sideburns and a Van Dyke on a six-inch figurine of Legolas the elf. Now, remember, a Van Dyke is a goatee without a moustache. Wolowitz, you will be completing a series of delicate surgical procedures on the classic children\u2019s game, Operation. To begin with, you will remove funny bone for two hundred dollars.\nHoward: For this I went to MIT.\nSheldon: And begin.\nRaj: I think I swallowed some paint!\nLeonard: I can\u2019t press any of the buttons with my gloves. Oh, son of a bitch!\nSheldon: Adversity is to be expected. Continue.\nHoward: Oh, boy, am I gonna get sued.\nLeonard: Okay, I can\u2019t do this.\nRaj: Me either.\nSheldon: Gentlemen, use your imagination. Innovate. Did Han Solo let Luke Skywalker freeze to death on the ice planet of Hoth? No. He cut open a tauntaun and used its internal body heat to warm him up.\nHoward: You heard the man. Hold him down and I\u2019ll cut him open.\nLeonard: Hang on, I know I don\u2019t possess the tools of leadership, but I don\u2019t understand why we can\u2019t assemble the equipment inside the hut and then take it outside.\nSheldon: I hadn\u2019t thought of that. I guess we\u2019re done here.\nScene: The apartment kitchen.\n \nSheldon: Here, drink slash eat this.\nLeonard: What is it?\nSheldon: It\u2019s hot chocolate with a stick of butter.\nHoward: Okay, why?\nSheldon: Because in the frigid temperatures in the Arctic, we need to consume at least 5,000 calories a day just to maintain our body weight.\nLeonard: Sheldon, you know I can\u2019t eat butter. I\u2019m lactose intolerant.\nSheldon: Way ahead of you, that\u2019s an \u201cI Can\u2019t Believe It\u2019s Not Butter\u201d stick.\nRaj (on his webcam): But mummy, all the other guys are going to the North Pole.\nMrs Koothrappali: I don\u2019t care what the other guys are doing. If the other guys jumped in the Bay of Bengal and tried to swim to Sri Lanka, would you follow them?\nRaj: If you were standing behind me nagging, I might.\nDr Koothrappali: Don\u2019t talk back to your mother. This trip is much too dangerous, Rajesh.\nRaj: No, it\u2019s not. Howard, tell them.\nHoward: Doctor and Mrs. Koothrappali, namaste. I understand your concern, but if it\u2019ll make you feel any better, my mother is fine with me going, and this is a woman who kept a safety rail on my bed until I was 17.\nMrs Koothrappali: So, she has no problem with her son being eaten by a walrus?\nSheldon: That\u2019s very unlikely, Mrs. Koothrappali. If Raj dies, it\u2019ll be from frostbite, gangrene, acute sunburn or being ripped to shreds by a fifteen hundred pound polar bear.\nHoward: Ma, I\u2019m putting you on speakerphone with Raj\u2019s parents. Can you tell them that you\u2019re okay with me going to the Arctic?\nHoward\u2019s Mother: Arctic? I thought you said Arkansas!\nHoward: I didn\u2019t say that. You never listen to me!\nHoward\u2019s Mother: He doesn\u2019t tell me anything! He lives a secret life because he\u2019s ashamed!\nPenny (arriving): Hey, Leonard, can I talk to you for a sec?\nLeonard: Sure, but let\u2019s go out here where there\u2019s a little less yelling and guilt. What\u2019s up?\nPenny: Well, I got you a little going away present.\nLeonard: Oh, a blanket.\nPenny: Oh, no, no, no, not just a blanket. See, it has sleeves. Yeah! \u00a0So, you can, you know, be all snoodled up while you do your science stuff.\nLeonard: Oh, wow, cool.\nPenny: Oh, I\u2019m gonna miss you. (She hugs him for a long time) See you later.\nLeonard: Bye.  \nMrs Koothrappali: I told you no. Why don\u2019t you believe me?\nHoward\u2019s Mother: \u2018Cause it doesn\u2019t make sense to me! How can it be that in the entire country of India, there isn\u2019t one Outback Steakhouse?!\nScene: Sheldon\u2019s bedroom. Sheldon is asleep. There is a knock on the door.\nLeonard: Sheldon, Sheldon?\nSheldon: I want a cookie, Meemaw.\nLeonard: Sheldon, it\u2019s me.\nSheldon: But Meemaw just made cookies.\nLeonard: Listen, I don\u2019t know if I can go on the expedition.\nSheldon: What?\nLeonard: I don\u2019t think I can go to the North Pole.\nSheldon: Okay, Leonard, I know you\u2019re concerned about disappointing me but I want you to take comfort from the knowledge that my expectations of you are very low.\nLeonard: Yeah, that\u2019s very comforting.\nSheldon: Comforting is a part of leadership. It\u2019s not a part I care for, but such is my burden.\nLeonard: Terrific, it\u2019s just that I don\u2019t think Penny wants me to go.\nSheldon: Assuming that\u2019s a valid reason not to go, which it isn\u2019t, how do you know this? Did she say it?\nLeonard: Not exactly. But she said she was gonna miss me and she gave me this.\nSheldon: What is it?\nLeonard: It\u2019s a blanket with sleeves.\nSheldon: Oh, that\u2019s clever. Let me see if I understand this correctly. Her missing you is an emotional state you find desirable?\nLeonard: Yes, obviously.\nSheldon: All right. Well, given that missing you is predicated on you leaving, logic dictates you must leave.\nLeonard: Yes, okay, but I\u2019m gonna be gone for three months. What if she doesn\u2019t miss me that long and she meets someone else?\nSheldon: She does have a short attention span.\nLeonard: So, I can\u2019t go.\nSheldon: Leonard, you may be right. It appears that Penny secretly wants you in her life in a very intimate and carnal fashion.\nLeonard: You really think so?\nSheldon: Of course not. Even in my sleep-deprived state, I\u2019ve managed to pull off another one of my classic pranks. Bazinga!\nScene: Outside Penny\u2019s door. Leonard is knocking.\nPenny: Oh, Leonard, what time is it?\nLeonard: It\u2019s 7 a.m. I\u2019m sorry it\u2019s early, but we\u2019re leaving soon, and I needed to talk to you.\nPenny: Okay.\nLeonard: What did you mean when you said you\u2019re going to miss me?\nPenny: Um, I don\u2019t know. You\u2019ll be gone and I\u2019ll notice.\nLeonard (indicating the blanket): Okay, well, um, what about this? What does this mean?\nPenny: Wine, credit card and late night television are a bad combination.\nLeonard: All right, fine. What about that really long hug? What did that mean?\nPenny: That wasn\u2019t a long hug.\nLeonard: It was at least five Mississippis. A standard hug is two Mississippis tops.\nPenny: Leonard, I don\u2019t know what to tell you. It was just a hug.\nLeonard: Glad we cleared that up.\nPenny: Yeah.\nLeonard: I guess I\u2019ll see you.\nPenny: Okay, have a safe trip.\nLeonard: Thank you. Bye.\nPenny: Okay, bye. (Penny closes door. To herself) Means I wish you weren\u2019t going.\nScene: The North Pole.\nLeonard: Damn it.\nHoward: What?\nLeonard: We\u2019re out of ice.\nSheldon: All right, men, we begin initial assembly and deployment of the testing equipment starting tomorrow at 0700 hours, but until then, you are all off duty. I suggest you keep the shenanigans to a minimum as medical help is 18 hours away by dogsled.\nRaj: What are you working on?\nHoward: Crossbow.\nLeonard: Hey, guys, can I just say something? How about we take a moment to think about where we are right now? This is literally the top of the world. Only a handful of people in all of human history will ever see what we are going to see.\nRaj: He\u2019s right.\nHoward: Yeah, wow.\nSheldon: It is remarkable.\nRaj: So, who\u2019s up for a movie?\nHoward: Good idea, what do you think? Ice Station Zebra or John Carpenter\u2019s The Thing?\nRaj: I say double feature.\nLeonard: Dinner\u2019s ready!\nSheldon: What are we having?\nLeonard: Reconstituted Thai food.\nSheldon: Did you bring the dehydrated low-sodium soy sauce?\nLeonard: Check.\nSheldon: Freeze-dried spicy mustard?\nLeonard: Check.\nSheldon: Flash-frozen brown rice, not white?\nLeonard: Uh, oh, sorry.\nSheldon: Not to worry. I hid it. Bazinga! You\u2019re in my spot.\nHoward: There\u2019s no time for a crossbow. Find me an icicle.\nSheldon: Three months. This is gonna be great!\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "3_21": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The university cafeteria.\nSheldon: Hold.\nRaj: What?\nSheldon: Explain your sneeze.\nRaj: I\u2019m sorry?\nSheldon: Do you have allergies?\nRaj: No.\nSheldon: Is there too much pepper on your salad?\nRaj: I don\u2019t put pepper on salads.\nSheldon: I\u2019ve heard enough. Sit over there.\nRaj: Oh, come on. I don\u2019t want to sit by myself.\nSheldon: That\u2019s what Typhoid Mary said, and clearly, her friends buckled.\nRaj: Guys, help me.\nHoward: Sheldon, come on.\nLeonard: Yeah, it\u2019s just one sneeze. (Raj sneezes) You\u2019re on your own.\nHoward: See you, buddy.\nSheldon: Oh, Leonard, I have something for you. Per our roommate agreement, this is your 24-hour notice that I will be having a non-related female spending two nights in our apartment.\nLeonard: When you say non-related female, you still mean human, right?\nSheldon: Of course. Pets are banned under the roommate agreement, with the exception of service animals, such as seeing eye dogs and, one day, cybernetically-enhanced helper monkeys.\nHoward: Are you planning on kidnapping a woman?\nSheldon: Sarcasm?\nHoward: Yes, but mixed with genuine concern.\nSheldon: For your information, I\u2019ll be playing host to Dr. Elizabeth Plimpton.\nRaj: The cosmological physicist from Princeton?\nSheldon: Yes. And until you acquire a surgical mask, please address your comments to me through a napkin. We\u2019ve been corresponding for years about our mutual interest in gravitational wave signatures of inflatons in the early universe. And now she\u2019s under consideration for a position at our university.\nLeonard: Why didn\u2019t you tell me you knew Elizabeth Plimpton? I am a huge fan of hers!\nSheldon: I didn\u2019t realize I was obligated to share my connection with things you\u2019re a fan of, but very well. You enjoy Canadian bacon. I\u2019ve been to Toronto.\nLeonard: Okay, fine. Where is she going to sleep?\nSheldon: My room, of course.\nRaj: Holy crap! (Through napkin) Holy crap!\nHoward: Yeah, um, I have a two-part question.\nSheldon: Go ahead.\nHoward: A, are you kidding me? And B, seriously, are you freaking kidding me?\nSheldon: A, I rarely kid. And B, when I do kid, you will know it by my use of the word bazinga.\nHoward: So you\u2019re saying the two of you are going to be sleeping in the same bed?\nSheldon: Yes. Bazinga. Leonard?\nLeonard: Thank you. Why is a world-renowned scientist staying in our apartment instead of a hotel?\nSheldon: Well, she doesn\u2019t care for hotels. And who can blame her? Windows that don\u2019t open, multi-user linens, keys shaped like credit cards, as if one walks around with unassigned slots in one\u2019s wallet. All right, I believe I have time for one more question. Yes, Raj?\nRaj: When can I sit with you again?\nSheldon: When I\u2019ve seen two consecutive negative throat cultures spaced 12 hours apart. You know the drill. All right, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I am off to start a prophylactic course of antibiotics.\nLeonard: I can\u2019t believe he\u2019s friends with Elizabeth Plimpton.\nRaj: I can\u2019t believe they let him into Canada.\nHoward: Whoa, whoa, whoa. You heard the man. Where\u2019s your throat cultures? Kidding. Sit down.\nCredits sequence\n \nScene: The lobby\nPenny: Hey, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Oh, Penny, excellent. I have a question about these maxi pads. Are the wings truly functional or have I fallen victim to marketing hype?\nPenny: What? What are you doing with, what?\nSheldon: The stock boy at Walgreens was frustratingly uninformed on the subject.\nPenny: Sheldon, what are you doing with maxi pads?\nSheldon: I have a lady friend who will be staying with me for a few days.\nPenny: Oh. What?\nSheldon: I want her to feel at home. I also bought scented soaps, pantyhose, Midol, calcium chews and what is apparently a yogurt specifically designed to regulate the female bowel.\nPenny: Wait, wait, hold on, back up. You\u2019re having a woman stay with you?\nSheldon: Yes. Why does that seem to flabbergast everybody?\nPenny: Oh, no, no, no, no. I\u2019m not flabbergasted. I\u2019m puzzled. Yeah, let\u2019s go with puzzled.\nSheldon: A word of warning. My guest is a noted physicist and the leading expert on quantum cosmology, so please try to avoid wasting her time with female jibber jabber.\nPenny: Female jibber jabber?\nSheldon: Shoe sales, hair styles, mud masks, gossip about your friends Brad and Angelina.\nPenny: Oh, they\u2019re not my friends.\nSheldon: I\u2019m not surprised, considering the way you talk about them behind their backs.\nScene: The apartment. \nLeonard: She\u2019s here, she\u2019s here. How do I look? Do I look smart?\nSheldon: Oh, good grief. This isn\u2019t about you. Coming! Now listen, one of the great minds of the 21st century is about to play host to one of the other great minds of the 21st century. So pay attention. Years from now, my biographer might ask you about this event.\nLeonard: Oh, I have so many things to tell your biographer.\nElizabeth: Ah, Dr. Cooper, thank goodness. I completely forgot your address. But then I remembered that I\u2019d written it on my hand. Lucky for me, I didn\u2019t confuse it with what I\u2019d written on my other hand, which are the coordinates for a newly discovered neutron star. \u2018Cause if I tried to go there, I\u2019d be crushed by hypergravity. Anyway, hello.\nSheldon: Hello.\nElizabeth: Nice to finally meet you in person.\nSheldon: I would imagine it is. This is my friend and roommate, Dr. Leonard Hofstadter.\nLeonard: Hi-lo. Oops. I started to say hi, and then I switched to hello in the middle. It came out hi-lo. Duh. Uh, it\u2019s nice to meet you. I\u2019ve read both your books and most of your papers. I\u2019m Leonard, I live\nhere, you\u2019re brilliant.\nSheldon: I apologize. He\u2019s only an experimental physicist.\nElizabeth: No need to apologize. Some of my best friends are experimental physicists. Well, not my best friends, but I know them. My best friend is a molecular chemist named Wendy. I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m rambling. Hi-lo.\nLeonard: Are you hungry, thirsty? Can I offer you anything?\nSheldon: No, she\u2019s my guest. If anyone should offer her anything, it should be me. Elizabeth, can I get you something? Perhaps a feminine hygiene product or a bowel-regulating yogurt?\nElizabeth: Interesting choices. Based on my current needs, I guess I\u2019d pick the yogurt.\nSheldon: Excellent. If the yogurt works, I bought some delightful scented candles.\nLeonard: Look, it\u2019s you.\nScene: A little later.\nElizabeth: Thank you so much for opening up your home to me.\nLeonard: Well, who wants to stay in a hotel? With windows that don\u2019t open, those crazy card-shaped keys.\nElizabeth: I\u2019m so glad you understand.\nSheldon: No, he doesn\u2019t understand. I understand.\nLeonard: Well, I understand, too.\nSheldon: You\u2019re just misappropriating my understanding.\nLeonard: Oh, (blows a raspberry). I think any university would want you. Except, of course, any university that had already had you. Because they would\u2019ve already wanted you before they, you know, got you.\nSheldon: From the mind that brought you hi-lo. Let me show you to your room.\nElizabeth: All right. I guess I am tired. Good night, Leonard.\nLeonard: Uh, sleep night. I mean, obviously, good night. I started to say sleep tight, then I changed my mind in the middle. I swear to God, I\u2019m smart.\nSheldon: Get it together, man.\nScene: Sheldon\u2019s bedroom. \nSheldon: All right, let me show you some of the features of the room. First, windows. Conventional. Open, closed, open, closed, halfway open, or halfway closed, depending on your philosophical bent. Over here is my comic book collection. Feel free to browse. There\u2019s a box of disposable reading gloves on the night stand.\nElizabeth: Good to know.\nSheldon: In here, you\u2019ll find emergency provisions. An eight-day supply of food and water, a crossbow, season two of Star Trek: The Original Series on a high-density flash drive.\nElizabeth: What if there\u2019s a disaster that destroys all the USB ports?\nSheldon: Then there\u2019s really no reason to live, is there?\nElizabeth: Can I ask a question about your roommate?\nSheldon: He\u2019s an odd duck, isn\u2019t he?\nElizabeth: What\u2019s his relationship status?\nSheldon: Well, there was a misbegotten adventure with a waitress who lives across the hall. It ended as inexplicably as it began. They had very little in common, except for carnal activity. That\u2019s why I acquired these noise-cancelling headphones. If you decide to use them, please clean the ear pieces afterwards with the Wet Wipes you\u2019ll find in the bathroom. They\u2019re in the drawer labelled Wet Wipes.\nElizabeth: Okay.\nSheldon: Good. I\u2019ll leave you to your night time ablutions. I\u2019ve e-mailed you the morning bathroom schedule. You\u2019ll also find a laminated copy in your welcome packet. It\u2019s on the back of the emergency escape route diagram.\nElizabeth: How thoughtful.\nSheldon: Sleep well, my friend.\nElizabeth: You, too.\nSheldon: Oh, let me just get one thing. It\u2019s my backup emergency supply kit. The living room escape route doesn\u2019t pass through here. Now, good night. And if there\u2019s an apocalypse, good luck.\nScene: Leonard\u2019s bedroom. There is a knock on the door.\nLeonard: Yes?\nElizabeth: I saw your light on.\nLeonard: Is everything all right?\nElizabeth: Yeah, I just couldn\u2019t sleep.\nLeonard: Me neither. Oh, look what I\u2019m reading. It\u2019s you.\nElizabeth: I thought you already read it.\nLeonard: I did, but it\u2019s been a while, and I wanted to sound smart over breakfast.\nElizabeth: Aw, you\u2019re smart.\nLeonard: Oh, good. Wasn\u2019t sure it was coming across.\nElizabeth: What chapter are you on?\nLeonard: Uh, six.\nElizabeth: Oh, the extragalactic distance ladder. Want to know a little secret?\nLeonard: Sure.\nElizabeth: I wrote the section on the Wilson-Bappu Effect completely naked.\nLeonard: Really? Uh, sure doesn\u2019t read that way.\nElizabeth: Here, let me show you. When we consider the brightness of pulsating variable stars, we start to see (removes robe) a possible explanation for some of the discrepancies found in Hubble\u2019s constant.\nLeonard: Wow. You really make science come alive.\nScene: The living room.\nSheldon: Vocal test. Morning vocal test. Second vocal test. Second morning vocal test.\nLeonard: Morning, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Morning.\nElizabeth: Morning, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Morning. I trust you had a pleasant night.\nElizabeth: More than pleasant.\nSheldon: Excuse me, I\u2019m going to relieve myself.\nLeonard: How do you take your coffee?\nElizabeth: Black.\nLeonard: Okeydoke.\nSheldon (in bathroom): Pee for Houston, pee for Austin, pee for the state my heart got lost in. And shake twice for Texas.\nLeonard: Something his mother taught him.\nSheldon: All right, Elizabeth, the bathroom is yours. The seat is down, and has been sanitized for your protection.\nElizabeth: That\u2019s very thoughtful, but I think I\u2019ll finish my coffee first.\nSheldon: Ah, so the yogurt didn\u2019t work. I\u2019ll fire off a critical e-mail to the manufacturer.\nPenny: Oh, good, you\u2019re up. Look, my car won\u2019t start. I need a ride to work.\nSheldon: Did you once again ignore your check engine light?\nPenny: No, Mr. smarty-pants. I ignored the fill gas tank light.\nSheldon: Leonard, Penny wants to exploit any residual feelings you have for her in order to get a ride to work.\nLeonard: Oh, yeah, sure, let me just put this in a travel mug.\nPenny: Hello.\nElizabeth: Hi.\nPenny: Oh, Penny, this is Dr. Plimpton, a leading expert on quantum cosmology. Dr. Plimpton, Penny is a waitress who doesn\u2019t understand the role gasoline plays in the internal combustion engine.\nElizabeth: Nice to meet you.\nPenny: Nice to meet you, too. Are you enjoying your stay?\nElizabeth: Yes, very much.\nPenny: Good.\nSheldon: Wonderful. Meaningless pleasantries accomplished. Elizabeth, Leonard\u2019s bathroom time is coming up, and believe me, you do not want to follow him.\nElizabeth: Excuse me.\nLeonard: Okay, well, I guess I should get dressed so I can take everyone to work. You and Sheldon and Sheldon\u2019s friend, Dr. Plimpton, who you just met. It\u2019ll be fun. Like a clown car.\nPenny: Hang on.\nLeonard: Hmm? Yeah? What? Huh?\nPenny: We just broke up.\nLeonard: What, uh, you and me? Yeah, we did. Not too long ago. How are you doing with it?\nPenny: Not as good as you apparently.\nLeonard: I, um, I don\u2019t follow.\nPenny: You know what? It\u2019s, it\u2019s none of my business. If you want to sleep with Sheldon\u2019s doctor buddy right after we stopped seeing each other, go for it.\nLeonard: Well, now\u2026\nSheldon: Excuse me. I\u2019m uncomfortable with you recommending that Leonard pursue having intercourse with Dr. Plimpton, who I assure you has better things to do.\nPenny: I\u2019m not recommending it. I\u2019m saying it already happened.\nSheldon: That\u2019s preposterous. Tell her, Leonard.\nLeonard: Well\u2026\nSheldon: No.\nLeonard: Come on. It wasn\u2019t my fault.\nSheldon: The implication being that you somehow tripped and fell into her lady parts?\nPenny: You know what? I\u2019m just gonna take the bus to work.\nLeonard: Penny, I can still drive you.\nPenny: Oh, no, no, it\u2019s okay. You might slip on a banana peel and get me pregnant.\nSheldon: I must say, I\u2019m shocked by this betrayal.\nLeonard: I didn\u2019t betray Penny.\nSheldon: Not Penny, me!\nLeonard: How am I betraying you?\nSheldon: Elizabeth\u2019s my friend, and you\u2019re playing with her!\nLeonard: Yeah, I guess I did.\nScene: The cafeteria. Raj drinks from a hip flask.\nHoward: What the hell are you doing?\nRaj: Relax, it\u2019s Nyquil.\nLeonard: You still have a cold?\nRaj: Maybe, but I don\u2019t care. That\u2019s the great thing about Nyquil, it\u2019s like ten-percent booze. I call it the nighttime sniffling, sneezing, coughing, so you can talk to girls medicine.\nLeonard: Are you having trouble sleeping? \u2018Cause, boy, I was up all night.\nRaj: Did you get a cold, too?\nLeonard: No, but I was awake all night.\nHoward: If you want, I can give you some of my mom\u2019s sleeping pills.\nRaj: She won\u2019t notice they\u2019re missing?\nHoward: She doesn\u2019t know she takes them.\nLeonard: No, that\u2019s okay. It was something else keeping me up last night. And again this morning. And, I didn\u2019t mind. I was up last night. I was up this morning. I didn\u2019t mind. Those are your clues.\nRaj: Ooh, ooh. Did the pigeon on your windowsill have more babies?\nLeonard: No.\nHoward: Were you up making another stop-motion Lego movie?\nLeonard: No.\nHoward: \u2018Cause let me tell you, it\u2019s not enough to make the Legos move, they also have to capture your heart.\nLeonard: Okay, I\u2019ll give you one more clue. It involved another person.\nRaj: Did you get a Japanese love pillow?\nHoward: How is a Japanese love pillow another person?\nRaj: It is if you love her and give her a name.\nSheldon: Dr. Plimpton, I\u2019d like you to meet my colleagues, Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali\nRaj: Hi.\nSheldon: And not-a-doctor Howard Wolowitz.\nHoward: Hi.\nRaj: I\u2019m a big fan of your work.\nElizabeth: Thank you.\nSheldon: And of course, you\u2019ve already introduced yourself to Dr. Hofstadter.\nLeonard: Hey, you.\nElizabeth: Hey, you.\nLeonard: Boy, I\u2019m kind of tuckered out. How are you feeling, Elizabeth?\nElizabeth: You know what? I am a little tired. Would you be a dear and get me a cup of coffee?\nLeonard: Sure. Black, right?\nElizabeth: Actually, now I think I want it hot, brown and sweet.\nLeonard: Coming right up.\nScene: Raj\u2019s apartment.\nRaj: What?\nHoward: What do you mean what? It\u2019s Halo night.\nRaj: I can\u2019t. I\u2019m too sick. Go away.\nHoward: That\u2019s why we moved Halo night here. Look, I brought my mom\u2019s chicken soup.\nRaj: I\u2019m not hungry.\nElizabeth: Don\u2019t send him away. Let him in.\nHoward: Who\u2019s that\nRaj: I bought a parrot.\nHoward: Yeah, right. Dr. Plimpton?\nElizabeth: Hi. Howard, right?\nHoward: Uh, yeah.\nElizabeth: Can I ask you a question, Howard? Do you like role-playing games?\nHoward: Yeah, sure. In fact, I\u2019m a dungeon master.\nElizabeth: Not tonight. Tonight you are a delivery man. You brought soup, but uh-oh, Raj and I don\u2019t have enough money to pay you. So we\u2019ll have to come to some other kind of arrangement.\nHoward: Beg pardon?\nElizabeth: You two figure out the details, I\u2019m going to go change into something I don\u2019t mind getting ripped off my milky flesh.\nHoward: What the frak?\nRaj: Go away. She wants New Delhi, not Kosher deli. Besides, you have a girlfriend.\nHoward: We broke up weeks ago.\nRaj: Why didn\u2019t you say anything?\nHoward: I was waiting for the right time. This is the right time.\nLeonard: Hey, who\u2019s ready for Halo?\nRaj: Oh, this is like a nightmare. Get lost!\nHoward: He\u2019s right. The numbers are shaky enough as it is.\nLeonard: I don\u2019t understand.\nElizabeth: Oh, good. Leonard\u2019s here.\nRaj: Good?\nLeonard: Elizabeth? What\u2019s going on?\nElizabeth: What\u2019s going on is you and Howard are my moving men and Raj is my new landlord and I don\u2019t have enough money to pay any of you.\nLeonard: Is she suggesting what I think she\u2019s suggesting?\nHoward: Yep. Welcome to the Penthouse Forum.\nRaj: Okay, show of hands. Who\u2019s up for this? (Only Howard raises his hand.)\nLeonard: We\u2019ll all be naked in front of each other.\nHoward: I\u2019m out.\nElizabeth: Everybody ready?\nRaj: Follow my lead. Almost. We\u2019re, we\u2019re going to go out into the hallway and, uh, make a dramatic entrance.\nElizabeth: Oh, good. It\u2019s so much better when everyone commits.\nRaj: Run. Run, run, run. Don\u2019t look back.\nLeonard: I thought we had something special.\nRaj (locks door): So, you say you can\u2019t pay your rent?\nScene: The lobby. \nPenny: Oh, Leonard?\nLeonard: Hey.\nPenny: I found these in the dryer. I\u2019m assuming they belong to Sheldon.\nLeonard: Thanks. It\u2019s really hard to find these in his size. So, listen. I\u2019ve been meaning to talk to you about the other morning.\nPenny: You mean you and Dr. Slutbunny?\nLeonard: Yeah, I wanted to explain.\nPenny: Well, you don\u2019t owe me an explanation.\nLeonard: I don\u2019t?\nPenny: No, you don\u2019t.\nLeonard: So you\u2019re not judging me?\nPenny: Oh, I\u2019m judging you nine ways to Sunday, but you don\u2019t owe me an explanation.\nLeonard: Nevertheless, I\u2019d like to get one on the record so you can understand why I did what I did.\nPenny: I\u2019m listening.\nLeonard: She let me.\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "2_11": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The university cafeteria.\nSheldon: Your argument is lacking in all scientific merit. It is well established Superman cleans his uniform by flying into Earth\u2019s yellow sun, which incinerates any contaminate matter and leaves the invulnerable Kryptonian fabric unharmed and daisy fresh.\nHoward: What if he gets something Kryptonian on it?\nSheldon: Like what?\nHoward: I don\u2019t know. Kryptonian mustard.\nSheldon: I think we can safely assume that all Kryptonian condiments were destroyed when the planet Krypton exploded.\nRaj: Or it turned into mustard Kryptonite, the only way to destroy a rogue Kryptonian hotdog threatening Earth.\nLeonard: Raj, please, let\u2019s stay serious here. Superman\u2019s body is Kryptonian, therefore his sweat is Kryptonian.\nHoward: Yeah, what about Kryptonian pit stains?\nSheldon: Superman doesn\u2019t sweat on Earth.\nHoward: Okay, he\u2019s invited for dinner in the Bottle City of Kandor. He miniaturizes himself, enters the city where he loses his superpowers. Now, before dinner, his host says, \u201cwho\u2019s up for a little Kryptonian tetherball?\u201d Superman says \u201csure,\u201d works up a sweat, comes back to Earth, his uniform now stained with indestructible Kryptonian perspiration.\nRaj: Booya.\nSheldon: Superman would have taken his uniform to a Kandorian dry cleaner before he left the Bottle.\nRaj: \u201cKandorian dry cl\u2026\u201d I give up, you can\u2019t have a rational argument with this man.\nHoward: Hey, isn\u2019t that the guy who won the MacArthur genius grant last year? No, not all at once.\nRaj: Then how?\nHoward: Leonard. Now, Raj. Now, Sheldon.\nRaj: I didn\u2019t get a good look. Can I go again?\nHoward: No.\nLeonard: It\u2019s David Underhill. So what?\nSheldon: So what? His observation of high-energy positrons has provided the first conclusive evidence for the existence of galactic dark matter.\nLeonard: I have two words for you. The first is big, the other\u2019s whoop.\nSheldon: It is a big whoop. It made almost all the work you\u2019ve done since you\u2019ve been here completely useless.\nLeonard: Did not.\nHoward: Did, too.\nLeonard: Did\u2026 okay, maybe\u00a0 some of it, but, look, the guy was just in the right place, at the right time with the right paradigm-shifting reinterpretation of the universe. He got lucky.\nRaj: In more ways than one. He\u2019s a very handsome man.\nHoward: Doesn\u2019t do anything for me. If I was gonna go that way, I\u2019m more of a Zac Ephron kinda guy.\nRaj: Oh, yeah, like you have a shot with Zac Ephron.\nDavid (approaching): Excuse me, Are you Leonard Hofstadter?\nLeonard: Uh, yeah.\nDavid: I\u2019m David Underhill.\nLeonard: Uh, y-yeah.\nDavid: Yeah, Dr. Gablehauser said if I wanted to set something up in the photomultiplier lab, that you\u2019d be able to give me a hand?\nLeonard: You want to work with me?\nDavid: Well, if you have a little time, yeah.\nLeonard: Wow, y-yeah, sure. Yeah, no problem. Uh, Here\u2019s my home number, here\u2019s my cell, here\u2019s my office, here\u2019s my parents\u2019 number up in New Jersey, they always know how to reach me. So\u2026\nDavid: Okay.\nLeonard: Congratulations on the MacArthur Grant, by the way. Big fan.\nDavid: Thanks. I\u2019ll call you.\nLeonard: Okay. Bye-bye! What are you looking at?You\u2019ve never seen a hypocrite before?\nCredits sequence.\n\u00a0\nScene: The apartment. The guys are playing Wii bowling.\nRaj: Trailing badly, Wolowitz needs a strike if he has any hopes of catching up with Sheldon Cooper, who is dominating in the ninth frame with a career-best 68.\nLeonard (entering): Hey, guys!\nHoward: That doesn\u2019t count. Do over! Do over!\nSheldon: There are no do-overs in Wii bowling.\nHoward: There are always do-overs when my people play sports.\nSheldon: Where were you that\u2019s more important than Wii bowling night?\nLeonard: Actually, I was\u2026\nSheldon: It\u2019s a rhetorical question. There is nothing more important than Wii bowling night.\nLeonard: Come on, it\u2019s just a video game. And we suck at it.\nSheldon: Nice motivational speech from the team captain.\nHoward: Where were you?\nLeonard: I was working with Dave Underhill.\nHoward: Ooh, \u201cDave.\u201d Sounds like Leonard\u2019s got a new BFF.\nLeonard: Actually, he\u2019s pretty cool. I mean, not only is he a brilliant scientist, but it turns out he\u2019s a Black Diamond skier, he collects vintage motorcycles, he plays in a rock band.\nHoward: So? We\u2019re in a rock band.\nLeonard: No, we play Rock Band on our X-Box.\nSheldon: Nice motivational speech from our lead guitarist.\nLeonard: He\u2019s funny, too. He does this hysterical impersonation of Stephen Hawking having phone sex. What are you wearing? That\u2019s not, he does it better. Anyway, he said he was gonna take me to the gym tomorrow, so I\u2019m gonna go practice my situps.\nRaj: Whoa. Humongous man crush, dude.\nHoward: Yep. It\u2019s officially a bro-mance.\nPenny (entering): Hey, Sheldon, are you and Leonard putting up a Christmas tree?\nSheldon: No, because we don\u2019t celebrate the ancient pagan festival of Saturnalia.\nPenny: Saturnalia?\nHoward: Gather round, kids, it\u2019s time for Sheldon\u2019s beloved Christmas special.\nSheldon: In the pre-Christian era, as the winter solstice approached and the plants died, pagans brought evergreen boughs into their homes as an act of sympathetic magic, intended to guard the life essences of the plants until spring. This custom was later appropriated by Northern Europeans and eventually it becomes the so-called Christmas tree.\nHoward: And that, Charlie Brown, is what boredom is all about.\nPenny: Okay, well, thank you for that, but I got you and Leonard a few silly neighbour gifts, so I\u2019ll just put them under my tree.\nSheldon: Wait! You bought me a present?\nPenny: Uh-huh.\nSheldon: Why would you do such a thing?\nPenny: I don\u2019t know. \u2018Cause it\u2019s Christmas?\nSheldon: Oh, Penny. I know you think you\u2019re being generous, but the foundation of gift-giving is reciprocity. You haven\u2019t given me a gift, you\u2019ve given me an obligation.\nHoward: Don\u2019t feel bad, Penny, it\u2019s a classic rookie mistake. My first Hanukkah with Sheldon, he yelled at me for eight nights.\nPenny: Now, honey, it\u2019s okay.You don\u2019t have to get me anything in return.\nSheldon: Of course I do. The essence of the custom is that I now have to go out and purchase for you a gift of commensurate value and representing the same perceived level of friendship as that represented by the gift you\u2019ve given me. It\u2019s no wonder suicide rates skyrocket this time of year.\nPenny: Okay, you know what? Forget it. I\u2019m not giving you a present.\nSheldon: No, it\u2019s too late. I see it. That elf sticker says to Sheldon. The die has been cast, the moving finger has writ, Hannibal has crossed the Alps.\nHoward (to Raj who is whispering in his ear): I know. It\u2019s funny when it\u2019s not happening to us.\nPenny: Sheldon, I am very, very sorry.\nSheldon: No. No, I brought this on myself by being such an endearing and important part of your life. I\u2019m going to need a ride to the mall.\nHoward: It\u2019s happening to us.\nScene: The stairwell.\nLeonard: Ow! Ow!\nDavid: Are you gonna make it?\nLeonard: Yeah, I guess.\nDavid: All right.\nLeonard: Thanks for letting me try out your motorcycle.\nDavid: No problem.\nLeonard: I had no idea it was so heavy. The thing just fell right over on me, didn\u2019t it?\nDavid: Yeah. Lucky for you it wasn\u2019t moving.\nPenny: Oh, hey, Leonard. Ooh, are you okay?\nLeonard: Oh, yeah. It\u2019s just a little motorcycle accident.\nPenny: My God, how fast were you going?\nLeonard: I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s all such a blur.\nDavid: Ha ha ha. Good one. He couldn\u2019t even get it started. Hi. Dave.\nPenny: Hi. Penny. So it\u2019s your motorcycle?\nDavid: Uh-huh.\nPenny: Oh, is it okay?\nDavid: It\u2019s fine.\nLeonard: Yeah, lucky for the bike it landed on my leg.\nDavid: You mind giving me a hand with speed racer here?\nPenny: Oh, yeah. Yeah, sure. So, um, Dave, how do you know Leonard?\nDavid: I\u2019m a physicist.\nPenny: Ha-ha. No, you\u2019re not.\nDavid: Why is that so surprising?\nPenny: Uh, well, it\u2019s just that the physicists I know are indoorsy and pale.\nLeonard: I\u2019m not indoorsy. I just wear the appropriate sun block because I don\u2019t take melanoma lightly.\nPenny: So, are you and Leonard working on an experiment together?\nDavid: Yeah, actually we are.\nLeonard: Yeah, we\u2019re examining the radiation levels of photomultiplier tubes for a new dark matter detector.\nPenny: Uh, sweetie, sweetie, Dave was talking. You know, I love science.\nLeonard: Since when?\nPenny: Since always. Call me a geek, but I am just nuts for the whole subatomic particle thing.\nDavid: The last thing I would ever call you is a geek.\nPenny: Ha. Well, that\u2019s what I am, queen of the nerds.\nDavid: Well, if you like, I could show you the lab we\u2019re working in. We\u2019ve got some cool toys, you know, lasers and stuff.\nPenny: You know, I have always wanted to see a big science lab.\nLeonard: Since when?\nPenny: Since always.\nDavid: Leonard, are you okay here?\nLeonard: Uh, yeah. I guess.\nDavid: How \u2019bout we go see it now? Maybe afterwards we take the bike up the coast, we grab a little bite to eat\u2026\nPenny: Um,yeah, yeah, that sounds great, let me just get my jacket.\nDavid: Boy, she\u2019ll do, huh?\nLeonard: Yeah, if you like that type.\nDavid: So, you and her?\nLeonard: No, just neighbours.\nDavid: Really. I don\u2019t know how you live next door to that without doing something about it.\nLeonard: Actually, science is my lady.\nPenny: Okay. Let\u2019s go.\nDavid: All right. See you tomorrow, Leonard.\nLeonard: See ya. \u2018Bye, Penny. Have fun. (Bangs head on door. Sheldon opens it.)\nSheldon: Yes? (Leonard falls through) Did you forget your key?\nScene: A gift shop.\n\u00a0\nSheldon: I don\u2019t see anything in here a woman would want.\nHoward: You\u2019re kidding. You\u2019ve got lotions and bath oils and soaps, that\u2019s the estrogen hat trick.\nLeonard: What it is is a cacophonous assault of eucalyptus, bayberry, cinnamon and vanilla. It\u2019s as if my head were trapped in the pyjamas of a sultan.\nRaj: Sheldon, if you don\u2019t like this stuff, let\u2019s just go next door and build her a bear.\nSheldon: I told you before, bears are terrifying.\nHoward: Come on, bath stuff, it\u2019s perfect! You got a scented candle, a cleansing buff, spearmint and green tea scented bath oil, promotes relaxation.\nSheldon: That presupposes Penny is tense.\nRaj: She knows you. She\u2019s tense. We all are. Buy a basket!\nHoward: Excuse me, we\u2019re ready.\nSheldon: No, we\u2019re not. Let\u2019s say for a moment that I accept the bath item gift hypothesis, I now lay the following conundrum at your feet, which size?\nHoward: This one. Let\u2019s go.\nSheldon: You put no thought into that.\nHoward: I\u2019m sorry. Uh, this one. Let\u2019s go!\nSheldon: I have insufficient data to proceed. Excuse me, miss?\nAssistant: Yes?\nSheldon: If I were to give you this gift basket, based on that action alone and no other data, infer and describe the hypothetical relationship that exists between us.\nAssistant: Excuse me?\nSheldon: Here. Now, are we friends? Colleagues? Lovers? Are you my grandmother?\nAssistant: I don\u2019t understand what you\u2019re talking about and you\u2019re making me a little uncomfortable.\nHoward: See? Sounds just like you and Penny. We\u2019ll take it.\nScene: The university cafeteria.\nDavid: Hey, Leonard. Come, join us.\nLeonard: Oh, hey, Dave. And Penny, what a surprise.\nPenny: Hey, Leonard. Dave was just showing me around the university. You know, this place is unbelievable!\nLeonard: Yeah, I know. I\u2019ve been offering to show you around for a year and a half. You always said you had yoga.\nPenny: I never said that.\nLeonard: Maybe I heard you wrong. A lot of words sound like yoga.\nDavid: This is an amazing woman, Leonard. She has a curious and agile mind, not to mention being curious and agile in other respects.\nPenny: Oh, shut up!\nLeonard: Yes, please shut up. So, um, Dave, don\u2019t you think you and I should get back to the lab? You know, that dark matter isn\u2019t going to detect itself.\nDavid: Actually, I was thinking about taking the afternoon off so I could work on another experiment with Penny.\nPenny: Really? We\u2019re going to do an experiment?\nDavid: Uh-huh. We\u2019re going to explore the effects of tequila shots on a gorgeous 22-year-old woman.\nPenny: It\u2019s not an experiment! You saw what happened last night.\nDavid: You ready to go?\nPenny: Yeah. Oh, can I drive the motorcycle?\nDavid: Yeah, why not? You can\u2019t do any worse than Leonard.\nLeonard: That\u2019s funny. By the way, my leg is killing me. Thanks for asking.\nScene: The apartment.\n\u00a0\nSheldon: Mmm, great news, Leonard, I\u2019ve solved my Penny gift dilemma.\nLeonard: Yippee.\nSheldon: You see, the danger was that I might under or over-reciprocate, but I have devised a foolproof plan. See, I will open her gift to me first and then excuse myself, feigning digestive distress.\nThen I\u2019ll look up the price of her gift online, choose the basket closest to that value, give it to her and then I\u2019ll return the others for a full refund.\nLeonard: Brilliant.\nSheldon: It is, isn\u2019t it? Is it okay if I hide them in your room? The smell makes me nauseated.\nLeonard: Do whatever you want.\nSheldon: Thank you, that\u2019s very gracious.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Gentlemen.\nHoward: Why couldn\u2019t you have just done what Leonard did and get Penny a new boyfriend?\nLeonard: My leg is killing me. Thanks for asking.\n\u00a0\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment.\n\u00a0\nLeonard: Okay, I have just one question for you. While I am perfectly happy with the way things are between us, you said that you didn\u2019t want to go out with me because I was too smart for you! Well, news flash, lady, David Underhill is ten times smarter than me! You\u2019d have to drive a railroad spike into his brain for me to beat him at checkers! Next to him, I\u2019m like one of those sign-language gorillas who knows how to ask for grapes! So, my question is, what\u2019s up with that?\nPenny: Why are you yelling at me?\nLeonard: Sorry, I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry! Never mind, we\u2019re cool.\nPenny: Dave is not smarter than you. He\u2019s an idiot.\nLeonard: Really? Why would you say that?\nPenny: Because a smart guy takes the nude photos of his wife off his cell phone before he tries to take nude photos of his girlfriend.\nLeonard: He tried to take nude photos of you?\nPenny: That\u2019s what you took from that? The guy is married!\nLeonard: Oh, yeah. I\u2019m so\u2026 oh, that\u2019s terrible.\nPenny: And you, if you are so okay with the way things are between us, why are you so jealous?\nLeonard: Well, uh, the important thing is he\u2019s married and that\u2019s terrible!\nPenny: Nice save, genius. Eggnog?\nLeonard: Lactose.\nPenny: It\u2019s just rum. It stopped being eggnog like half an hour ago.\nLeonard: Smooth.\nPenny: Smoother than you.\nLeonard: Come on, it\u2019s Christmas, just give me this one.\nPenny: Okay, Merry Christmas.\nLeonard: By the way, my leg is killing me. Thanks for asking.\nScene: The apartment. Leonard opens the door to Penny.\nPenny: Merry Christmas.\nLeonard: Merry Christmas.\nPenny: How\u2019s your leg?\nLeonard: Very good, thanks for asking. Come on in.\nSheldon: Ah, good, Penny, you\u2019re here to exchange gifts. You\u2019ll be pleased to know I\u2019m prepared for whatever you have to offer.\nPenny: Okay, here.\nSheldon: I should note I\u2019m having some digestive distress, so, if I excuse myself abruptly, don\u2019t be alarmed. Oh, a napkin.\nPenny: Turn it over.\nSheldon: To Sheldon, live long and prosper. Leonard Nimoy.\nPenny: Yeah, he came into the restaurant. Sorry the napkin\u2019s dirty. He wiped his mouth with it.\nSheldon: I possess the DNA of Leonard Nimoy?!\nPenny: Well, yeah, yeah, I guess. But look, he signed it.\nSheldon: Do you realize what this means? All I need is a healthy ovum and I can grow my own Leonard Nimoy!\nPenny: Okay, all I\u2019m giving you is the napkin, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Be right back.\nPenny: Here. Open it.\nLeonard: Oh, a gift certificate for motorcycle lessons. Very thoughtful.\nPenny: Yeah, and I checked. Not letting the bike fall on you while standing still is lesson one.\nLeonard: Oh, then, I think you\u2019ll appreciate what I got you.\nPenny: Okay. 101 Totally Cool Science Experiments for Kids.\nLeonard: You know, \u2019cause you\u2019re so into science.\n(Sheldon appears with all the gift baskets)\nPenny: Sheldon! What did you do?!\nSheldon: I know! It\u2019s not enough, is it? Here.\nPenny: Leonard, look! Sheldon\u2019s hugging me.\nLeonard: It\u2019s a Saturnalia miracle.\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "3_13": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: A Chinese restaurant.\nHoward: Boy, seems like forever since the four of us have been out to eat, you know? Just the guys.\nRaj: Oh, God! Yes, we get it. You have a girlfriend now.\nHoward: A little jealous, are we?\nRaj: No, I\u2019m not jealous. All right, I\u2019d kill a hobo if it\u2019ll get me laid. Now, can we order?\nSheldon: Oh, dear Lord, they re-did the menu.\nLeonard: So what? It\u2019s the same food.\nSheldon: Oh, is it? Look at this. General Tso\u2019s Chicken is no longer listed under specialties. It\u2019s now under chicken.\nRaj: So?\nSheldon: Yes, General Tso.\nRaj: Not Tso the chicken, so the question. So?\nSheldon: So, why is it no longer a specialty? Did the chef lose confidence in the dish or himself? And look over here, shrimp in mobster sauce. What is mobster sauce?\nLeonard: It\u2019s obviously a typo.\nSheldon: Perhaps. Perhaps this restaurant\u2019s now a front for organized crime. For all we know, the mobster sauce contains actual chunks of deceased mobsters.\nRaj: No, no, no, no, I think it just means it\u2019s the kind of sauce that mobsters like.\nHoward: It doesn\u2019t mean any of that! It\u2019s a typo.\nLeonard: You know what? Let\u2019s just get a pizza.\nSheldon: Good idea. We\u2019ll go to Corleone\u2019s.\nHoward: Sure, no mobsters there.\nScene: The stairwell.\nSheldon: You know, the more I think about it, the mobster sauce couldn\u2019t possibly contain chunks of mobster.\nLeonard: And why is that?\nSheldon: It was listed under seafood.\nLeonard: What if they were mobsters who slept with the fishes?\nSheldon: Leonard, are we having a serious conversation or not?\nLeonard (noticing their door has been broken open): What the\u2026?\nSheldon: The TV is gone.\nLeonard: So are our laptops.\nSheldon: Oh God, oh God, oh, God! It\u2019s all right. They didn\u2019t take my comic books.\nCredits sequence. \n \nScene: The apartment. \nSheldon: They took our TV, two laptops, four external hard-drives, our PS2, our PS3, our X-Box, our X-Box 360, our classic Nintendo, our Super Nintendo, our Nintendo 64 and our Wii.\nLeonard: We like games.\nSheldon: Right, games. They took Halo 1, Halo 2, Halo 3, Call of Duty 1, Call of Duty 2, Call of Duty 3, Rock Band, Rock Band 2, Final Fantasy 1 thru 9, The Legend of Zelda, The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess, Super Mario Brothers, Super Mario Galaxy, Mario and Sonic at the Winter Olympics and Ms. Pacman.\nPoliceman: Assorted video games.\nSheldon: When does the CSI team get here?\nPoliceman: What?\nSheldon: In anticipation of their arrival, I\u2019ve bagged some evidence. One of the thieves had the audacity to quench his thirst while ransacking our home. You should be able to pull some good prints off this. And now, here are my prints so you can rule me out as a suspect.\nLeonard: What about me?\nSheldon: I\u2019m sorry, Leonard. It\u2019s too early to discount the possibility of this being an inside job.\nLeonard: Would I be completely out of line to ask you to shoot him?\nPoliceman: I\u2019d be happy to put him under a 72-hour psychiatric hold.\nSheldon: I\u2019m not crazy. My mother had me tested.\nPoliceman: We\u2019re done here. Call this number, and we\u2019ll fax you a copy of the report so you can submit it to your insurance company.\nSheldon: I\u2019m sorry, that\u2019s the end of your inquiry?\nPoliceman: Do you have any more information that might be relevant?\nSheldon: Oh, my goodness. Where do I begin? For instance, my laptop contained four out of the five gedanken experiments necessary for a cogent restatement of the quantum measurement problem.\nLeonard: How is that going to help them?\nSheldon: Well, they could monitor scientific publications and see if anyone posts such a cogent restatement in the next couple of months. If so, the authors are most likely in possession of my stolen laptop.\nPoliceman: Good night, fellas. Come on, Bochco.\nLeonard: What are we supposed to do now?\nSheldon: The only thing we can do. Watch TV on our phones until the criminals return and bludgeon us to death in our sleep.\nLeonard: Does that mean you\u2019ve ruled me out as a suspect?\nSheldon: Oh, how I wish I could.\nScene: Sheldon\u2019s bedroom. Sheldon is restless. He gets up and checks the door is locked. He then moves his chest of drawers in front of the door. Goes back to bed.\n \nSheldon: I do not have to urinate. I am the master of my own bladder. Drat.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment.\nPenny: I can\u2019t believe it. If I hadn\u2019t been working the dinner shift, I would\u2019ve run\nright into the robbers.\nLeonard: Hey, there\u2019s no reason for you to be scared.\nPenny: I\u2019m not scared. I would\u2019ve gone all Nebraska on their asses.\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard and Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard and Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard and Penny.\nLeonard: Hand me the bat.\nSheldon: We just had a major crime in the building, and you open the door without asking who it is?\nPenny: It won\u2019t happen again, what\u2019s up?\nSheldon: Nothing. Just wanted to see if you were both okay.\nLeonard: We\u2019re fine, Sheldon.\nSheldon: All right, then. Good night.\nPenny: Good night. That was weird, even for him.\nLeonard: Mm-hmm.\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard and Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard and Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard and Penny.\nPenny: Who is it?\nSheldon: Sheldon. Sheldon Cooper.\nPenny: Yes?\nSheldon: May I come in?\nPenny: Yeah.\nSheldon: I see you\u2019re drinking wine.\nLeonard: Yes, we are. And we\u2019re about to go to bed.\nSheldon: Uh-huh.\nPenny: Sheldon, do you want to sleep here tonight?\nSheldon: Oh, as small as Leonard is, I don\u2019t think the two of you\u2019d be comfortable on the couch.\nLeonard: What do you want?\nSheldon: It\u2019s not what I want, it\u2019s what evolution wants. Human beings are primates. Primates have evolved to live in groups, both for protection and support.\nLeonard: But you don\u2019t like other people.\nSheldon: I do tonight. It\u2019s scary over there.\nLeonard: It\u2019s getting scary here, too.\nScene: The apartment. Sheldon is drawing picture clues on his whiteboard. \nPenny: Um\u2026 three little kittens? Three little pigs? God, I don\u2019t know. Star Wars?\nLeonard: Did we win? Can we go to bed?\nSheldon: Good Lord, I could not have made this easier. Hydrogen atom, H, plus pigs minus pea, Higgs. Bow, General Zod trapped in the Phantom Zone. Bow-zone. Pear. Tickle. Pear-tickle. Higgs Boson Particle. How could you not get that?\nLeonard: He\u2019s right, Penny. It\u2019s all there.\nPenny: Look, Sheldon, sweetie, I know you\u2019re feeling insecure, but we\u2019ve really got to go to sleep.\nSheldon: All right. I\u2019ll take the first watch and wake you at 0400.\nLeonard: Great. Good night.\nPenny: Wait, wait, what\u2019s 0400?\nLeonard: 4am.\nPenny: That\u2019s, like, in 45 minutes.\nLeonard: Just keep walking. (Sheldon checks door then puts TV on his phone)\nWoman on TV: It\u2019s quiet out there.\nMan on TV: Maybe a little too quiet.\nWoman on TV: Where are you going?\nMan on TV: Just gonna take a look around outside.\nSheldon: Bad idea.\nWoman on TV: No, Jim, don\u2019t open the door!\nSheldon: Listen to her, Jim.\nMan on TV: Don\u2019t worry, there\u2019s no one out here. (Sound of woman screaming. Sheldon nods, and turns off TV. Walks down to Leonard\u2019s room.)\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard and Penny! (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard and Penny! (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard and Penny!\nLeonard: Who is it?\nScene: Outside the apartment. \nHoward: All right, we\u2019ve got a titanium dead bolt and a reinforced jamb controlled by a state-of-the-art electronic access system.\nSheldon: What if they cut the power?\nRaj: There\u2019s a 200-watt uninterruptible backup power supply.\nSheldon: What if someone steals my keys?\nRaj: There are independent voice and fingerprint scanners.\nSheldon: What if someone kidnaps me, forces me to record my voice, and then cuts off my thumb?\nLeonard: I\u2019ll send them a basket of muffins.\nHoward: Now, inside, we\u2019ve got motion detectors, infrared sensors, and cameras connected to a server running state-of-the-art facial recognition software.\nLeonard: Where did you get all this stuff?\nHoward: I got a buddy over at the Department of Defence.\nLeonard: He just gave it to you?\nHoward: I\u2019m sure he would have if I had asked. Ironically, their security isn\u2019t all that good.\nPenny (entering): Raj, your car is blocking me\u2026 (A wire net falls on her, while a computer voice repeats the words \u201cIntruder Alert\u201d) What the hell?\nLeonard: Sorry, let me help you.\nSheldon: Wonderful security system if we\u2019re attacked by a school of tuna.\nHoward: Don\u2019t worry, the net\u2019s going to be electrified. Picture her on the floor, spasming uncontrollably.\nSheldon: Better.\nScene: Sheldon\u2019s bedroom. \nSheldon: Sheldon\u2019s journal. Security system in place. However, sleep continues to elude me. I\u2019ve seen the underbelly of Pasadena, this so-called City of Roses, and it haunts me. Ah, the injustice, I lie here awake, tormented, while out there evil lurks, probably playing Donkey Kong on my classic Nintendo. (Hears a noise. Goes to check, then panics and climbs out window onto ledge.) Oh, dear. I am the master of my own bladder. (Crawls along to Leonard\u2019s window, where Leonard and Penny are inside being intimate. Knock, knock, knock) Leonard and Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard and Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard and Penny.\nPenny: Oh, my\u2026\nLeonard: God, Sheldon. What the hell are you doing out there?\nSheldon: I heard a noise.\nLeonard: It was us. We knocked over a lamp.\nSheldon: Why would you knock over a lamp?\nLeonard: We were going to have\u2026\nPenny: He doesn\u2019t need to know what we were doing, Leonard.\nSheldon: Oh! No, she\u2019s right, I don\u2019t need to know what you were doing. Carry on. (Starts to climb back out of window)\nLeonard: What are you doing? Use the door.\nSheldon: Good thinking. Perhaps I\u2019ll check the perimeter and make some warm milk.\nLeonard: Great, you do that.\nSheldon: Would you like me to bring you some warm milk?\nLeonard: I\u2019m lactose intolerant.\nSheldon: And you don\u2019t wish to alarm me with any more loud noises, very thoughtful. Warm milk, Penny?\nPenny: No, thanks.\nSheldon: Fine. Good night to you, sir. Miss.\nLeonard: Sorry about that.\nPenny: Ugh, what can you do? Here. (From outside there is the sound of the net falling and computer voice saying \u201cIntruder alert.\u201d Then Sheldon screaming. They run out to find Sheldon convulsing under the net.)\nLeonard: Looks like Wolowitz got the net electrified.\nPenny: Sheldon, are you okay?\nSheldon: I\u2019m fine. Although I\u2019m no longer the master of my own bladder.\nScene: The apartment. \nSheldon: My new computer came with Windows 7. Windows 7 is much more user-friendly than Windows Vista. I don\u2019t like that.\nLeonard: Don\u2019t you think looking for a new city to live in is a bit of an overreaction?\nSheldon: Our apartment was broken into, our security system tried to kill me, and as a result, I\u2019m leaving Pasadena forever. Tell me how that\u2019s overreacting.\nPenny: Come on, Sheldon, you can\u2019t move. Don\u2019t you need to stay in one place so the mother ship can find you when it returns?\nSheldon: Oh, if that were only true. Unfortunately, as I\u2019m earthbound for the foreseeable future, I need to find a location that\u2019s more hospitable than the mean streets of Pasadena. Like Enid, Oklahoma. Low crime rate and high-speed Internet connectivity, but no model train shops. Sorry, Enid.\nPenny: Is he quitting his job at the university?\nLeonard: Oh, no, he\u2019s going to telecommute. Everybody\u2019s really excited about it.\nSheldon: All right. Boone, North Carolina. Every summer since 1952, Boone has hosted an outdoor amphitheater portrayal of the life and times of its namesake, Dan\u2019l Boone. Sounds like something that would attract the wrong crowd. Penny, you\u2019re from Nebraska, correct?\nPenny: Born and raised. (Sheldon crosses Nebraska off his map)\nScene: Sheldon\u2019s bedroom. Sheldon is packing. \nSheldon: It will take me a few days to get settled. After I do, I will e-mail you detailed PDFs containing diagrams and instructions that will guide you through packing and shipping the rest of my possessions to Bozeman, Montana. In the meantime, please forward my mail.\nLeonard: Any place specific or just the Bozeman, Montana Loony Bin?\nSheldon: I sense you\u2019re making a joke, but Bozeman does have a comedy club called The Loony Bin, so do not forward my mail there.\nHoward: Oh, come on. So you were the victim of a crime. That\u2019s part of life. When my great-grandfather first came to this country, he put all his hopes and dreams into this little butcher shop he ran on the Lower East Side of New York. You know what happened? Every customer who walked into that butcher shop and asked for a pound of liver, got ripped off. But, those people moved on, and so should you.\nSheldon: I am moving on. I\u2019m going to be a Bozite.\nLeonard: They call themselves Bozites?\nSheldon: They should. It\u2019s one of the first things I plan to bring up upon arrival.\nPenny: Sheldon, I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m saying this, but I\u2019m going to miss you.\nSheldon: Please, Penny, as you know, I\u2019m not comfortable with prolonged good-byes and maudlin displays of emotion, so I prepared a short video.\nSheldon on laptop screen: Greetings. As you know, I\u2019m not comfortable with prolonged good-byes and maudlin displays of emotion, so I prepared this short video. The four of you are three of my closest friends and one treasured acquaintance. Though I cannot state categorically that my life will be diminished by not having you in it, I am comfortable if you choose to believe that. Since you intend to remain in this lawless metropolitan area, statistics suggest that you will succumb to tragic and gruesome ends before we meet again. Live long and prosper.\nPenny: Sheldon, that\u2019s so\u2026 (Turns to find he has gone.)\nSheldon (entering again): You might want to lock the door behind me. This isn\u2019t Bozeman.\nHoward (after Raj whispers to him): How the hell do I know who\u2019s the friend and who\u2019s the acquaintance?\nScene: Bozeman, Montana bus depot. \nSheldon: That is a bracing cold, an invigorating cold. Lord, is it cold!\nMan: Help you with your bags, sir?\nSheldon: Thank you, fellow Bozite. And may I say, you are the living embodiment of all the promises made by our lovely town\u2019s Chamber of Commerce. (Man picks up bags and starts running.) Wait! Wait! Excuse me! (At ticket desk) One ticket to Pasadena, California, please.\nScene: The apartment. Sheldon enters.\nHoward: Hey, look who\u2019s back!\nSheldon: Interesting. The acquaintance is the first to greet me.\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "1_3": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: Sheldon and Leonard\u2019s apartment. Sheldon, Leonard, Howard and Raj are using laptops. All are wearing microphone headsets.\nHoward: Alright, just a few more feet, and\u2026. here we are gentlemen, the Gates of Elzebub.\nSheldon: Good lord!\nRaj: Oooh.\nLeonard: Don\u2019t panic, this is what the last 97 hours have been about.\nHoward: Stay frosty, there\u2019s a horde of armed goblins on the other side of that gate guarding the Sword of Azeroth.\nLeonard: Warriors, unsheathe your weapons, magic wielders raise your wands.\nSheldon: Lock and load. \nHoward: Raj, blow up the gates.\nRaj: Blowing the gates. Control, shift, B! Oh, my God, so many goblins!\nHoward: Don\u2019t just stand there, slash and move, slash and move.\nLeonard: Stay in formation.\nHoward: Leonard, you\u2019ve got one on your tail.\nLeonard: That\u2019s alright, my tail\u2019s prehensile, I\u2019ll swat him off.\nRaj: I\u2019ve got him Leonard. Tonight I spice my meat with goblin blood!\nLeonard: Raj, no, it\u2019s a trap, they\u2019re flanking us!\nRaj: Oooh, he\u2019s got me.\nHoward: Sheldon, he\u2019s got Raj, use your sleath spell. Sheldon! Sheldon!\nSheldon: I\u2019ve got the Sword of Azeroth!\nLeonard: Forget the sword, Sheldon, help Raj.\nSheldon: There is no more Sheldon, I am the Swordmaster!\nHoward: Leonard look out!\nLeonard: Dammit man, we\u2019re dying here. \nSheldon: Goodbye, peasants. \nLeonard: The bastard teleported. \nRaj: He\u2019s selling the Sword of Azeroth on ebay.\nLeonard: You betrayed us for money, who are you?\nSheldon: I\u2019m a rogue knight elf, don\u2019t you people read character descriptions? Wait, wait, wait, somebody just clicked \u201cbuy it now.\u201d\nHoward: I am the Swordmaster!\nCredits sequence\nScene: The same.\nSheldon: Wooh, I\u2019m all sweaty, anybody want to log on to second life and go swimming, I just built a virtual pool.\nLeonard: No, I can\u2019t look at you or your avatar right now.\n(Sound of female laughter from out in the hall).\nHoward: Sounds like your neighbour\u2019s home.\nLeonard: Excuse me.\nSheldon: Don\u2019t forget the mail you took accidentally on purpose so you\u2019d have an excuse to talk to her.\nLeonard: Oh, right, right right right right.\nHoward: Stealing snail mail, very old school, I like it. \nLeonard (exiting to hallway): Penny, the mailman did it again, he\u2026 (looks up to see Penny kissing a hunky man) Oh! Sorry.\nPenny: Um, no, hi Leonard, this is Doug, Doug, this is my neighbour Leonard.\nDoug: What\u2019s up bro.\nLeonard: Not much. Bro. \nPenny: Is, is everything okay.\nLeonard: Uh, yeah, uh, I just, I got your mail again, here.\nPenny: Thank you, I\u2019ve got to talk to that mailman.\nLeonard: Oh no, that\u2019s probably not such a good idea. Civil servants have a documented propensity to, you know, snap. \nPenny: Okay, well, thank you, again.\nLeonard: No problem. Bye. Oh, and, bye, bro! (Returns to apartment).\nSheldon: Penny for your thoughts. \nRaj: What\u2019s the matter.\nLeonard: No, I\u2019m fine. Penny\u2019s fine, the guy she\u2019s kissing is really fine and\u2026\nHoward: Kissing, what kind of kissing? Cheeks? Lips? Chaste? French? \nLeonard: What is wrong with you?\nHoward: I\u2019m a romantic.\nSheldon: Please don\u2019t tell me that your hopeless infatuation is devolving into pointless jealousy.\nLeonard: No, I\u2019m not jealous, I\u2019m just a little concerned for her. I didn\u2019t like the look of the guy that she was with.\nHoward: Because he looked better than you?\nLeonard: Yeah. He was kinda dreamy.\nSheldon: Well, at least now you can retrieve the black box from the twisted smouldering wreckage that was once your fantasy of dating her, and analyse the data so that you don\u2019t crash into geek mountain again.\nHoward: I disagree, love is not a sprint, it\u2019s a marathon. A relentless pursuit that only ends when she falls into your arms. Or hits you with the pepper spray. \nLeonard: Well, I\u2019m done with Penny. I\u2019m going to be more realistic and go after someone my own speed.\nRaj: Like who?\nLeonard: I don\u2019t know. Olivia Geiger?\nSheldon: The dietician at the cafeteria with the limp and the lazy eye?\nLeonard: Yeah.\nSheldon: Well, I don\u2019t think you have a shot there. I have noticed that Lesley Winkle recently started shaving her legs. Now, given that winter is coming one can only assume that she is signalling sexual availability. \nHoward: I don\u2019t know, you guys work in the same lab.\nLeonard: So?\nHoward: There are pitfalls, trust me, I know. When it comes to sexual harassment law I\u2019m\u2026 a bit of a self-taught expert. \nLeonard: Look, Howard, if I were to ask Lesley Winkle out it would just be for dinner, I\u2019m not going to walk into the lab, ask her to strip naked and dance for me.\nHoward: Oh, then you\u2019re probably okay.\nScene: Howard and Lesley\u2019s lab.\nLeonard: Hello Lesley.\nLesley: Hi Leonard. \nLeonard: Lesley I would like to propose an experiment.\nLesley: Goggles, Leonard.\nLeonard: Right. Lesley, I would like to propose an experiment.\nLesley: Hang on. I\u2019m trying to see how long it takes a five hundred kilowatt oxygen iodine laser to heat up my cup o\u2019 noodles.\nLeonard: Pfff, I\u2019ve done it, about two seconds, 2.6 for minestrone. Anyway, I was thinking more of a bio-social exploration with a neuro-chemical overlay. \nLesley: Wait, are you asking me out?\nLeonard: I was going to characterise it as the modification of our colleague/friendship paradigm, with the addition of a date-like component. But we don\u2019t need to quibble over terminology. \nLesley: What sort of experiment would you propose?\nLeonard: There is a generally accepted pattern in this area, I would pick you up, take you to a restaurant, then we would see a movie, probably a romantic comedy featuring the talents of Hugh Grant or Sandra Bullock. \nLesley: Interesting. And would you agree that the primary way we would evaluate either the success or failure of the date would be based on the bio-chemical reaction during the goodnight kiss.\nLeonard: Heartrate, pheromones, etc, yes. \nLesley: Well, why don\u2019t we just stipulate that the date goes well and move to the key variable.\nLeonard: You mean, kiss you now?\nLesley: Yes. \nLeonard: Can you define the parameters of the kiss?\nLesley: Closed mouth but romantic. Mint?\nLeonard: Thank you. (Takes mint). Shall I count down from three?\nLesley: No, I think it needs to be spontaneous.\n(They kiss.)\nLesley: What do you think.\nLeonard: You proposed the experiment, I think you should present your findings first.\nLesley: Fair enough. On the plus side, it was a good kiss, reasonable technique, no extraneous spittle. On the other hand, no arousal. \nLeonard: None?\nLesley: None.\nLeonard: Ah. Well, thank you for your time.\nLesley: Thank you. \n(They shake hands. Leonard leaves. Then returns.)\nLeonard: None at all?\nScene: Sheldon and Leonard\u2019s flat. Sheldon, Raj and Howard are playing Jenga. \nHoward: Sheldon, if you were a robot, and I knew and you didn\u2019t, would you want me to tell you?\nSheldon: That depends. When I learn that I\u2019m a robot, will I be able to handle it?\nHoward: Maybe, although the history of science-fiction is not on your side. \nSheldon: Uh, let me ask you this. When I learn that I\u2019m a robot, would I be bound by Asimov\u2019s three laws of robotics?\nRaj: You might be bound by them right now.\nHoward: That\u2019s true. Have you ever harmed a human being, or through inaction allowed a human being to come to harm?\nSheldon: Of course not. \nHoward: Have you ever harmed yourself, or allowed yourself to be harmed except in cases where a human being would have been endangered?\nSheldon: Well, no.\nHoward: I smell robot. \nLeonard (entering): Hey, what\u2019s going on.\nSheldon: The internet\u2019s been down for half an hour. \nRaj: Also, Sheldon may be a robot. \nHoward: So, how did it go with Lesley? \nLeonard: Oh, we tried kissing, but the earth didn\u2019t move. I mean any more than the 383 miles that it was going to move anyway. \nSheldon: Oh, I\u2019ve seen that look before. This is just going to be two weeks of moping and tedious emo songs, and calling me to come down to pet stores to look at cats. I don\u2019t know if I can take it. \nRaj: You could power down.\nHoward: Well, as usual, Wolowitz has the solution. I happen to know a place where there are plenty of eligible women, and Leonard could have his pick.\nScene: A salsa class. The four guys and a random fat bloke salsa opposite five middle-aged women.\nClass instructor: Remember the Latin hips. Shoulders stay still, and we sway. One two three. Five six seven. \nHoward (to Leonard): I think Mrs Tishman\u2019s got her eye on you. I\u2019ve been there, you\u2019re in for a treat. \nScene: The flat, Leonard is entering, singing to himself a depressing emo song.\nSheldon: Oh, good lord.\nLeonard (singing): You don\u2019t know me, you don\u2019t wear my chains\u2026 God, that\u2019s a good song. \nSheldon: If you\u2019re compiling a mix CD for a double suicide. (Leonard is taking supplies out of a bag) Oh, I hope that scratching post is for you.\nLeonard: I know what you\u2019re thinking, I\u2019ve taken your asthma into account. There\u2019s a feline geneticist in San Diego who has developed the cutest little hypo-allergenic calicos. \nSheldon: Leonard, listen to me\u2026\nLeonard: I\u2019ve been thinking about names, I\u2019m kind of torn between Einstein, Newton and Sergeant Fuzzyboots. \nSheldon: Leonard, do you really think you can satisfy your need for a relationship with a genetically altered cat?\nLeonard: Maybe, if it\u2019s a cute little cuddly cat.\nSheldon: Oh, come on, Leonard! This is obviously about Penny. \nLeonard: It doesn\u2019t matter. The woman\u2019s not interested in me, the woman rejected me. \nSheldon: Okay, look, I think that you have as much of a chance of having a sexual relationship with Penny as the Hubble Telescope does of discovering at the centre of every black hole is a little man with a flashlight searching for a circuit breaker. Nevertheless, I do feel obligated to point out to you that she did no reject you. You did not ask her out. \nLeonard: You\u2019re right. I didn\u2019t ask her out, I should ask her out.\nSheldon: No. No, now that was not my point. My point was, don\u2019t buy a cat. \nLeonard: No, but you\u2019re right. I should march over there and ask her out. \nSheldon: Oh, goody, we\u2019re getting a cat. \nScene: The hallway. Leonard knocks on Penny\u2019s door. \nPenny (opening door): Ah, hey Leonard.\nLeonard: Good afternoon Penny, so hi, hey. Uh\u2026 I was wondering if you had plans for dinner.\nPenny: Uh, do you mean dinner tonight?\nLeonard: There is an inherent ambiguity in the word dinner. Technically it refers to the largest meal of the day whenever it is consumed, so, to clarify here, by dinner I mean supper.\nPenny: Supper?\nLeonard: Or dinner. I was thinking six thirty, if you can go, or a different time.\nPenny: Uh, six thirty\u2019s great.\nLeonard: Really? Great!\nPenny: Yeah, I like hanging out with you guys.\nLeonard: Us guys?\nPenny: You know, Sheldon, Howard, Raj, who all\u2019s coming?\nLeonard: They\u2026. might all be there. Or a subset of them might be there, uh, algebraically speaking there are too many unknowns, for example Sheldon had Quizznos for lunch, sometimes he finds that filling, other times he doesn\u2019t, it\u2019s no fault of Quizznos, they have a varied menu.\nPenny: Okay, whatever, it sounds like fun.\nLeonard: Great. Did we say a time?\nPenny: Six thirty.\nLeonard: And that\u2019s still good for you.\nPenny: It\u2019s fine.\nLeonard: Cos it\u2019s not carved in stone.\nPenny: No, six thirty\u2019s great.\nLeonard: I\u2019ll get my chisel.\nPenny: Why?\nLeonard: To\u2026 carve the\u2026 okay, I\u2019ll see you six thirty.\nScene: Sheldon and Leonard\u2019s apartment. Leonard enters from bedrooms, dressed in a smart shirt and trousers. They are covered in sweat stains.\nLeonard: How do I look?\nSheldon: Could you be more specific?\nLeonard: Can you tell I\u2019m perspiring a little?\nSheldon: No. The dark crescent-shaped patterns under your arms conceal it nicely. What time is your date?\nLeonard: Six thirty. \nSheldon: Perfect, that gives you two hours and fifteen minutes for that dense molecular cloud of Aramis to dissipate. \nLeonard: Is it too much?\nSheldon: Not if you\u2019re a rugby team. \nLeonard: By the way, if it should ever come up, you didn\u2019t join us because you stuffed yourself with a chicken carbonara sub at Quizznos. \nSheldon: Why would I join you?\nLeonard: No reason. Oh, you know what, maybe this isn\u2019t such a good idea. \nSheldon: Oh, no, no, no, well now, there\u2019s always the possibility that alcohol and poor judgement on her part might lead to a nice romantic evening.\nLeonard: You\u2019re right, alcohol, poor judgement, it could go well.\nSheldon: Of course, there\u2019s the other possibility that this date kicks off a rather unpleasant six months of the two of you passing awkwardly in the hall until one of you breaks down and moves to another zip code.\nLeonard: You could have stopped at \u201cit could go well.\u201d\nSheldon: If I could of, I would of. \nLeonard: I mean, I\u2019m a perfectly nice guy. There\u2019s no reason we couldn\u2019t go to the restaurant and have a lovely dinner. Maybe take a walk afterwards, talk about things we have in common, \u201cyou love pottery? I love pottery!\u201d You know, there\u2019s a pause, we both know what\u2019s happening, I lean in, we kiss, it\u2019s a little tentative at first but then I realise, she\u2019s kissing me back, and she\u2019s biting my lower lip, you know, she wants me, this thing is going the distance, we\u2019re going to have sex! Oh God! Oh, my God!\nSheldon: Is the sex starting now?\nLeonard: I\u2019m having a panic attack.\nSheldon: Oh, okay, well then, calm down.\nLeonard: If I could calm down I wouldn\u2019t be having a panic attack, that\u2019s why they call it a panic attack.\nSheldon: Alright, alright, well, just, sit down, yes, sit down, now close your eyes.\nLeonard: Why?\nSheldon: Just do it.\nLeonard: Okay.\nSheldon: Now try to increase your alpha-wave activity.\nLeonard: What?\nSheldon: It\u2019s a bio-feedback technique, it\u2019s relaxation through brain-wave manipulation, I read a paper about it in the Journal of American Neuroscience, it was a little sparsely sourced but I think the basic science is valid, I probably have it here somewhere.\nLeonard: Oh, who am I kidding, I can\u2019t go through with this, you need to call her and cancel.\nSheldon: Me?\nLeonard: Yes.\nSheldon: What should I tell her.\nLeonard: I don\u2019t know. Tell her I\u2019m sick.\nSheldon: Okay.\nLeonard: Not the kind of illness that will make her want to come over and take care of me, but nothing so critical that she\u2019ll feel uncomfortable going out with me in the future if I want to try this again.\nSheldon: Got it. So I\u2019m assuming nothing venereal. I\u2019ll just tell her that you had a routine colonoscopy and haven\u2019t quite bounced back.\nLeonard: Give me the phone. \nSheldon: But I thought you wanted to cancel?\nLeonard: I can\u2019t because if I don\u2019t show up she\u2019ll still be expecting you.\nSheldon: Why would she be expecting me? \nLeonard: Stop asking me all these questions, I need to take another shower.\nScene: A restaurant.\nPenny: So are the rest of the guys meeting us here?\nLeonard: Oh, yeah, no. Turns out that Raj and Howard had to work, and Sheldon had a colonoscopy and he hasn\u2019t quite bounced back yet. \nPenny: Ooh, my uncle just had a colonoscopy.\nLeonard: You\u2019re kidding, well, then, that\u2019s something we have in common. \nPenny: How?\nLeonard: We both have people in our lives who\u2026 want to nip intestinal polyps in the bud. \nPenny: So, what\u2019s new in the world of physics?\nLeonard: Nothing.\nPenny: Really, nothing?\nLeonard: Well, with the exception of string theory, not much has happened since the 1930\u2019s, and you can\u2019t prove string theory, at best you can say \u201chey, look, my idea has an internal logical consistency.\u201d\nPenny: Ah. Well I\u2019m sure things will pick up. \nLeonard: What\u2019s new at the Cheesecake Factory?\nPenny: Oh, uh, not much. We do have a chocolate key lime that\u2019s moving pretty well. \nLeonard: Good. Good. And what about your, uh, hallway friend.\nPenny: Doug? Oh, yeah, I dunno, I mean, he\u2019s nice and funny, but\u2026\nWaitress: Can I get you started with some drinks?\nLeonard: No, (waves her away) You were saying, but\u2026\nPenny: I\u2019d like a drink.\nLeonard: Just say the but thing about Doug and then I\u2019ll get her back. \nPenny: Okay, well, you know, it\u2019s just me. I\u2019m still getting over this break-up with Kurt, and this thing with Doug would be just rebound sex.\nLeonard: Ugh, don\u2019t get me started on rebound sex.\nPenny: It\u2019s just, it\u2019s my pattern. I break up, then I find some cute guy, and then it\u2019s just thirty six meaningless of\u2026 well, you know. \nLeonard: I\u2019m not sure that I do. Um, is that one thirty-six hour experience, or is it thirty six hours spread out over say, one\u2026 glorious summer.\nPenny: No, it\u2019s usually over a weekend, and trust me, you do not feel good after it.\nLeonard: Well, chafing, right?\nPenny: Emotionally.\nLeonard: Of course, yeah, emotional chafing. Hey, do you want to see something cool? (Penny nods.) I can make this olive go into this glass without touching it. \nPenny: How?\nLeonard: Physics. (He places the glass over the olive and spins it until the olive gets caught up on the side).\nPenny: Wow, centrifugal force!\nLeonard: Actually, it\u2019s centripetal force, which is an inward force generated by the glass acting on the olive. (The olive drops.) Excuse me. (Leonard disappears under table.)Now, if you were riding on the olive, you\u2019d be in a non-inertial reference frame, and would (he bangs his head on the underside of the table.)\nPenny: Are you okay?\nLeonard: Yeah, I\u2019m okay. Did you spill ketchup?\nPenny: No.\nLeonard: I\u2019m not okay.\nScene: The stairwell of the apartment building.\nPenny: Are you sure you don\u2019t want to go to the emergency room?\nLeonard: No, no, I\u2019m okay, it\u2019s stopped bleeding.\nPenny: I know, but you did throw up. Isn\u2019t that a sign of a concussion?\nLeonard: Yes, but I get car sick too, so\u2026\nPenny: Okay.\nLeonard: Sorry about your car, by the way.\nPenny: Oh, no, it\u2019s fine, you got most of it out the window. \nLeonard: The poor guy on the bike. I had a nice time.\nPenny: Yeah, me too. Um, good night. (Leonard turns across hallway.) Leonard?\nLeonard: Yeah.\nPenny: Was this supposed to be a date?\nLeonard: This? No. No, of course not, this was just you and me hanging out with a bunch of guys who didn\u2019t show up, because of work and a colonoscopy.\nPenny: Okay, I was just checking.\nLeonard: When I take a girl out on a date, and I do, she knows she\u2019s been dated. Capital D. Bold face, underline, like Day-ted. I think I might have a little concussion, I\u2019m going to go lay down for a while, good night. \nScene: The apartment, Leonard enters.\nSheldon: So, how was your date?\nLeonard: Awesome!\nSheldon: Score one for liquor and poor judgement.\nTeleplay: Bill Prady & Steven Molaro\n Story: Chuck Lorre\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "6_14": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The Apartment.\nLeonard: Sheldon, your food\u2019s getting cold.\nSheldon: I\u2019ll eat later. Right now, I\u2019m suckling at the informative bosom of mother physics.\nPenny: It\u2019s hot when Sheldon talks dirty.\nRaj: So, I found this Web site where you send them pictures, they sculpt your head and make an action figure out of you. How awesome is that?\nHoward: Let me see.\nRaj: Yeah, you can pick your wardrobe. You can even choose your accessories.\nHoward: Leonard, you can get a little asthma inhaler.\nLeonard: Oh, this is neat. Think about all the action figures we\u2019ve bought over the years. It would be kind of cool to have ones that look like us. Don\u2019t you think?\nPenny: Yeah, if that\u2019s your idea of what\u2019s cool, you should get one.\nLeonard: Yeah, so, I\u2019m out.\nRaj: What do you think, Sheldon? Want an action figure that looks just like you?\nSheldon: Would it come with Kung-Fu grip?\nRaj: No.\nSheldon: Don\u2019t waste my time.\nLeonard: You get that these are personalised action figures.\nPenny: Honey, if you want one, just get one.\nHoward: You\u2019re still out, right?\nLeonard: Yep.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: Sheldon\u2019s office.\nSheldon: A hush falls over the crowd as Cooper studies the board. He makes his move. He\u2019s dividing both sides by I. He\u2019s adding back the coefficient. He has a value for P. He\u2019s plugging that back in. He takes the derivative, and he solves the equation. The crowd goes wild. Nobel! Nobel!\nKripke: Cooper?\nSheldon: Nobel. Kripke. Don\u2019t look at my board.\nKripke: What\u2019s that?\nSheldon: That\u2019s a drawing of a really cool train. Don\u2019t look at that, either. What do you want?\nKripke: I have some bad news. You\u2019re working on a gwant pwoposal fow a new fusion weactow. I\u2019m working on a gwant pwoposal fow a new fusion weactow. The university is only awowed to submit one pwoposal.\nSheldon: So they asked you to pack up your things and ship out. That\u2019s hard cheese, Barry. You\u2019re one of the good ones.\nKripke: No, they\u2019re making us work together.\nSheldon: That\u2019s ridiculous. I am one of the great minds of our generation. I work on a level so rarified you couldn\u2019t even imagine it. I said stop looking at my cool train!\nScene: Howard\u2019s lab.\nLeonard: Hmm. Kind of a strange place to put a picture of you and Bernadette.\nHoward: Well, I wanted everybody to know I love my wife. And nobody to know I forgot to turn off the laser.\nRaj: They\u2019re here. Our action figures have arrived. This is the best five hundred dollars I\u2019ve ever spent.\nLeonard: A thousand dollars on action figures? How can you afford that?\nHoward: Easy. His family\u2019s loaded, and Bernadette has a great job. My wife came with both fun bags and money bags.\nRaj: Say hello to an exact scale model of me. Oh, I\u2019m not dark chocolate. I\u2019m melt-in-your-mouth caramel.\nHoward: Oh, man. Look at my nose.\nLeonard: Maybe it\u2019s a shipping problem.\nHoward: What?\nLeonard: Yeah. Maybe Wesley Snipes and Toucan Sam just got action figures that look like you guys.\nRaj: This sucks.\nHoward: I can\u2019t believe I wasted all that money.\nLeonard: Aw, and my girlfriend wouldn\u2019t let me get one. Look at my face. Do I look smug? I feel smug.\nScene: The stairwell.\nPenny: I hate it when you make me sit through all the credits.\nLeonard: Well, sometimes there\u2019s a secret ending, like in The Avengers.\nPenny: Yeah, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to happen in a documentary about the Holocaust.\nLeonard: They could show bloopers. Oh, no.\nPenny: What is that?\nLeonard: That is Sheldon\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m unhappy and about to destroy the planet\u201d music. Come on, let\u2019s just go to your place.\nPenny: Well, wait, if he\u2019s unhappy,shouldn\u2019t we talk to him?\nLeonard: Shouldn\u2019t we talk to him? Have you learned nothing in six years?\nPenny (entering apartment): You doing okay, sweetie?\nSheldon: There is ominous music playing, and there is an afghan over my head. I don\u2019t know where you\u2019re from, but where I\u2019m from, that means I\u2019m not doing okay.\nLeonard: Want me to make you some tea?\nSheldon: Tea is for when I\u2019m upset. I\u2019m not upset. The university\u2019s forcing me to work with Kripke. I\u2019m outraged.\nLeonard: So, cocoa?\nSheldon: Yes, cocoa. Do you have any idea what it\u2019s like to be paired with someone who\u2019s so incredibly annoying?\nLeonard: Oh, teacher! Me! Me!\nSheldon: See, I did all this great work, and now he\u2019s just going to come along and ruin it. I am angrier than ever and filled with despair.\nPenny: What beverage do you make for that?\nLeonard: Oh, no, no, no, I know this. Uh, hot apple cider with cinnamon sticks?\nSheldon: Yes, hot apple cider with cinnamon sticks!\nScene: Sheldon\u2019s office.\nKripke: What the fwig, Cooper? We were supposed to meet in my office a half an hour ago.\nSheldon: And yet, now you\u2019re in my office. Point, Cooper. Welcome to the Thunderdome, Kripke.\nKripke: We agweed to exchange copies of our work. Let me see yours.\nSheldon: Why don\u2019t you show me yours first.\nKripke: You think I just few off the turnip twuck? We exchange at the same time.\nSheldon: How do I know you\u2019re not going to take my ideas and publish them as your own?\nKripke: How do I know you\u2019re not going to do that with mine?\nSheldon: Because I\u2019m not interested in getting published in Mad magazine. Zingers fly fast in the Thunderdome, Barry.\nKripke: Are we going to do this or not? Thank you. So, we wead each other\u2019s work, meet again tomowow?\nSheldon: Fine.\nKripke: Nice twy. This is bwank paper.\nSheldon: And I am sure it\u2019s still more valuable than whatever\u2019s in here.\nKripke: Cough it up, Cooper.\nSheldon: Very well.\nKripke: If this one\u2019s bwank, too, I\u2019m going to be fuwious.\nSheldon: Fine.\nScene: Howard\u2019s lab.\nRaj: You! Always bet on black.\nHoward: Get that waste of money out of my face.\nRaj: It\u2019s only a waste of money if we don\u2019t play with them. (As doll) He\u2019s right, dawg.\nHoward: Please, I\u2019m working.\nRaj: You know, there is a way we can get action figures to look exactly like us.\nHoward: Oh, yeah? How\u2019s that?\nRaj: Two words, 3-D printer. Wait, maybe it\u2019s three words. No, hang on. Okay, one word, a letter and a number and maybe a hyphen. 3-D printer.\nHoward: I have always wanted a 3-D printer.\nRaj: Of course you have. They\u2019re an engineer\u2019s dream. Anything you can design, a 3-D printer can make out of plastic.\nHoward: Yeah, but they\u2019re so expensive.\nRaj: Oh, come on. You deserve one. You\u2019ve worked hard to find a woman who makes a lot of money.\nHoward: Well, the prices have been coming down.\nRaj: Oh, true. They\u2019re practically giving them away. You know, in exchange for money.\nHoward: And we can make stuff we need for work with it. Prototypes of my CAD/CAM designs, specialized tools\u2026\nRaj: Not to mention Malibu Koothrappali and his totally bitchin\u2019 dream house.\nHoward: We don\u2019t need Malibu Koothrappali\u2019s dream house.\nRaj: Really, smart guy? Where\u2019s he supposed to park his sweet little Corvette?\nScene: The apartment.\nAmy:The monkey in my tobacco study has taken to smoking a pipe. I\u2019m supposed to remove his brain to examine, but it\u2019s hard because now he reminds me of my uncle. You\u2019ve been awfully quiet tonight. Is everything okay?\nSheldon: I\u2019m fine.\nAmy: All right, well, how was work today? Did you exchange your research with Kripke?\nSheldon: Yes.\nAmy: Sheldon, what\u2019s going on?\nSheldon: I read his research, and, it\u2019s leaps and bounds ahead of mine. Which means the mommy of the smartest physicist at the university is not my mommy as I had thought. It\u2019s his mommy.\nAmy: Sheldon, I wish there was something I could do to make you feel better. May I offer you a consoling hug?\nSheldon: What do we have to lose?\nAmy: How\u2019s that?\nSheldon: I feel like I\u2019m being strangled by a boa constrictor. Why\u2019d you stop?\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: Come on, Sheldon, we\u2019re going to be late.\nSheldon: I can\u2019t go in today. I\u2019m sick.\nLeonard: You\u2019re not sick. You just don\u2019t want to face Kripke.\nSheldon: No, look.\nLeonard: 128.\nSheldon: See?\nLeonard: What did you do, put this in your tea?\nSheldon: Oh, dear. Now I\u2019m not even smarter than you.\nLeonard: Sheldon, Kripke\u2019s not smarter than you. You just got stuck on a wrong path. Happened to Einstein. He got stuck on the unified field theory for decades.\nSheldon: Oh, don\u2019t play the Einstein card. His great breakthroughs happened when no one knew anything. So everything was a great breakthrough.\nLeonard: Sheldon Lee Cooper, I do not have time for this nonsense. Now, go put your clothes on, get in the car, and lets go to work.\nSheldon: All right, geez. What a grouch.\nLeonard: How did I do that? I got to remember how I did that.\nScene: Howard\u2019s lab.\nHoward: Do you realize, by owning a 3-D printer, we are reclaiming the manufacturing process and taking jobs back from sweatshops in China?\nRaj: I think this thing was made in China.\nHoward: Eh, what can you do?\nRaj: Ooh, I, I think it\u2019s done. Oh, it worked. We printed a whistle.\nHoward: Amazing. You realize these things go for 25 cents a pop at a party store.\nRaj: And we made it in only three hours. Sounds just like store-bought.\nHoward: Okay, give me a superhero pose, and I will scan you into the computer for your action figure.\nRaj: Oh, I wish I was in better shape.\nHoward: Stop holding your stomach in. I\u2019ll give you a six-pack with the computer.\nRaj: Oh, okay, great. Now I can look like Val Kilmer as Batman instead of Val Kilmer as he looks today.\nHoward: All right, you can suck it in a little bit.\nScene: Sheldon\u2019s office.\nKripke: Cooper, we have a pwobwem. Your work is weawy not at a wevew I expected it to be.\nSheldon: I know. Go ahead, mock me. Just use small words so I understand.\nKripke: Don\u2019t pway dumb with me. We both know what your pwobwem is.\nSheldon: We do?\nKripke: You have a girlfwiend.\nSheldon: So?\nKripke: So my work would suffew, too, if I was getting waid all the time.\nSheldon: Yes. That is the reason. My work is suffering because of all the laid I\u2019m getting.\nKripke: You wucky bastard.\nSheldon: What can I say, you know? She enjoys my genitals. I am giving them to her on a nightly basis.\nKripke: Okay, stop bwagging. You had some bwiwiant insights in here, but if we\u2019re gonna make this work, you need to buckew down and focus.\nSheldon: I\u2019ll do what I can. But it\u2019s not going to be easy, because when I\u2019m with Amy and our bathing suit areas mush together, boy howdy, is it magic\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s apartment.\nHoward: Oh, good, you\u2019re home. Got a little surprise for you.\nBernadette: What?\nHoward: Say hello to my little friend.\nBernadette: Oh, my God. That\u2019s so cute. I didn\u2019t think there could be a smaller version of you.\nHoward: I know, right? And, thanks to photographs and a little 3-D modeling, here comes the bride.\nBernadette: Oh, Howie, I love these.\nHoward: I thought you might.\nBernadette: Were they expensive?\nHoward: Didn\u2019t cost a thing. I made them myself.\nBernadette: How?\nHoward: Koothrappali and I bought a used 3-D printer for $5,000.\nBernadette: $5,000 for a couple of dolls? Are you out of your mind?\nHoward: Not just for a couple of dolls. For as many dolls as we want. And whistles.\nBernadette: At any point, did it dawn on you to talk to me about spending this kind of money?\nHoward: It\u2019s kind of dawning on me now.\nBernadette: I don\u2019t believe you. Howie, we can\u2019t afford to waste money on junk like this.\nHoward: What are you talking about? We make plenty of money.\nBernadette: I make plenty of money. You make peanuts.\nHoward: Yes, but we\u2019re married now. That means, when you get sick, I take care of you. And when you make a bunch of money, I get to buy stuff. Sorry if you don\u2019t like it, but that\u2019s how love works.\nBernadette: No, here\u2019s how love works. You\u2019re gonna return the machine, or you can print out a working set of lady parts and sleep with those. Oh, my God! Are you actually thinking about it?\nScene: The apartment.\nPenny: All right, I don\u2019t understand. Why didn\u2019t you just tell Kripke the truth?\nSheldon: Because the truth made me look bad, whereas a ridiculous bald-faced lie makes me look good. Anyway, if Kripke asks, tell him my coitus with Amy is frequent, intense and whimsically inventive.\nLeonard: Is my coitus whimsically inventive?\nPenny: That is what I write on the bathroom walls. For a whimsically inventive time, call Leonard Hofstadter.\nLeonard: I know you\u2019re joking, but I\u2019d be okay with that.\nPenny: Yeah. Sheldon, can I ask you a question?\nSheldon: Of course.\nPenny: You ever going to sleep with Amy?\nSheldon: That\u2019s awfully personal.\nLeonard: We don\u2019t ask Sheldon things like that.\nPenny: Maybe you don\u2019t, I do. What\u2019s the deal?\nSheldon: Well, word around the university is I\u2019m giving her sex organs a proper jostling.\nPenny: All right, come on, be serious. Look, you guys have been going out a long time. She would clearly like to have a physical relationship with you, so what are you doing?\nLeonard: All right, we\u2019re down the rabbit hole. What are you doing?\nSheldon: Well, first of all, I\u2019m quite fond of Amy.\nPenny: Then what\u2019s the problem?\nSheldon: Penny, all my life, I have been uncomfortable with the sort of physical contact that comes easily to others, hand-shaking, hugging, prostate exams. But I\u2019m working on it, you know? Just recently, I had to put VapoRub on Amy\u2019s chest. A year ago, that would have been unthinkable.\nLeonard: Now you know how I feel when I have to put it on you.\nPenny: Okay. Hang on. Are you saying someday you and Amy might actually get physical?\nSheldon: It\u2019s a possibility.\nPenny (under breath while hitting Leonard): Oh, my God! (Out loud) Sheldon, I know this wasn\u2019t easy for you, and I\u2019m really glad we could have this conversation.\nSheldon: Fine.\nPenny (under breath while hitting Leonard): Oh, my God!\nLeonard: Ow!\nScene: The cafeteria.\nRaj: Are you sure you want to do this? Give up your half of the 3-D printer?\nHoward: Yes. And can you please make that out to Bernadette? I was taken off the joint account until I learn the value of money.\nRaj: Wow, that\u2019s harsh.\nHoward: Tell me about it.\nRaj: Aren\u2019t you gonna eat lunch?\nHoward: Nah, I blew my food allowance on Pokemon cards.\nScene: Sheldon\u2019s office.\nSheldon: Well, the equation balances, but it\u2019s certainly not elegant.\nKripke: Whatever. You get any wast night?\nSheldon: Yes.\nKripke: Gave it to her good, huh?\nSheldon: No, I gave it to her well. Now, over here, I was thinking the turbulence could be reduced if we just put\u2026\nKripke: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Was she naked, or was she weawing wingewie?\nSheldon: I didn\u2019t notice.\nKripke: How could you not notice?\nSheldon: I was too busy squishing all the desirable parts of her body.\nKripke: Ah, you\u2019re kiwing me, Cooper!\nSheldon: Can we get back to work?\nKripke: Sure, sure, sure. You guys ever use any toys?\nSheldon: Toys? I do have a model rocket next to my bed.\nKripke: A wocket? You\u2019we a fweak! I wove it!\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "5_15": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: Leonard\u2019s bedroom. Sheldon enters in a hard hat and high-vis jacket. Sounds a klaxon on his phone.\nLeonard: Aaargh. What the hell?\nSheldon: Emergency preparedness drill.\nLeonard: Oh, no, come on!\nSheldon: Yeah, you know how it works. Once a quarter, keep our readiness up. Now, rise and shine, sleepy head. Half the town is probably dead.\nLeonard: I have to get a lock for my door.\nSheldon: I think you\u2019ll like the drill tonight. I\u2019ve tried to make it fun. Each of these cards contains a detailed scenario of a possible apocalyptic event. Everything from wild fires to a surprise invasion by Canada. Pick a catastrophe, any catastrophe.\nLeonard: Sheldon, Canada is not going to invade California.\nSheldon: Yeah, really? You think those hippies in Washington and Oregon can stop them?\nLeonard: Fine.\nSheldon: All righty! An 8.2 magnitude earthquake devastates Pasadena, reducing mighty edifices to dust, engulfing the city in flames. The streets flow with blood and echo with the cries of the wounded. Oh, excellent choice. Now, put on your hard hat and safety vest.\nLeonard: Oh, fun. I get to spend another night in front of our apartment dressed like one of the Village People.\nSheldon: You make that joke every three months. I still don\u2019t get it. Leonard, wait. What are you doing?\nLeonard: I don\u2019t know, what am I doing?\nSheldon: Look around you, there\u2019s hypothetical broken glass everywhere. Really? You\u2019re going to face Armageddon without your orthotics? All right, your choice. (Grabs him and pushes him over) Uh-oh, hypothetical aftershock!\nLeonard: Aah!\nSheldon: And that\u2019s why we wear hard hats.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The cafeteria.\nHoward: Check it out, press release from NASA.\nRaj: Um, Expedition 31 will launch this spring to the International Space Station. Crew members will include Commander Tom \u2018Tombo\u2019 Johnson, astronaut Mike \u2018Supernova\u2019 Novacelik and Payload Specialist Howard Wolowitz.\nHoward: This is going right into my synagogue\u2019s newsletter.\nRaj: Dude, if you\u2019re going to be an astronaut, you need to pick a cool nickname.\nHoward: I don\u2019t get to pick it. The other guys have to give it to me.\nRaj: Oh. If I had one, it would be Brown Dynamite.\nHoward: Are you not listening to me? The other astronauts have to give you your nickname.\nRaj: Are you not looking at me? I am Brown Dynamite. Why do you put six sugars in your coffee?\nLeonard: Because the cafeteria doesn\u2019t offer little packets of methamphetamine.\nHoward: Emergency drill night last night, huh?\nLeonard: Uh-huh.\nRaj: How\u2019d you do?\nSheldon: I\u2019ll tell you exactly how he did. Readiness: unsatisfactory. Follows direction: barely. Attitude: a little too much. Overall: not only will he probably die in a fiery inferno, his incessant whining would most certainly spoil everyone else\u2019s day.\nLeonard: You know what, I\u2019m so tired I can\u2019t even think straight. I\u2019m going home. Will one of you guys give this nutbag a ride back later?\nSheldon: You can\u2019t go home. You have to take me to the dentist at four o\u2019clock.\nLeonard: Oh, can\u2019t you take the bus to the dentist?\nSheldon: Of course I can. It\u2019s coming back under the residual effects of the anaesthesia, that\u2019s the problem. Two years ago after a deep gum cleaning, I thought I got on a bus but somehow wound up on a booze cruise to Mexico.\nRaj: They put you under for a cleaning?\nSheldon: Yeah, they have to, I\u2019m a biter.\nLeonard: Whatever, Sheldon. I\u2019m exhausted. I\u2019m not taking you to the dentist.\nSheldon: Wrong, sir. Wrong. Under section 37B of the roommate agreement, miscellaneous duties, you are obligated to take me to the dentist. See? It\u2019s right here after providing a confirmation sniff on questionable dairy products.\u201d\nLeonard: You know what, I am sick of the roommate agreement. It\u2019s ridiculous. I\u2019m your roommate, not your chauffeur. You know, I had better things to do yesterday than drive you all the way to the good model train store in Garden Grove because the one in Pasadena has gotten too big for its britches.\nSheldon: Well, it has. Ask anybody.\nLeonard: I don\u2019t care. I\u2019m done.\nSheldon: Hold on. Are you saying that you want to invoke Clause 209?\nLeonard: I don\u2019t know what that is, but if it means I can go home and sleep, then yes.\nSheldon: Think carefully here. Clause 209 suspends our friendship, and strips down the roommate agreement to its bare essentials. Our responsibilities toward each other would only be rent, utilities and a perfunctory chin jut of recognition as we pass in the hall. (Demonstrating) \u2018Sup?\nLeonard: Where do I sign?\nSheldon: Right here. Use your finger.\nLeonard: There. Done.\nSheldon: All right. That\u2019s it. We are now no longer companions, boon or otherwise. We are now merely acquaintances. To amend the words of Toy Story, you have not got a friend in me.\nLeonard: I\u2019m gonna go home and take a nap.\nSheldon: Yeah, well, tell it to someone who cares.\nScene: The apartment.\nHoward: I got pretty exciting NASA news today. Next week I fly to Houston for orientation and zero-gravity elimination drills.\nPenny: What does that mean?\nBernadette: He\u2019s gonna learn to poop in space.\nHoward: Open the pod bay doors, HAL.\nRaj: Maybe your nickname should be Brown Dynamite.\nSheldon: Hello, dear friends. And Dr. Hofstadter.\nLeonard: \u2018Sup?\nSheldon: \u2018Sup? My apologies. I would\u2019ve been here sooner, but the bus kept stopping for other people to get on it.\nAmy: I saved you a dumpling.\nSheldon: Oh, your concern for me is touching. It will serve you well when you take me to the dentist tomorrow.\nAmy: I\u2019m sorry, Sheldon, I\u2019m busy. I\u2019m right in the middle of my addiction study. I\u2019ve got a lab full of alcoholic monkeys, and tomorrow\u2019s the day we switch them to O\u2019Doul\u2019s.\nSheldon: You\u2019re my girlfriend and you\u2019re not going to cater to my every need? Oh, where\u2019d the magic go?\nPenny: Sheldon, that\u2019s not what girlfriends are for. Although, you don\u2019t use them for what they\u2019re for, so what do I know?\nBernadette: Howard doesn\u2019t make me do his shopping, or take him to the dentist, or pick up his dry cleaning, right?\nHoward: Absolutely. But when Ma\u2019s hips give out, you\u2019re up, kid.\nSheldon: Well, if Amy\u2019s too busy, that gives the rest of you an opportunity to make my life easier, thus assuring yourselves a footnote in my memoirs, tentatively entitled You\u2019re Welcome, Mankind. All right, then, just shout when you hear the task you want to undertake. Uh, dentist. Okay, we can circle back to that one. Um, well, who wants to take me Wednesday morning to get new heels put on my dress shoes? Anyone? Oh. That one had hoot written all over it. Um, all right, uh, dermatologist? Allergist? Podiatrist? Supercuts? Okay, okay, here\u2019s a fun one. Um, I need a new picture frame and I have a hankering for Swedish meatballs. Who wants to spend the day with me at IKEA?\nRaj: Their meatballs are pretty good.\nSheldon: What\u2019s that?\nRaj: Nothing, nothing.\nScene: The comic book store.\nSheldon: Hello, Stuart.\nStuart: Oh, hey, Sheldon. Can I help you find something today?\nSheldon: No, no. I was just sitting at home thinking about how it might be nice to catch up with my ninth favourite person.\nStuart: Ninth?\nSheldon: You moved up one. My pen pal in Somalia was kidnapped by pirates. So, uh, how are you?\nStuart: Uh, not so good. My shrink just killed himself and blamed me in the note.\nSheldon: Great. Great. So, what\u2019s new with your family? How\u2019s your mother? Is she alive?\nStuart: Yeah.\nSheldon: And your father? Alive?\nStuart: Yes.\nSheldon: How about your grandparents, they alive?\nStuart: No.\nSheldon: Oh, I\u2019m so sorry for your loss. On a cheerier note, I have a teeth-cleaning appointment this afternoon. What do you say you take me over there, buddy boy?\nStuart: I\u2019m sorry, you want me to take you to the dentist?\nSheldon: Yes. And now, I can\u2019t make any promises, but that\u2019s the sort of thing that gets a fella on the short list for the number eight friend slot.\nStuart: Sheldon, I\u2019m working. I can\u2019t take you to the dentist. Also, and I can\u2019t stress this enough, I don\u2019t want to take you to the dentist.\nSheldon: Can\u2019t help a friend out in a time of need, huh? I see where your therapist was coming from.\nScene: The apartment.\nRaj: Ooh, ooh! What about we make your astronaut nickname Howard \u201cBuzz\u201d Wolowitz?\nHoward: You can\u2019t do Buzz. Buzz is taken.\nRaj: Buzz Lightyear is not real.\nHoward: No, that\u2019s not what I\u2019m talking about.\nRaj: Well, are you talking about when he thought he was real?\nHoward: No.\nRaj: Okay, um, how about Crash\u201d? Howard \u201cCrash\u201d Wolowitz.\nHoward: Yeah, terrific. The other astronauts would love to go hurtling through space with a guy named Crash.\nRaj: All right, um, how about, oh, how about Rocket Man?\nLeonard: That\u2019s not bad, Howard \u201cRocket Man\u201d Wolowitz.\nHoward: Yeah, it\u2019s great, but I told you, I don\u2019t get to pick my nickname. It has to come from the other astronauts.\nRaj: Maybe there\u2019s a way to get them to come up with it.\nHoward: Like how?\nLeonard: Once I tried carrying around a Duncan yo-yo, hoping the other kids would start calling me Duncan.\nHoward: Did it work?\nLeonard: No, they ended up calling me Sock Mouth. Because they took away my yo-yo and stuffed their socks in my mouth.\nRaj: Okay, uh, what if we make Rocket Man your ringtone, and the next time you talk to those guys, I\u2019ll call you and they\u2019ll hear it. Plant the seed.\nHoward: That\u2019s actually not a terrible plan.\nRaj: They don\u2019t call me Brown Dynamite for nothing.\nLeonard (to Sheldon, entering): \u2018Sup?\nSheldon: \u2018Sup?\nLeonard: Hey, did you ever make it to the dentist?\nSheldon: Not necessary. No. I found a service that\u2019ll send a van to your house for a teeth cleaning. Mostly they cater to dogs, but the fellow on the phone seemed to have an open mind.\nLeonard: All right, Sheldon, if you need me to take you to the dentist, I will take you to the dentist.\nSheldon: Are you suggesting that you\u2019ve come to your senses and wish to re-establish the mutual benefits that stem from full participation in the roommate agreement?\nLeonard: Absolutely. If you admit that you\u2019re a 30-year-old man who\u2019s incapable of functioning on his own.\nRaj: Ooh, Sock Mouth\u2019s got him on the ropes.\nSheldon: I will admit nothing of the sort. And now if you\u2019ll excuse me, I have to call my dentist and see if I can also get my hair shampooed and my nails clipped.\nScene: The apartment. Leonard is watching television. All the power goes off.\nPenny (entering): Oh, good, your power\u2019s out, too.\nLeonard: Why is that good?\nPenny: Because last month, I sent the electric company a Starbucks gift card, an apology note, and a few snapshots of me in a bra.\nSheldon: Power failure. Implementing power-failure protocol.\nLeonard: What happened to all your glow-in-the-dark-emergency-exit stuff you had painted on the floor?\nSheldon: Oh, that was wildly carcinogenic. Anyway, it\u2019s too bad you\u2019re no longer entitled to the full benefits of my friendship, because I happen to be extremely prepared for such an emergency. Please try not to see anything by this light. It\u2019s not for you.\nLeonard: It\u2019s just a blackout, I\u2019m sure the power will be back on soon.\nSheldon: And I\u2019m sure some fool in the Donner party said the snow would stop any day now. I like to think they ate him first.\nPenny: You know, I got some candles in my apartment.\nSheldon: But candles? During a blackout? Are you mad? That\u2019s a fire hazard. No, Pasadena Water and Power recommends the far safer glow stick.\nLeonard (pulling out a toy lightsabre): You call that a glow stick? That is a glow stick. Come on, let\u2019s go.\nSheldon: Before you go, consider this. Not only do I have a deep-cycle marine battery power source which is more than capable of running our entertainment system, I also have all 61 episodes of the BBC series Red Dwarf and Fiddle-Faddle. All yours if you\u2019re willing to reinstate the roommate agreement.\nPenny: I\u2019ve got wine at my place and some bubble wrap we could pop.\nSheldon: Oh, he\u2019ll be back. Wine and a girl in the dark, he\u2019s gonna be bored out of his mind.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment.\nLeonard: To wine and bubble wrap. And to not having to watch Sheldon demonstrate his reverse osmosis machine that converts urine into drinking water.\nPenny: You know, in Girl Scouts, Tammie Dinisha said you could do that with panty hose. Boy, was she wrong. Anyway, you want to make out?\nLeonard: I thought because our relationship\u2019s in a beta test, you wanted to take things slow.\nPenny: Okay. Do you want to make out slow?\nLeonard: I can go so slow it\u2019ll be like there\u2019s a snail in your mouth.\nPenny: Ugh. Well, lucky for you, there\u2019s nothing else to do right now.\nSheldon: Excuse me, Leonard.\nLeonard: Since when don\u2019t you knock? It\u2019s like the only good thing about you.\nSheldon: Social niceties have been suspended, Leonard. We\u2019re in a state of a emergency. The world has descended into darkened turmoil. Lawlessness and savagery are the order of the day.\nLeonard: Fine, what is it?\nSheldon: I\u2019m making s\u2019mores. I wanted to alert you in case you smelled caramelizing marshmallows and thought a nearby candy factory was on fire.\nLeonard: S\u2019mores, huh? Good for you.\nSheldon: Yes, or good for us if you sign here and reinstate the full roommate agreement.\nLeonard: No, thanks. I\u2019m good.\nSheldon: Really? Huh! Okay. In that case, I will have a s\u2019more by myself. And then I\u2019m gonna have s\u2019more. By myself.\nPenny: Aw.\nLeonard: No, don\u2019t aw him. He brought this all on himself.\nPenny: But he\u2019s sad.\nLeonard: No, he\u2019s crazy. Sometimes crazy looks like sad so it\u2019ll suck you back in.\nPenny: I think he misses his little buddy.\nLeonard: Fine. But mark my words, this frustrating, bogus teenage make-out session is not over.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: I thought you said candles were dangerous.\nSheldon: This is a Bunsen burner. I\u2019m a scientist, I know what I\u2019m doing. Oh, drat. (His s\u2019more is on fire. He dunks it in a glass of water.) Aw. It took me a gallon of urine to make that water.\nLeonard: Listen, Sheldon, this is stupid. I don\u2019t see why we can\u2019t be friends. And I\u2019m willing to drive you around and help you out with stuff. I just don\u2019t want to do it because of some silly roommate agreement.\nSheldon: What are you proposing?\nLeonard: That we go back to the way things were. But when I do something for you, you show a little appreciation.\nSheldon: And how would I do that?\nLeonard: You say thank you.\nSheldon: Every time?\nLeonard: It\u2019s not crazy.\nSheldon: Counter-proposal. We reinstate the full roommate agreement with the following addendum, in the spirit of Mother\u2019s Day or Father\u2019s Day, once a year, we set aside day to celebrate all your contributions to my life, both actual and imagined by you. We could call it Leonard\u2019s Day.\nLeonard: I kind of like the sound of that.\nSheldon: Of course you do. It\u2019s about you, like everything else. (Lights come back on) Oh, thank goodness. I don\u2019t think I had it in me to make another glass of water.\nLeonard: So, do I get breakfast in bed on Leonard\u2019s Day?\nSheldon: No.\nLeonard: Can I sit in your spot?\nSheldon: No.\nLeonard: Can I control the thermostat?\nSheldon: No.\nLeonard: Do I get a card?\nSheldon: Of course you get a card. It\u2019s Leonard\u2019s Day.\nPenny: Hey, guys, the building manager said the reason the power went out is someone went down into the basement and just pulled the main breaker switch.\nLeonard: Really. Who do you think did that, Sheldon?\nSheldon: Oh, I don\u2019t know. But whoever that mystery man was, you should be eternally grateful, for without him, there would be no Leonard\u2019s Day.\nPenny: Leonard\u2019s Day?\nSheldon: Oh, no pressure. Just get him a crummy card, you\u2019re good.\nScene: Howard\u2019s bedroom.\nHoward: All right, test my ring tone. That really is a good song.\nRaj: Oh, yeah. There\u2019s a reason he\u2019s Sir Elton John. They don\u2019t make you a knight for writing Wake Me Up Before You Go Go.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Howard, are you coming down for breakfast?\nHoward: Ma, I told you I have a video conference with NASA. I said don\u2019t bother me!\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Oh! Listen to Mr. Big Shot Astronaut.\nHoward: Yes, please listen to Mr. Big Shot Astronaut. Hey, good morning.\nNASA Guy (on skype): Hey, Howard, thanks for getting up so early.\nHoward: No problem, Dr. Massimino.\nDr Massimino: The guys here call me Mass.\nHoward: Mass. That\u2019s a cool nickname. \u2018Cause force equals mass times acceleration.\nMass: Yeah. It\u2019s just short for Massimino. Anyway, the plan for this morning is to go over the\u2026\nHoward: Sorry. My phone.\nMass: What is that? Is that Rocket Man?\nHoward: Yeah, my ring tone. Kind of my favourite song, Rocket Man.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Howard, your Fruit Loops are getting soggy!\nHoward: Not now!\nMass: Who\u2019s that?\nHoward: My mom. Sorry.\nHoward: No problem, Fruit Loops.\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "2_16": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The paintball range.\nHoward: That was close.\nRaj: God, I love the smell of paintballs in the morning.\nHoward: Yeah, still funny, Raj.\nLeonard: There\u2019s no way we can get to the ridge. The Chemistry Department has us completely cut off.\nHoward: But what about the creek bed?\nSheldon: The Pharmacology Department controls that, and they\u2019re all hopped up on experimental steroids.\nRaj: Well, that\u2019s it then, we\u2019re doomed.\nSheldon: I think the time has come to acknowledge that we are paying the price for some of us failing to attend my Physics Department paintball strategy meeting.\nHoward: I told you my mom has spider veins, I had to take her to the laser clinic.\nSheldon: And I told you I wanted to see a doctor\u2019s note.\nRaj: We need a plan. How about Operation Hammer of the Gods?\nLeonard: I forget. Which one is Hammer of the Gods?\nRaj: We hide behind the Dumpsters in the parking lot and ambush people when they come to pee.\nHoward: No go. The Dumpsters are deep in Astronomy Department territory.\nLeonard: No, that shouldn\u2019t be a problem, Venus is up during the day. They\u2019re probably just all staring at the sky.\nSheldon: All right, what we need now is a tactical retreat. Did you see the episode of Stargate where they found themselves on a planet with a culture based loosely on Earth\u2019s Athens and Sparta? Not important. Leonard, Raj and I are going to burst out the door and run away, Howard will cover us.\nHoward: Why don\u2019t I run away and you cover me?\nSheldon: Because you chose your mother\u2019s veins over victory. On three. One, two, three, go!\nHoward: I had to take her! It\u2019s almost bathing suit weather!(Another player bursts through the door)\nI surrender! Don\u2019t shoot! They went that way!\nLeslie: Howard, I\u2019m on your team.\nHoward: Oh, Leslie, thank God.\nLeslie: Where\u2019s the rest of your squad?\nHoward: Ah, they left me here to die. What about yours?\nLeslie: Dead, all of them.\nHoward: Sorry.\nLeslie: Don\u2019t be. It was friendly fire. They just wouldn\u2019t listen.\nHoward: Well, we\u2019re surrounded, so I guess there\u2019s nothing for us to do but wait to be captured or killed.\nLeslie: Hmm, that\u2019s the worst part, the waiting.\nHoward: All the while knowing that there\u2019s a paint pellet out there with your name on it.\nLeslie: Yeah, the big wet ball of death. Kind of makes you feel more alive, doesn\u2019t it?\nHoward: It kind of does.\nLeslie: I say we make every moment count.\nHoward: I agree. How exactly do we do that? (Leslie kisses him)\nLeonard (voice): Howard, why aren\u2019t you covering us? We\u2019re getting slaughtered out here!\nHoward: War is hell.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The university cafeteria.\nRaj: Did you guys see the new budget memo that went out this morning?\nLeonard: Yeah, more cutbacks.\nSheldon: Unacceptable. It baffles me why they don\u2019t simply let some of you go so that there\u2019s money available for my research.\nLeonard: You know what baffles me, Sheldon?\nSheldon: Based on your academic record, any number of things, I would imagine.\nLeslie: Hey, guys.\nLeonard: Hey, Leslie.\nHoward: Hey.\nLeslie: Howard, I got the approval for the rapid prototyper you wanted.\nHoward: That\u2019s great, Leslie. Thanks.\nLeslie: You scratch my back, I scratch yours. Rawr.\nRaj: What was all that about?\nHoward: Oh, uh, no big deal. They gave Leslie control of some unrestricted grant money.\nLeonard: Yeah, okay, but what\u2019s with the back-scratching and the meow!\nSheldon: I believe the back-scratching metaphor generally describes a quid pro quo situation where one party provides goods or services to the second party in compensation for a similar action.\nLeonard: Thank you.\nSheldon: The mrow, that sounded to me like an African civet cat.\nLeonard: Are you done?\nSheldon: No. Despite what the name suggests, the civet cat is not a true cat. Now I\u2019m done.\nRaj: You know what I\u2019m thinking? I\u2019m thinking Howard wasn\u2019t making a back-scratching metaphor. I\u2019m thinking there was some actual scratching involved.\nLeonard: What about it, Howard?\nHoward: Okay, I didn\u2019t want to say anything \u2019cause I know you and Leslie have a little history.\nLeonard: I don\u2019t care about that.\nHoward: Great, \u2019cause I\u2019ve been dying to say something.\nLeonard: You and Leslie?\nHoward: In the paintball shed! Twice!\nSheldon: Is that why you didn\u2019t cover our escape and let us get cut down like animals?\nHoward: Oh, yeah, sorry about that.\nSheldon: My good man, dereliction of duty in the face of the enemy is a court-martial offense.\nHoward: Court-martial, schmort-martial, Leslie Winkle is the fifth girl I\u2019ve ever had sex with. I mean, for free.\nRaj: And plus, you got a rapid prototyper. That\u2019s an expensive piece of equipment, dude.\nLeonard: And the rest of us have had our budgets cut to the bone.\nHoward: Okay, one way to look at this is that I\u2019m getting new equipment, and you\u2019re not, and that\u2019s unfair. But a better way to look at this is that I\u2019m getting sex and you\u2019re not, and that\u2019s delightful.\nScene: The apartment. Leonard is looking at Penny\u2019s laptop.\nPenny: The whole thing froze. I don\u2019t know what happened.\nLeonard: Calm down. We\u2019ll figure it out.\nPenny: How can I calm down? I\u2019m gonna lose my whole shopping cart. That\u2019s three hours of picking out shoes just shot to hell.\nSheldon: Hello, Penny.\nPenny: Hello, Sheldon.\nSheldon: You\u2019re in my spot.\nPenny: Are you planning on sitting here?\nSheldon: No, I\u2019m going to the comic book store.\nPenny: Then what difference does it make?\nSheldon: What difference does it make?\nLeonard: Here we go.\nSheldon: That is my spot. In an ever-changing world, it is a single point of consistency. If my life were expressed as a function on a four-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system, that spot at the moment I first sat on it would be zero-zero-zero-zero.\nPenny: What?\nLeonard: Don\u2019t sit in his spot.\nPenny: Fine. (Moves)  Happy?\nSheldon: I\u2019m not unhappy.\nPenny: Boy, I love him, but he is one serious wackadoodle.\nLeonard: Okay, that should do it.\nPenny: Oh, thank you. You are a lifesaver.\nLeonard: That\u2019s a lot of shoes you ordered.\nPenny: Yeah, you know the sad thing is, it\u2019s really not. Ooh, is this one of those paintball guns?\nLeonard: Yeah. You ought to come out with us sometime.\nPenny: Oh, no, thanks. I\u2019m from Nebraska. When we shoot things, it\u2019s because we want to eat them or make them leave our boyfriends alone. (Gun goes off and shoots three paint pellets onto Sheldon\u2019s spot.)\nScene: Howard\u2019s bedroom.\nLeslie: Boy, your heart\u2019s racing. I must\u2019ve really gotten you going.\nHoward: Well, it\u2019s partly you, partly my transient idiopathic arrhythmia.\nLeslie: Sexy.\nHoward: Can I assume that you likewise found the experience\u2026\nLeslie: Satisfactory?\nHoward: That wasn\u2019t quite the word I was looking for, but sure, I\u2019ll do this pass-fail.\nLeslie: Hey, are you enjoying that prototyper I got you?\nHoward: Oh, it\u2019s great. Everybody in the Engineering Department is eating their hearts out.\nLeslie: Isn\u2019t it nice when your good fortune makes others miserable?\nHoward: You know, most people don\u2019t get that.\nHoward\u2019s Mother (voice): Howard, I\u2019m home!\nHoward: Oh, great.\nHoward\u2019s Mother (voice): Book club was cancelled! That thing on Phyllis\u2019s neck opened up again!\nHoward: I\u2019m busy, Ma!\nHoward\u2019s Mother (voice): Too busy to help your mother with her zipper?\nHoward: Don\u2019t come in, Ma!\nHoward\u2019s Mother (voice): Why not?\nLeslie: He\u2019s got company!\nHoward: Oh, there\u2019s the arrhythmia.\nHoward\u2019s Mother (voice): Is she Jewish?\nHoward: Are you Jewish?\nLeslie: No.\nHoward: Yes!\nHoward\u2019s Mother (voice): Okay, then you kids have fun! Use protection!\nScene: The apartment. Leonard is trying to wash the paint off Sheldon\u2019s seat.\nPenny: You think he\u2019ll notice?\nLeonard: There\u2019s a chance.\nPenny: Oh, what are we gonna do?\nLeonard: We? No, no, no, you had your chance to be we for, like, a year and a half now. Right now, you are you, and you are screwed.\nPenny: Why do we have to tell him I did it?\nLeonard: Well, we\u2019re not gonna tell him I did it.\nPenny: Okay, okay, how about this? We tell him somebody broke in.\nLeonard: Just to shoot the couch with a paintball gun?\nPenny: I\u2019m sorry, I buy it. All those people are on drugs.\nLeonard: We could tell him they wanted the couch to stay away from their boyfriend.\nPenny: Okay, fine. Well, what if we just flip it over? There. Looks fine, right?\nLeonard: Mm, butt print. There\u2019s no discernible butt print.\nPenny: Oh, come on. (Sits and wriggles around) There, butt print.\nLeonard: It\u2019s too small and too perfect.\nPenny: Thank you.\nLeonard: You\u2019re welcome.\nPenny (as Sheldon enters): Shh! Act normal.\nLeonard: Sheldon! How was the comic book store?\nSheldon: Fine. The new issue of Flash is out.\nLeonard: Great, great. Did you walk the whole way? It\u2019s a little chilly.\nSheldon: Koothrappali picked me up.\nLeonard: Isn\u2019t that terrific? He is such a good friend. You know what the best thing about friends is?\nSheldon: They don\u2019t talk incessantly for no particular reason.\nLeonard: No, no, friends forgive the little things.\nPenny: You know, I gotta go home and wash my hair.\nLeonard: Don\u2019t you dare, missy.\nSheldon: Hello, fastest man alive. Want to see me read your entire comic book? Want to see it again? Something\u2019s wrong.\nLeonard: What do you mean?\nSheldon: I\u2019m not sure. It doesn\u2019t feel right.\nLeonard: I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about. Oh, that. Penny did that.\nScene: The same. Everyone is eating. Sheldon is perched on the back of Leonard\u2019s chair. He keeps making moaning noises. Saying \u201cExcuse me\u201d he tries moving back to his spot, but the cushion is not there. He tries perching on the arm in various positions.\nLeonard: Why don\u2019t you just eat in your desk chair?\nSheldon: Why don\u2019t I just eat in my desk chair?\nPenny: Here we go.\nSheldon: That is my desk chair, that is where I work. I don\u2019t eat in my desk chair and I don\u2019t work in my spot. I work in my desk chair and eat in my spot.\nLeonard: Wackadoodle.\nHoward: You know, there\u2019s kind of an obvious solution here. (To Raj) Get up. (Raj does. Howard moves his cushion across to Sheldon\u2019s spot) There. Problem solved. (Raj whispers to him) Nobody cares where you\u2019re going to sit. You\u2019re not crazy.\nSheldon: Excuse me, but the problem is not solved. If your head had been accidentally amputated, and we transplanted a dog\u2019s head in its place, would that be \u201cproblem solved\u201d?\nLeonard: If it were your head, it would be.\nPenny: Sheldon, I am really, really sorry, but it\u2019s only for a week. Can\u2019t you be a little bit flexible? Yeah, sorry. I didn\u2019t really think that through.\nSheldon: You claim it\u2019s going to be a week, but I have no faith in your dry cleaner.\nPenny: Why not?\nSheldon: Did you notice the sign on his counter? He\u2019s not a full-time dry cleaner. He also makes keys.\nLeonard: Oh, for God\u2019s sake, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Focus is important. Was Michael DeBakey a wedding planner in between heart transplants? Did Alexander Fleming moonlight as a hairdresser? \u201cThanks for discovering penicillin, now how about we try a bouffant?\u201d\nHoward (after his phone rings): Ooh, looks like I\u2019m gonna have sex tonight. Hey, baby\u2026\nPenny: His right hand is calling him?\nLeonard: No, it\u2019s Leslie Winkle. It\u2019s a long story.\nHoward: I\u2019ll pick you up in ten minutes. Gentlemen, adieu.\nLeonard: I thought we were going to play Halo tonight.\nHoward: What am I supposed to do, Leonard? There\u2019s a woman out there anxious to have sex with me. You understand, right?\nPenny: No. Not at all.\nHoward: Nevertheless, I must depart. By the way, did I tell you? Leslie pulled some strings and got me on the research trip to Geneva to check out the CERN Supercollider.\nLeonard: That\u2019s not fair. You\u2019re not even a physicist.\nHoward: Okay, there are two ways of looking at this\u2026\nLeonard: Get out.\nHoward: Bye.\nScene: Howard\u2019s bedroom.\nLeslie: You\u2019re improving.\nHoward: Thank you. It helps when I get to practice with a real woman.\nLeslie: Hey, listen. Saturday my sister\u2019s getting married. I.. I want you to come with me. It\u2019s black tie.\nHoward: Yeah, gee, I\u2019d really rather not.\nLeslie: Why not?\nHoward: When I go to weddings, it\u2019s to scam on chunky bridesmaids. I don\u2019t know what I would do with a date.\nLeslie: Oh, all right. I understand.\nHoward: Thanks.\nLeslie: Hey, I\u2019m really sorry about that Geneva trip.\nHoward: What about it?\nLeslie: Oh, didn\u2019t you hear? I had to reduce the number of people going, and you didn\u2019t make the cut.\nHoward: When did that happen?\nLeslie: About 12 seconds ago.\nHoward: Well, hold on. Are you saying if I don\u2019t go to the wedding, I can\u2019t go to Geneva?\nLeslie: Actually, I\u2019m trying not to say it.\nHoward: Okay, I\u2019m sorry, but that makes me a little uncomfortable.\nLeslie: How so?\nHoward: Because it\u2019s like you\u2019re controlling me with new equipment and research trips.\nLeslie: Well, if I weren\u2019t controlling you with new equipment and research trips, then I\u2019d be uncomfortable.\nHoward: How so?\nLeslie: \u2018Cause then we\u2019d be in, like, a real relationship with feelings and all that crap.\nHoward: So, bottom line, I\u2019m just a bought-and-paid-for sex toy.\nLeslie: No. No, not at all. You\u2019re also arm candy. So? What do you think?\nHoward: Hey, Ma, you got to rent me a tux!\nHoward\u2019s Mother (voice): Right now? What kind of sex are you having up there?\nScene: The apartment\nLeonard: Why are you crouching there?\nSheldon: This is my spot. Where else am I supposed to crouch?\nLeonard: I don\u2019t know. Texas?\nPenny (arriving with cushion): Here you go. Fresh from the cleaners, good as new.\nLeonard: Really? Great. Sheldon, look. Good as new.\nSheldon: From that key maker, I highly doubt it.\nPenny: Come on, Sheldon. Just give it a try.\nSheldon: All right.\nPenny: There, nice and comfy cosy. Zero, zero, zero.\nSheldon: There\u2019s one more zero. You forgot the time parameter.\nPenny: Sit on the damn couch.\nSheldon: Nope.\nPenny: What do you mean, nope? What\u2019s wrong with it?\nLeonard: Nothing, it\u2019s what\u2019s wrong with him.\nPenny: It\u2019s exactly the same\u2026\nLeonard: Penny, Penny, I think I know what to do. Sheldon, I have some bad news.\nSheldon: More?\nLeonard: I\u2019m afraid so. You know the cashew chicken I get you Monday nights?\nSheldon: Yes. From Szechuan Palace.\nLeonard: Szechuan Palace closed two years ago.\nSheldon: What? Wh-Where did my cashew chicken come from?\nLeonard: Golden Dragon.\nSheldon: No. No, this isn\u2019t right. Our food always comes in Szechuan Palace containers.\nLeonard: Yeah, well, before they went out of business, I bought 4,000 containers. I keep them in the trunk of my car.\nSheldon: But. Oh, this changes everything.\nLeonard: I thought that might take his mind off the cushion.\nSheldon: What\u2019s real? What isn\u2019t? How can I know?\nPenny: You did make that up, right?\nLeonard: Oh, God, I wish I had.\nSheldon: Leonard?\nLeonard: Yeah, buddy?\nSheldon: I still don\u2019t like this cushion.\nScene: The paint ball range.\nLeonard: Okay, first of all, Penny, thank you for coming.\nPenny: Thanks for the shoes.\nLeonard: Penny is an amazing shot. I think we have a real chance to win this week.\nHoward: What\u2019s the plan?\nLeonard: Okay. Now, we all run out. Sheldon and I will cut to the left behind these trees. Raj, Howard and Leslie flank to the right behind the rocks. Then we\u2019ll all have a great view as Penny runs out and kills everyone else in sight.\nSheldon: Right, just one thing before we start.\nLeonard: What is it, Sheldon? (Sheldon shoots Penny)\nPenny: What the hell?\nSheldon: That was for my cushion.\nLeonard: Sheldon, Penny was our only hope.\nSheldon: I\u2019m sorry, Leonard. But revenge is a dish best served cold.\nPenny: Screw that. (Shoots Sheldon)\nSheldon: She can\u2019t shoot me. She\u2019s dead.\nLeonard: He\u2019s right. You can\u2019t. (Shoots Sheldon)\nSheldon: Well, if we\u2019re going to descend into anarchy (Shoots Leonard)\nHoward: Okay, see you.\nLeonard: Where are you going?\nLeslie: Surrender, then Denny\u2019s.\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "9_19": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The apartment.\nAmy (on Skype): I didn\u2019t understand your e-mail.\nSheldon: Uh, can you repeat that? You\u2019re breaking up.\nAmy: I didn\u2019t understand your e-mail.\nSheldon: Ah. Yeah, I had to get a little creative because the S, R and M keys on my laptop stopped working.\nAmy: Deaw Aby, could you pleathe dwive be to the twain thtow thubtibe tobowow?\nSheldon: So, is that a yes?\nAmy: Sheldon, why don\u2019t you get a new computer?

I can\u2019t read that. The video is failing.\nAmy: Get a new computer.\nSheldon: What?\nAmy: Get a new computer.\nSheldon: What? (Answering phone) Hello?\nAmy (on phone) Get a new computer.\nCredits sequence. \nScene: Howard\u2019s workshop.\nLeonard: This is cool. When was the last time you and I built something together?\nHoward: Scientifically? A little over a year ago. LEGOs? Last week in my room.\nLeonard: If there was a Nobel Prize for Millennium Falcons that fall apart when you pick them up, we\u2019d be set.\nPenny: Hey, guys.\nLeonard: Hey. What are you doing here?\nBernadette: We heard there were some sexy scientists working hard all weekend.\nPenny: Yup, so we brought you some lunch and we are gonna go look for \u2019em.\nLeonard: Soup, sandwiches and emasculation, just like my mom used to make.\nPenny: So, how\u2019s it goin\u2019?\nLeonard: Good. Slow.\nHoward: There\u2019s a lot of tedious setup, but once we get through that it should go quicker.\nPenny: Is there anything we can do to help?\nLeonard: You know what, this part isn\u2019t that technical. You actually could.\nPenny: Wow, really? Called my bluff. All righty then.\nBernadette: Can we really help?\nHoward: While we finish soldering these boards, it\u2019d be great if you guys could wrap these pipe fittings with Teflon tape.\nLeonard: I\u2019ll show you how to do one.\nPenny: Hey, wouldn\u2019t it be funny if after all your years of hard work, I\u2019m the one who makes a scientific breakthrough? He doesn\u2019t think that\u2019s funny.\nScene: The apartment.\nAmy: I got here as quickly as I could.\nSheldon: You\u2019re too late.\nAmy: Sheldon, this is silly.\nSheldon: You got emotional when that lab monkey died.\nAmy: That lab monkey told me he loved me in sign language.\nSheldon: Great. Now I\u2019m gonna have that song in my head all day.\nAmy: Look, I\u2019m, I\u2019m sorry for your loss, but I think I have something that might make you feel better. I got you a new computer.\nSheldon: How could you do that?\nAmy: Do what?\nSheldon: Choosing a new laptop Is an incredibly personal ritual. You have taken away weeks of agonizing thought, tedious research, sleepless nights filled with indecision. I, haven\u2019t I lost enough today?\nAmy: Well, the guy at the store said this one is great.\nSheldon: Oh, oh, the guy. Oh, pardon me. I didn\u2019t realize you\u2019d spoken to the guy. Yeah, tell me, did the guy choose one with a 4K display and a Thunderbolt port?\nAmy: Yes.\nSheldon: Yeah? Did the guy make sure that this has a one terabyte solid-state drive?\nAmy: Yes.\nSheldon: Yeah? Oh, well, was this guy Rick from Computer Solutions on Colorado?\nAmy: Yes.\nSheldon: Yeah, well, he does know his stuff.\nScene: Howard\u2019s workshop.\nLeonard: After you wrap the body in reflective tape, the ends get Teflon tape so we can get a tight seal.\nPenny: Like this?\nLeonard: Yeah, perfect.\nPenny: Oh.\nLeonard: And it helps to have small, delicate fingers. So don\u2019t be discouraged if you can\u2019t do it as fast as me and Howard.\nHoward: I don\u2019t know if we have enough solder to finish these circuit boards.\nLeonard: We had a full spool yesterday.\nHoward: What can I say, I play hard, I solder even harder.\nBernadette: Sometimes he solders at home with his shirt off. It\u2019s like a beer commercial.\nLeonard: Well, we got to make a run to the hardware store.\nPenny: How can you call yourself a scientist and run out of solder?\nLeonard: Well, funny story. So, we have plenty of the 60/40 tin-to-lead ratio solder, but the spools look a lot like the 63/37 tin-to-lead\u2026\nPenny: Honey, honey, honey, let me stop you. That is, is not a funny story.\nHoward: You want to come with us?\nBernadette: I\u2019m kind of getting into the groove here.\nPenny: Yeah, you guys run to the store and let the women handle the science for a change.\nLeonard: Okay. We\u2019ll be back as soon as we can.\nPenny: Okay, so what is solder?\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: I suppose I should set this up. Or would you like to rob me of that, too?\nAmy: Knock it off or I\u2019ll start making W-H sounds for words that just have a W.\nSheldon: You wouldn\u2019t.\nAmy: Whatch me.\nSheldon: Fine. I\u2019m sorry. Thank you for the thoughtful gift. I really do appreciate it. As you know, I had become attached to my old laptop. But I\u2019m sure, in time, that this one will\u2026 Jeepers creepers, that started up fast.\nAmy: I thought you might like it.\nSheldon: Look at the 4K resolution. Next time we Skype, I\u2019m gonna count all those nostril hairs.\nAmy: Or you could just look into my eyes.\nSheldon: But you only have two eyes. You got a lot of nostril hairs.\nAmy: Well, you know, as long as you\u2019re happy.\nSheldon: Oh. I am.\nAmy: And Rick said you could bring in your old one to recycle it.\nSheldon: Oh. Uh, no, no, no, thank you.\nAmy: Oh, but he said you can get store credit.\nSheldon: Well, no, I just, I, I don\u2019t want to recycle it. And I don\u2019t want store credit.\nAmy: But why wouldn\u2019t\u2026\nSheldon: Can we please change the subject?\nAmy: Okay. How \u2019bout we change it to why you\u2019re being weird about this?\nSheldon: I\u2019m not being weird. I, it\u2019s hard to explain.\nAmy: Sheldon, just tell me.\nSheldon: It might be easier to show you.\nAmy: Okay.\nSheldon: We\u2019d have to take your car.\nAmy: All right.\nSheldon: And I\u2019m gonna need you to sign a non-disclosure agreement.\nAmy: Well, I signed one before we slept together. Why not now?\nScene: A street.\nLeonard: Penny says they\u2019re having fun working on the prototype.\nHoward: Remember when her fun was nightclubs and drinking games?\nLeonard: I know. I\u2019m lowering the bar so slowly. This time next year she\u2019ll have a coin collection.\nMan: Excuse me. You guys interested in a free screening of an upcoming movie?\nLeonard: Oh. Sorry, we can\u2019t.\nHoward: Well, hang on. What movie is it?\nMan: Oh, I can\u2019t tell you. But it does star Will Smith.\nHoward: Wait. I bet it\u2019s Suicide Squad. Let\u2019s check it out.\nLeonard: What about the girls?\nHoward: Penny just said they\u2019re having fun. Honestly, you want to wrap tape around a bunch of pipe fittings all afternoon?\nLeonard: Okay, we\u2019ll take \u2019em. But, I swear, if it\u2019s Will Smith in Shark Tale 2, it better be at least as good as the original.\nScene: Howard\u2019s workshop.\nPenny: I mean, it\u2019s crazy, isn\u2019t it? I moved here from Nebraska to be an actress, and now I\u2019m sitting in an engineering lab at Caltech helping to build a prototype for a high-tech guidance system.\nBernadette: It is crazy. It\u2019s also crazy that I\u2019ve made fourteen of these and you\u2019ve made three.\nRaj: Hey. Where are the guys?\nPenny: Oh, they went to the store to get solder, which is metal you melt to make science things.\nBernadette: Since when do you work on weekends?\nRaj: I\u2019m an astrophysicist. The stars don\u2019t take a day off.\nPenny: You were home alone and had no one to play with?\nRaj: Well, the cleaning lady was there, but she doesn\u2019t like me. You need any help?\nBernadette: Not with Lightning McQueen here.\nPenny: I think we\u2019re good.\nRaj: Okay. That\u2019s cool. I guess everybody\u2019s involved in this project but me. So, see ya.\nBernadette: I feel bad. Should we have asked him to stay?\nRaj (from outside): Yes.\nScene: Amy\u2019s car.\nAmy: Will you please tell me where we\u2019re going?\nSheldon: Sorry, you\u2019re on a need-to-know basis.\nAmy: I\u2019m driving the car. I need to know.\nSheldon: Right.\nAmy: So where are we going?\nSheldon: No, I meant turn right, and you missed it. Maybe you do need to know.\nScene: The cinema.\nLeonard: What are we gonna tell the girls?\nHoward: It\u2019s not a problem.\nLeonard: I mean without lying.\nHoward: And now you\u2019ve made it a problem.\nLeonard: Come on. We\u2019re a couple of smart guys. I\u2019m sure we can come up with a way to explain this that doesn\u2019t make us look bad.\nPenny (at Howard\u2019s workshop, reading text): Oh, the boys had to drive all the way to San Bernardino for the solder and got a flat.\nLeonard: They bought it.\nHoward: But we\u2019re gonna have to put the spare on before we go back.\nLeonard: Oh, you\u2019re good at this.\nHoward: Well, I lie a lot.\nMan: Hey, guys, thank you for being a part of our test screening. You\u2019re about to be one of the first audiences to see Suicide Squad.\nLeonard: Hey, you were right.\nHoward: Well, I keep telling you, good things happen to bad people.\nMan: Uh, we\u2019re gonna get started in a couple minutes. Enjoy.\nLeonard: Who are you texting?\nHoward: Raj. He really wants to see this movie.\nLeonard: He\u2019ll never make it in time.\nHoward: I know. I want to make him feel bad.\nLeonard: Ha, ha. Leonard and I are about to see Suicide Squad. Spoiler alert, when I see you I\u2019m gonna spoil it. You\u2019re a good friend.\nRaj (at the workshop): Okay. Would you ladies please leave the room for a moment?\nPenny: Why?\nRaj: I need to rub my genitals on their prototype.\nBernadette: What\u2019s going on?\nRaj: Leonard and Howard don\u2019t have a flat. They went to the movies. Look.\nPenny: Un-freakin\u2019 believable.\nBernadette: Son of a bitch.\nRaj: Oh. You know what? I\u2019m gonna let them know that I\u2019m here with you and that they\u2019re busted.\nPenny: No. You know what? Don\u2019t. Don\u2019t. Let\u2019s let them think they\u2019re getting away with it.\nBernadette: Yeah, let\u2019s see how deep a hole they can dig for themselves.\nPenny: Mm-hmm.\nRaj: Interesting. I mean, it\u2019s not testicles on a cryostat, but I like it.\nScene: A storage facility.\nAmy: Why do you have a storage unit?\nSheldon: Just wait.\nAmy: How long have you had it?\nSheldon: Just wait.\nAmy: Do you want me to hold that computer?\nSheldon: Just wait. You know what? Actually, yes, thank you. Welcome to my Fortress of Shame.\nAmy: I\u2019m sorry. What, what am I looking at?\nSheldon: It\u2019s basically everything I\u2019ve ever owned. Um, every book, every tee shirt, every piece of broken electronics. Just all of it.\nAmy: All of it?\nSheldon: I have a Ziploc bag filled with all my old Ziploc bags.\nAmy: Okay. Well, I would like to tell you that there is nothing here to be ashamed of. So I\u2019m gonna need a minute.\nScene: Howard\u2019s workshop.\nPenny: All right, how are we gonna play this when they return?\nRaj: I know. You guys should totally be making out with me.\nPenny: Sweetie, I know you think jokes like that are funny, but do you really think you could handle making out with both of us?\nRaj: No, ma\u2019am.\nBernadette: Okay. Okay, how about this? They don\u2019t know you\u2019re here with us, so you hide in the closet. When they show up, we\u2019ll hear whatever their dumb story is about where they were, we\u2019ll pretend to believe them and just when they think they got away with it, you jump out.\nPenny: Yeah, that\u2019s pretty good.\nRaj: I love it, I\u2019ll be all like, busted, and they\u2019ll be like, what? And then we\u2019ll all be like, oh yeah. Yeah, I get it. I wouldn\u2019t make out with me, either.\nScene: The storage unit.\nSheldon: In here is every clock radio I\u2019ve ever owned. Calculators, VHS tapes. Yeah. Oh. Sporting equipment.\nAmy: You have sporting equipment?\nSheldon: Well, oh, it\u2019s just a, it\u2019s a, a golf ball that my brother threw at my head. You can still feel the dent. It\u2019s right next to the hockey puck dent.\nAmy: Okay, why do you have a bin of pine cones?\nSheldon: I used to collect them as a child. The spiral of scales open in the Fibonacci sequence. A fact that, when you tell your brother, gets a golf ball thrown at your head.\nAmy: So, why do you feel you need to save these things?\nSheldon: I\u2019d like to say it\u2019s nostalgia, but every time I think of throwing anything away, my ears start to ring, and I get butterflies in my stomach. And then it feels like the butterflies get eaten by rats, and then the, the rats get eaten by\u2026\nAmy: Okay. I get it. I get it.\nSheldon: It ends with dinosaurs. I\u2019m sorry if you think less of me.\nAmy: I don\u2019t.\nSheldon: Really? \u2018Cause every time I come in here, I think less of me.\nAmy: Why?\nSheldon: Because I\u2019m a fraud. No. I purport to be a man of the mind. I\u2019ve been such a, a vocal champion of the singularity, but how can I leave my body behind and become one with the internet when I\u2019ve never even thrown a toothbrush away?\nAmy: It\u2019s okay, Sheldon. You know, I\u2019ve saved a lot of weird things, too.\nSheldon: Like what?\nAmy: Well, um, did you know I have a microscope slide with a little bit of tissue from the first brain I ever dissected?\nSheldon: I have an old teddy bear I secretly wiped my nose on for years.\nAmy: It\u2019s not a contest.\nScene: Howard\u2019s workshop.\nPenny: Okay, here they come.\nBernadette: Go hide.\nRaj: Oh, man, when I come out of the closet, I\u2019m gonna nail those guys. Yeah, I heard it. Shut up.\nLeonard: Hey.\nHoward: Hi.\nPenny: Hey, what\u2019s this?\nLeonard: Listen, we did a stupid thing.\nHoward: We went to a movie and lied about it, but we feel bad and want to make it up to you.\nLeonard: So, these are for you, and if you\u2019re not too mad, we\u2019d love to take you guys to dinner.\nHoward: Yeah. Anywhere you want.\nBernadette: Oh. Well, thank you for being honest.\nPenny: Yeah. You know, I want to be upset, but we did kind of have fun working on the prototype.\nRaj (inside cupboard): Don\u2019t forgive them. Stay mad at them.\nHoward: What is he doing in there?\nRaj: Busting you.\nBernadette: It\u2019s okay. They apologized.\nPenny: Yeah, it\u2019s fine.\nRaj: Well this is kind of anti-climactic.\nHoward: You know what wasn\u2019t anti-climactic? The end of the movie. Get this.\nRaj: No spoilers. No spoilers.\nPenny: And he\u2019s back in the closet.\nHoward: Ready for dinner?\nPenny: Yeah.\nBernadette: Should we invite Raj?\nRaj (in cupboard): Yes.\nScene: The storage unit.\nAmy: So, no one else knows about this?\nSheldon: Only you.\nAmy: Thank you for trusting me.\nSheldon: What good is having a girlfriend if you can\u2019t unload your psychological sewage on her?\nAmy: That\u2019s me, your emotional outhouse. You know, if you ever decide you want to do something about this, I\u2019m, I\u2019m here for you.\nSheldon: Thank you. I wouldn\u2019t even know how to begin.\nAmy: Baby steps, I guess.\nSheldon: I suppose I could try getting rid of the golf ball.\nAmy: Oh. Okay.\nSheldon: I will always have the dent to remember it by.\nAmy: You did it. Do you feel okay?\nSheldon: Actually, yes. I do.\nAmy: Well, I\u2019m proud of you.\nSheldon: Thanks.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: I\u2019m glad I told you about the storage unit.\nAmy: Well, I feel closer to you now.\nSheldon: Oh, I feel closer to you, too. You know, it\u2019s still a couple of hours until my bedtime.\nAmy: What did you have in mind?\nScene: The same, shortly afterwards.\nSheldon: You look amazing. I mean, this resolution is remarkable.\nAmy (on Skype): I really had to go home for this?\nSheldon: Yes, but it\u2019s like you\u2019re right here in the room.\nAmy: And yet, I\u2019m not.\nSheldon: But I feel like I could reach out and touch you.\nAmy: And yet, you can\u2019t.\nSheldon: I know.\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "1_17": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The apartment living room\nSheldon: Wo de zhing shi Sheldon.\nHoward: No, it\u2019s Wo de ming zi shi Sheldon. (Makes a hand movement with every syllable.)\nSheldon: Wo de ming zi shi Sheldon. (Copies hand movements.)\nHoward: What\u2019s this? (Repeats hand movements.)\nSheldon: That\u2019s what you did. I assumed as in a number of languages that the gesture was part of the phrase.\nHoward: Well it\u2019s not.\nSheldon: How am I supposed to know that? As the teacher it\u2019s your obligation to separate your personal idiosyncrasies from the subject matter. \nHoward: You know, I\u2019m really glad you decided to learn Mandarin.\nSheldon: Why?\nHoward: Once you\u2019re fluent you\u2019ll have a billion more people to annoy instead of me. \nLeonard (entering): Hey! \nSheldon: Mai du lui tsa.\nHoward: You just called Leonard a syphilitic donkey. \nSheldon: My apologies Leonard, I\u2019m only as good as my teacher. \nLeonard: Why are you learning Chinese?\nSheldon: I believe the Szechuan Palace has been passing off orange chicken as tangerine chicken and I intend to confront them. \nLeonard: If I were you, I\u2019d be more concerned by what they\u2019re passing off as chicken. \nPenny (storming in): I need to use your window.\nLeonard: Oh, yeah, no, sure, go ahead. \nPenny (opening window): Hey Jerkface, you forgot your iPod! (Throws it out.)\nLeonard: What\u2019s going on?\nPenny: Oh, I\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s going on, that stupid self-centred bastard wrote about our sex life in his blog. (Out of window) Drop dead, you stupid self-centred bastard! (To Leonard) Thank you. (exit)\nSheldon: Okay, where were we? \nHoward: Not now, I have a blog to find. \n(Credits sequence)\nScene: Leonard approaches Penny\u2019s door and knocks. \nLeonard: Penny, are you okay?\nPenny (voice off): I\u2019m fine, Leonard, just go away.\nLeonard: Look, I understand that breaking up with someone can be very painful\u2026.\nPenny: GO AWAY!\nLeonard: Okay, feel better, bye. (Goes back to apartment) She doesn\u2019t want to talk. \nSheldon: Not surprising. Penny\u2019s emotional responses originate from the primitive portion of the brain known as the Amygdala, while speech is centred in the much more recently developed Neocortex. The former can easily overpower the latter giving scientific credence to the notion of being rendered speechless. (Leonard stares at him.) Or maybe she just doesn\u2019t want to talk. \nRaj (entering): Hey, look, I found an iPod. \nHoward: It\u2019s smashed beyond repair, what are you going to do with it?\nRaj: What else? Sell it on ebay as slightly used. \nLeonard: It was Penny\u2019s boyfriend\u2019s, they broke up.\nHoward: Apparently he posted intimate details of their physical relationship on his blog, which I cannot find anywhere. \nLeonard: You know what, I\u2019m going to go back and try talking to her again.\nHoward: Good idea. Sit with her, hold her, comfort her, and if the moment feels right, see if you can cop a feel. \nLeonard: I\u2019m not going to do that, Howard.\nSheldon: I\u2019m not aware of any social convention that requires you to intervene at all.\nLeonard: What about \u201cdamsel in distress?\u201d\nSheldon: Twelfth century code of chivalry, not exactly current. You\u2019d also have to be knighted for that to apply. \nLeonard: I don\u2019t care. She\u2019s upset, I\u2019m going over there. \nHoward: Remember to sit on your hands a bit so they\u2019re warm. \nLeonard: I\u2019m her friend, I\u2019m not going to take advantage of her vulnerability.\nHoward: What, so you\u2019re saying that if in the depths of despair she throws herself at you and demands you take her, right there, right now, you\u2019ll just walk away?\nLeonard: I said I\u2019m her friend. Not her gay friend. \nScene: Penny\u2019s flat. Penny is eating ice cream from the tub. \nLeonard (knocking and entering): Hey, listen, I know you said that you didn\u2019t want to talk\u2026\nPenny: I don\u2019t. \nLeonard (leaving): Sorry.\nPenny: Wait. \nLeonard: Wait, did you say wait?\nPenny: Tell me the truth. Am I just an idiot who picks giant losers? \nLeonard: No. No. \nPenny: Okay, so I pick good guys, but turn them into losers. \nLeonard: Of course not.\nPenny: Well, it\u2019s got to be one or the other, which is it?\nLeonard: I\u2019m sorry, what were the choices again? \nPenny: I really thought Mike was different, I thought he was sensitive and smart. I mean, not you smart, normal non-freaky smart. \nLeonard: Yeah, no, sure.\nPenny: You know, and then he just goes and has to humiliate me by writing about me on his blog so the entire world can read it.\nLeonard: Actually it\u2019s not all that easy to find. \nPenny: Yeah, really, well my friends at work found it, my sister found it, judging by my email a number of prisoners at the Michigan State Penitentiary found it. \nLeonard: Okay, well, what exactly did this guy write, not that I need to know the details of your sex life, I just thought\u2026. never mind. \nPenny: Nope, you know what, you might as well read it, everybody else has, go ahead. Oh God, I just feel so betrayed and embarrassed. I just want to crawl into a hole and die.\nLeonard: Okay, well, you know, this isn\u2019t that bad. It just paints the picture of a very affectionate woman who\u2019s open to expressing her affection in non traditional locales. \nPenny: Oh God!\nLeonard: Elevators, parks, movie theatres, out of curiosity, is this subway the transportation system or subway the sandwich shop? \nPenny: Sandwich shop.\nLeonard: Doesn\u2019t that violate the health code?\nPenny: No, at the sub shop we were only making out. \nLeonard: Huh. Okay. But my point is that you have absolutely no reason to be embarrassed. \nPenny: Really, do you think I overreacted?\nLeonard: Maybe a little.\nPenny: \u2018Cause I do that, I do overreact. Maybe I should call Mike and apologise.\nLeonard: No. No, no, that, that would be underreacting. He did break the implied confidentiality of the bedroom and, in your case, the elevator, parks and fast food franchise.\nPenny: Yes. You\u2019re right. I should just say I\u2019m done with him. \nLeonard: Yes, you should, go ahead, say it. \nPenny: But I never gave the man a chance to explain. \nLeonard: What is there to explain, it\u2019s all right here, it\u2019s a betrayal. \nPenny: No, you were right the first time, this is a man who loves me, but in his own stupid way he was just trying to show people how he feels. \nLeonard: I\u2019m pretty sure I never said that. \nPenny: No, you did better than that, you helped me see it on my own. \nLeonard: Aw, good for me. Where are you going?\nPenny: I\u2019m going over to Mike\u2019s. Leonard, thank you so much.\nLeonard: Oh, sure. Huh, maybe I am her gay friend. \nScene: The apartment. The guys are playing a board game and eating Chinese food.\nSheldon: Howard, I\u2019m going to need another Mandarin lesson. I obviously didn\u2019t make my point with those people. \nHoward: For God\u2019s sake, Sheldon, if you don\u2019t like the tangerine chicken, don\u2019t order the tangerine chicken.\nSheldon: I like tangerine chicken, I\u2019m not getting tangerine chicken.\nLeonard: Can we please change the subject.\nRaj: Sure. Tell us again how you screwed up and got Penny back together with her old boyfriend.\nLeonard: Just roll the dice. \nRaj (rolls and moves): Enslaved by warlocks, stay here till you roll 2, 4 or 6\u20267\nLeonard: She was mad at him. She was done with him, the relationship was broken beyond repair and I walked over there and I fixed it!\nHoward: Boy, that story gets better every time you hear it. \nSheldon: Actually, I thought the first two renditions were far more compelling. Previously I felt sympathy for the Leonard character, now I just find him to be whiny and annoying. \nLeonard: Just eat your tangerine chicken. \nSheldon: I\u2019d love to, but I don\u2019t have tangerine chicken. \nPenny (storming in): Thank you so much for your stupid advice. (Slams door again.) \nRaj: Incredible. You managed to screw up the screw-up. \nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment.\nLeonard (knocking and entering): I\u2019m back. \nPenny: I\u2019m sorry I yelled at you. It\u2019s not your fault. \nLeonard: What happened?\nPenny: Well, I went over to Mike\u2019s to make up with him.\nLeonard: Yeah, I know, I know that part. \nPenny: But he had already moved on.\nLeonard: Already, that was quick.\nPenny: That\u2019s what I said to the woman who had her legs wrapped around his neck. \nLeonard: Oh, Penny, I am so sorry.\nPenny: How could he do that.\nLeonard: Oh, well, you know, you did throw an 8 gig iPod\u2026 yeah, no, how could he do that. \nPenny: I swear to God, I am done with guys like that. You know, macho, with the perfect body and the hair, and the money.\nLeonard: Yeah, that must get old quick. \nPenny: You know, just once, I would like to go out with someone who is nice, and honest, and who actually cares about me. \nLeonard: What about me?\nPenny: What about you what?\nLeonard: What about if you went out with me?\nPenny: Are you asking me out?\nLeonard: Um\u2026 yes\u2026 I am\u2026 asking you out. \nPenny: Wow.\nLeonard: I was just going off your comment about the nice guy\u2026\nPenny: No, I know, I got that. Yeah, totally.\nLeonard (continuing through Penny): \u2026thing and honest but, it\u2019s no big deal\u2026\nPenny: Yes. \nLeonard: Yes what? \nPenny: Yes, I will go out with you. \nLeonard: Really?\nPenny: Yeah. Why not, I mean, what do I have to lose?\nLeonard: Yeah. That\u2019s the spirit. \nScene: The lobby. Sheldon is listening to an iPod.\nSheldon: Show me your citrus peels. Gei wo kan, ni jud di zi pei. Show me your citrus peels. Gei wo kan, ni jud di zi pei. Show me your\u2026\nPenny (tapping him on the shoulder): Sheldon.\nSheldon (jumping in panic): Aieee ya! Xia si wo le. \nPenny: I\u2019m sorry. Look, do you have a second.\nSheldon: A second what? Pair of underwear? \nPenny: I was just wondering if I could talk to you? It\u2019s about Leonard.\nSheldon: Why me? Why not Koothrappali or Wolowitz?\nPenny: Well, Raj can\u2019t talk to me unless he\u2019s drunk, and Wolowitz is, you know, disgusting. \nSheldon: Yes, I suppose he is. \nPenny: All I\u2019m saying is, you know Leonard the best. \nSheldon: Not necessarily. I\u2019m often surprised by my lack of familiarity with Leonard. Just the other day I discovered, he not only has a loofah, he hides it. Why do you suppose a man would be ashamed of having a loofah? I myself prefer to have my excess epithelial cells slough off naturally, but I don\u2019t condemn those who seek to accelerate the process. \u00a0(Time shift) And until recently I had no idea that despite his lactose intolerance, he can tolerate small amounts of non-fat ice cream without producing a noxious gas that I maintain in the right concentration could be weaponised. (Begins to unlock apartment door.)\nPenny: Leonard might come home, can we talk in my apartment. \nSheldon: We\u2019re not done? \nPenny: No.\nSheldon: Ach, why not? We\u2019re already through the looking glass anyway. \nPenny: Okay, so, here\u2019s the thing. I guess you\u2019re aware that Leonard asked me out. \nSheldon: Well, he didn\u2019t actually say anything, but when he came back to the apartment he was doing a dance that brought to mind the happy hippos in Fantasia. \nPenny: Oh, that\u2019s nice. Anyhow, the thing I wanted to talk to you about is, you know, since Leonard and I have become friends, I was just\u2026 want to sit down? \nSheldon: Oh, I wish it were that simple. You see, I don\u2019t spend much time here and so I\u2019ve never really chosen a place to sit. \nPenny: Well, choose.\nSheldon: There are a number of options and, I\u2019m really not familiar enough with the cushion densities, air flow patterns and dispersion of sunlight to make an informed choice.\nPenny: Alright, why don\u2019t you just pick one at random, and then if you don\u2019t like it you can sit somewhere else next time. \nSheldon: No, no, that\u2019s crazy. You go ahead and talk while I figure it out. \nPenny: Okay. Um, here\u2019s the thing. So, I\u2019ve known for a while now that Leonard has had a little crush on me\u2026\nSheldon: A little crush? Well I suppose so, in the same way Menelaus had a little crush on Helen of Troy. \nPenny: Alright, yeah, I don\u2019t really know who they are\u2026\nSheldon: Well Menelaus was the brother of Agamemnon\u2026\nPenny: Yeah, I don\u2019t care, I don\u2019t care. The point is Leonard isn\u2019t the kind of guy I usually go out with.\nSheldon: Leonard isn\u2019t the kind of guy anyone usually goes out with. Would you be open to rotating the couch clockwise thirty degrees? \nPenny: No. What I\u2019m saying is, Leonard might be different in a good way. Obviously my usual choices have not worked out so well. \nSheldon: The last one worked out well for Koothrappali. He got a free iPod. Oh, glare! \nPenny: But on the other hand, if things don\u2019t go well with Leonard, I risk losing a really good friend. I mean, I guess he\u2019s not looking for a fling, he\u2019s the kind of guy that gets into a relationship for, I don\u2019t know, like you would say light years. \nSheldon: I would not say that. No-one would say that, a light year is a unit of distance, not time. \nPenny: Thank you for the clarification. \nSheldon: Draft. You see people hear the word year and they think duration. Foot pound has the same problem, that\u2019s a unit of work, not of weight.\nPenny: Right, thanks.\nSheldon: It\u2019s a common mistake.\nPenny: Not the first one I\u2019ve made today. \nSheldon: Okay. I think this will be my seat. \nPenny: Sheldon, do you have anything to say that has anything to do with, you know, what I\u2019m talking about. \nSheldon: Well, let\u2019s see. We might consider Schrodinger\u2019s Cat. \nPenny: Schrodinger? Is that the woman in 2A?\nSheldon: No. That\u2019s Mrs Grossinger. And she doesn\u2019t have a cat, she has a Mexican hairless, annoying little animal, yip yip yip yip\u2026\nPenny: Sheldon! \nSheldon: Sorry, you diverted me. Anyway, in 1935, Erwin Schrodinger, in an attempt to explain the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum physics, he proposed an experiment where a cat is placed in a box with a sealed vial of poison that will break open at a random time. Now, since no-one knows when or if the poison has been released, until the box is opened, the cat can be thought of as both alive and dead. \nPenny: I\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t get the point. \nSheldon: Well of course you don\u2019t get it, I haven\u2019t made it yet. You\u2019d have to be psychic to get it, and there\u2019s no such thing as psychic.\nPenny: Sheldon, what\u2019s the point? \nSheldon: Just like Schrodinger\u2019s Cat, your potential relationship with Leonard right now can be thought of as both good and bad. It is only by opening the box that you\u2019ll find out which it is. \nPenny: Okay, so you\u2019re saying I should go out with Leonard. \nSheldon: No, no, no, no, no, no. Let me start again. In 1935, Erwin Schrodinger\u2026\nScene: The University cafeteria.\nLeonard (pointing): Two seats right there. \nSheldon (to two oriental-looking people occupying the other seats): Chong sho sha pwe. (Caption translates to \u201cLong Live Concrete\u201d.) Xie xie. (Thank you) \nLeonard: Sheldon, I think I\u2019ve made a mistake. \nSheldon: I can see that. Unless you\u2019re planning on running a marathon, choosing both stuffing and mashed potatoes is a starch filled redundancy.\nLeonard: No, it\u2019s about Penny.\nSheldon: A mistake involving Penny? Okay, you\u2019ll have to narrow it down. \nLeonard: I don\u2019t think I can go out with her tonight. \nSheldon: Then don\u2019t.\nLeonard: Other people would say \u201cwhy not?\u201d \nSheldon: Other people might be interested. \nLeonard: I\u2019m going to talk anyway.\nSheldon: I assumed you would. \nLeonard: Now that I\u2019m actually about to go out with Penny, I\u2019m not excited, I\u2019m nauseous. \nSheldon: Ah, then your meal choice is appropriate. Starch absorbs fluid which reduces the amount of vomit available for violent expulsion. \nLeonard: Right.\nSheldon: You also made a common grammatical mistake, you said nauseous when you meant nauseated. But go on. \nLeonard: Sheldon, this date is probably my one chance with Penny, what happens if I blow it. \nSheldon: Well, if we accept your premise, and also accept the highly improbable assumption that Penny is the only woman in the world for you then we can logically conclude that the result of blowing it would be that you end up a lonely, bitter old man with no progeny. The image of any number of evil lighthouse keepers from Scooby Doo cartoons comes to mind. \nLeonard: You\u2019re not helping. \nSheldon: Alright, what response on my part would bring this conversation to a speedy conclusion?\nLeonard: Tell me whether or not to go through with the date.\nSheldon: Schrodinger\u2019s Cat.\nLeonard: Wow, that\u2019s brilliant.\nSheldon: You sound surprised. Mmm, hou zi shui zai li du. (Your monkey sleeps inside me.) \nScene: Leonard approaches Penny\u2019s door. He is wearing a suit. He knocks. Penny answers.\nPenny: Hi.\nLeonard: Hi. \nPenny: come on in.\nLeonard: Thank you. You look very nice.\nPenny: Thank you. So do you. \nLeonard: I made an eight o\u2019clock reservation.\nPenny: Okay, great, listen, um, maybe we should talk first. \nLeonard: Oh. Okay. But before you say anything, have you ever heard of Schrodinger\u2019s Cat? \nPenny: Actually, I\u2019ve heard far too much about Schrodinger\u2019s Cat. \nLeonard: Good. (He grabs her and kisses her.) \nPenny: Alright, the cat\u2019s alive, let\u2019s go to dinner. \nScene: The Szechuan Palace. \nSheldon (in Mandarin): Show me your mucus! Your mucus! \nOwner (in Mandarin): Blow your own nose and go away. \nSheldon (in Mandarin): This is not a tangerine bicycle. \nOwner (in English): Crazy man. Call the police. \nSheldon (in Mandarin): No. Don\u2019t call the library. Show me your mucus. (Leonard and Penny are seen entering, and then leaving again quickly.) Oxen are in my bed! Many, many oxen! Oy Vey!\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "5_18": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: A barber\u2019s shop.\nLeonard: I\u2019m just gonna run to the store and get a few things. I\u2019ll pick you up when you\u2019re done.\nSheldon: Okay. I like it a little better when you stay, but all right.\nBarber: Hey, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Hello. I\u2019m here for my haircut with Mr. D\u2019Onofrio.\nBarber: I\u2019m sorry, Uncle Tony\u2019s in the hospital. He\u2019s pretty sick.\nSheldon: Oh, dear, Mr. D\u2019Onofrio\u2019s in the hospital. Why do these things always happen to me?\nBarber: I can cut it for you.\nSheldon: You\u2019re not Mr. D\u2019Onofrio. I get my hair cut by Mr. D\u2019Onofrio. You believe this guy?\nLeonard: Excuse us for a second. Sheldon, it\u2019s okay, he can do it. He\u2019s a barber.\nSheldon: He\u2019s not a barber, he\u2019s the nephew. He\u2019s an example of the kind of nepotism that runs rampant in the barbering industry. Besides, Mr. D\u2019Onofrio knows exactly how I like my hair done because he has all my haircut records from my barber in Texas.\nLeonard: What are you talking about?\nSheldon: When I first moved here I was nervous about finding a new barber, so my mother had all my haircut records sent here to Mr. D\u2019Onofrio.\nLeonard: There\u2019s no such thing as haircut records.\nSheldon: Yes, there are.\nLeonard: Have you ever seen them?\nSheldon: No, but my mother assured me they were sent here, and I\u2019ll bet you dollars to doughnuts that this one doesn\u2019t have them. Uh, excuse me. Do you have access to my haircut records?\nBarber: Your what?\nSheldon: To paraphrase T.S. Eliot, this is the way the world ends, not with a bang but with a nephew.\nLeonard: Sheldon, you\u2019re a grown man, he\u2019s a professional, and your haircut is number three on that poster from 1946. Just sit down and let him do it.\nSheldon: Fine, but if I come out of this looking like a dork, it\u2019s on you. (Sits)\nBarber: So my kid said the funniest thing today.\nSheldon: Nope. (Runs out)\nLeonard: When you tell this story later, the word we usually use is quirky.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Can you pass the Parmesan cheese?\nLeonard: Sure. What are you doing?\nSheldon: I\u2019m trying to get the hair out of my eyes.\nLeonard: Sheldon, you are one day late for your haircut.\nSheldon: Thank you for captioning my nightmare.\nHoward: Lookie here, I got my travel orders.\nRaj: Payload Specialist Howard Wolowitz is requested to report to the NASA Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas, for astronaut training Monday eight a.m.\nHoward: Yeah, but it\u2019s from NASA, so it\u2019s oh eight hundred.\nRaj: But it says eight a.m.\nHoward: You read it as oh eight hundred.\nRaj: It doesn\u2019t have an oh in front of it.\nHoward: You know what does have an oh in front of it? Oh, my God, I\u2019m an astronaut, and you\u2019re dying of jealousy.\nLeonard: So, what kind of things are they\u2026 (to Sheldon) will you stop that?\nSheldon: I can\u2019t help it, I feel like a teen heartthrob.\nPenny: You know, Sheldon, I used to cut my brother\u2019s hair. I could do it for you.\nSheldon: Penny, I know you mean well, offering the skills of the hill folk, but, um, here in town we don\u2019t churn our own butter, we don\u2019t, uh, make dresses out of gunny sacks, and, uh, we sure as shootin\u2019 don\u2019t get our hair cut by bottle-blonde\u2026\nLeonard: Sheldon, be nice.\nSheldon: I\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s the bad boy attitude that comes with this hair.\nRaj: You could go to my guy. He\u2019s at Juan-Juan in Beverly Hills. They bring you a cup of tea, they\u2019ll massage your scalp. It\u2019s about two hundred dollars, but sometimes you look in the next chair and you see a superstar like Tony Danza.\nHoward: Quick question here, have we actually changed the conversation from I\u2019m going\nto astronaut training to Sheldon can\u2019t get a haircut?\nRaj: Now who\u2019s dying of jealousy? Oh, it\u2019s you.\nScene: Amy\u2019s apartment. Amy is playing her harp.\nAmy: I\u2019m a cowboy, on a steel horse I ride. I\u2019m wanted\u2026 I\u2019m wanted\u2026 wanted, dead or alive. Sheldon, you\u2019re ruining girlfriend-boyfriend sing-along night.\nSheldon: I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m looking for a barber and I\u2019m running out of time. My hair is growing at the rate of 4.6 yoctometers per femtosecond. I mean, if you\u2019re quiet, you can hear it.\nAmy: What about Supercuts?\nSheldon: I tried once. They do men\u2019s and women\u2019s hair in the same room at the same time. It\u2019s like Sodom and Gomorrah with mousse.\nAmy: Well, this isn\u2019t a crisis. Why don\u2019t you just let your hair grow out a little?\nSheldon: Why don\u2019t I let my hair grow out? Um, why don\u2019t I start wearing Birkenstocks and, uh, uh, seeking validation of my opinions by asking can you dig it?\nAmy: Well, I don\u2019t know. I think you might look sexy with long hair. The kind that flows down to your shoulders and blows back while riding on a horse, bareback and bare-chested. I\u2019m gonna go brush my teeth, it might take a while.\nScene: Bernadette\u2019s bedroom.\nHoward (on Skype): Hi.\nBernadette: Hi, sweetie.\nHoward: I miss you.\nBernadette: I miss you, too. So tell me all about your first day.\nHoward: Oh, wow, where do I even start? I got to experience zero gravity.\nBernadette: Cool. How do they do that?\nHoward: It\u2019s pretty neat. You get in this plane that goes almost straight up for, like, 20 seconds, and then straight back down like it\u2019s going to crash, and they do it over and over again, you know, no matter how many times you throw up.\nBernadette: You threw up?\nHoward: Yeah, and the craziest part is, because there\u2019s no gravity, the throw-up kind of floats there, in a little ball, and if your mouth is open because you\u2019re screaming, sometimes it just floats right back in. Boy, does everyone laugh at you when that happens.\nBernadette: That sounds mean.\nHoward: No. Yeah, I would have laughed, too, but I didn\u2019t want the vomit to come back out. Anyway, oh, could you do me a favour and overnight me some more underwear?\nBernadette: Sure, why?\nHoward: I got a look at the centrifuge they\u2019re going to spin me around in tomorrow, and I have a hunch I packed a little light.\nScene: A hospital ward.\nSheldon: Mr. D\u2019Onofrio? It\u2019s Sheldon. They didn\u2019t have anything barber-themed in the gift shop, so I got you this. I don\u2019t know if you can read his little T-shirt. It says, um, get well bear-y soon. Trust me, if you were even a little conscious right now, you\u2019d be laughing. Anyway, there\u2019s new studies that show, people in comas are aware of everything going on around them. With that in mind, if you can hear me, move away from the light and toward the sound of these scissors.\nNurse: Can I help you?\nSheldon: Yes. Do you have something I could use as a cape?\nNurse: Oh, dear, did we spit out our pills, slip out of the ninth floor, and go on a little adventure?\nSheldon: Oh, no, no, I\u2019m just here to get my hair cut.\nNurse: I-I see. J-Jus-Just wait here one moment. Security!\nSheldon: I got to run. But not with scissors, that would be unsafe.\nScene: The apartment.\nPenny: So, if I move my horsey here, isn\u2019t that checkmate and I win?\nLeonard: Hmm.\nPenny: Well, is it or isn\u2019t it?\nLeonard: You know, I think this is a good stopping point. Uh, it\u2019s your first real game. I threw a lot of information at you.\nPenny: Well, no, I mean, your king is trapped. He can\u2019t go here because of my lighthouse, and he can\u2019t go here because of my pointy-head guy.\nLeonard: Like I said, complicated game.\nPenny: So did I win or not?\nLeonard: Did you have fun? Because if you had fun, then you are, you are a winner. Now that\u2019s, that-that\u2019s what chess is all about.\nSheldon: Hello.\nLeonard: Hey.\nPenny: Oh, hey. Sorry, Sheldon, I\u2019ll move.\nSheldon: Eh, why? My spot, your spot, what difference does it make?\nPenny: Okay, what just happened?\nLeonard: I don\u2019t know. Between you playing chess like Bobby Fischer and Sheldon being okay with you in his spot, I\u2019m guessing someone went back in time, stepped on a bug, and changed the course of human events.\nPenny: Uh, sweetie, are you all right?\nSheldon: No, I\u2019m not all right. It\u2019s been six days since I was supposed to get a haircut and nothing horrible has happened.\nPenny: Okay, I\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t understand.\nSheldon: Leonard, explain it to her.\nLeonard: Oh, uh, he\u2019s crazy.\nSheldon: I have spent my whole life trying to bring order to the universe by carefully planning every moment of every day. But all my efforts, our dinner schedule, my pyjama rotation, my bowel movement spreadsheet, it\u2019s clear now, I\u2019ve been wasting my time.\nLeonard: Good. I\u2019m taking that disgusting chart off the fridge.\nPenny: You know, Sh-Sheldon, sometimes it\u2019s nice not knowing what\u2019s coming. I mean, look at me and Leonard. We went out, we broke up, now we\u2019re trying again. We don\u2019t know what\u2019s gonna happen.\nSheldon: Oh, please, everyone knows what\u2019s going to happen. But I see your point.\nLeonard: I think this could be good for you. Maybe it\u2019s time for you to shake things up a bit.\nSheldon: You\u2019re right. I should embrace the chaos.\nLeonard: Great. What are you going to do first?\nSheldon: I don\u2019t know. I could do anything. All bets are off. The world is my oyster. I got it. I\u2019m going to put on my Tuesday pyjamas tonight.\nLeonard: I got to tell you, I\u2019m a little worried about him.\nPenny: If I were you, I\u2019d be worried that a girl who\u2019s never played chess in her life just kicked your ass.\nScene: Bernadette\u2019s bedroom.\nHoward (on Skype): Hi.\nBernadette: Howie, what happened to you?\nHoward: We did overnight survival training in the wilderness. Big fun. Big, big fun. I was gonna freshen up for you but I blacked out a little on the way to the bathroom.\nBernadette: Survival training? Is that like camping?\nHoward: Uh-huh. Except you don\u2019t have food or water, and they don\u2019t have a sunset Sabbath service like they do at Camp Hess-Kramer.\nBernadette: Do you sleep in tents?\nHoward: No. I slept in a hole I dug in the ground with my bare hands. And at some point during the night, an armadillo crawled in and spooned me.\nBernadette: Poor baby.\nHoward: But I did it. I survived. I wasn\u2019t sure I was going to when the sandstorm hit. I just pulled my turtleneck up over my head and waited for death. But somehow as I sat there, wrapped in a cocoon of my own neck-sweat, I found that primal part of the human spirit that just wants to keep on living, no matter what the cost.\nBernadette: You\u2019re so brave. I\u2019m proud of you.\nHoward: I ate a butterfly. It was so small and beautiful, but I was so hungry.\nBernadette: Are you crying?\nHoward: No, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible. I\u2019m severely dehydrated. My pee is like toothpaste.\nBernadette: Howie, if you\u2019re not able to do this, come home. It won\u2019t change how I feel about you.\nHoward: Thanks, honey, but I can\u2019t quit. If I do, I\u2019ll just be a guy who had a chance to be an astronaut and gave it up.\nBernadette: Well, is there anything I could do to help?\nHoward: No. Wait. Send more underwear.\nScene: Leonard\u2019s bedroom. Leonard wakes to the sound of bongos.\nLeonard (going to living room): Don\u2019t let this be Sheldon playing bongos. Please don\u2019t let this be Sheldon playing bongos.\nSheldon: Hello, Leonard, do you like my bongos? Bet you didn\u2019t know that I had bongos.\nLeonard: Sheldon, it\u2019s three o\u2019clock in the morning.\nSheldon: Three in the morning is a good time for bongos.\nLeonard: I was sleeping.\nSheldon: Leonard sleeps while I play bongos.\nLeonard: No, he doesn\u2019t.\nSheldon: Leonard no sleep while I play bongos. Bongo solo.\nLeonard: Stop! Stop it! Stop! Stop! Stop it!\nPenny (entering): What the hell?!\nLeonard: Oh, hi, Penny, guess what? Sheldon got bongos.\nPenny: Why did you get bongos?\nSheldon: Richard Feynman played the bongos. I thought I\u2019d give that a try.\nLeonard: Richard Feynman was a famous physicist.\nPenny: Oh, Leonard, it\u2019s three o\u2019clock in the morning. I don\u2019t care if Richard Feynman was a purple leprechaun who lived in my butt.\nSheldon: Penny meant if he were a purple leprechaun. Penny forgot to use the subjunctive.\nLeonard: Sheldon, go to bed. You have work in the morning.\nSheldon: Maybe, maybe not. Maybe tomorrow I start a bongo band and tour the world.\nLeonard: W-w-wuh, no, no, hang on,uh, uh, roommate agreement. No hootenannies, sing-a-longs, or barbershop quartets after ten p.m.\nSheldon: Roommate agreement? Are you kidding? We are living in a world of chaos. Roommate agreement.\nPenny: Where are you going?\nSheldon: Wherever the music takes me, kitten. I play bongos walking down the stairs. (Sound of falling) Oh! Oh! Never play bongos walking down the stairs.\nScene: Howard\u2019s hotel room. There is a knock on the door.\nBernadette: Surprise.\nHoward: What are you doing here?\nBernadette: I\u2019m here to help you get through this. You can\u2019t do it on your own, you need someone to take care of you.\nHoward: Oh, I love you so much.\nBernadette: Oh, I love you.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Howard, your bath is getting cold!\nHoward: Don\u2019t worry, once she falls asleep, I\u2019ll spoon you like an armadillo.\nScene: Amy\u2019s apartment.\nAmy: He showed up in the middle of the night with his bongos. I foolishly thought it was some sort of musical booty call.\nLeonard: Poor guy. He must have been exhausted. Sheldon like to sleep while Leonard play the bongo!\nAmy: That was kind of uncalled for.\nLeonard: No, it was called for.\nSheldon: What\u2019s going on?\nPenny: All right, Sheldon, this craziness has gone on long enough. Please come home so I can cut your hair.\nSheldon: Penny, you\u2019re not trained. You\u2019re not licensed. Most importantly, you don\u2019t have access to my haircut records.\nPenny: All right, honey, look, we\u2019ve known each other for a long time now, right? I\u2019ve taken you to Disneyland, I kicked a bully in the nuts for you, I sing you Soft Kitty when you\u2019re sick, you\u2019ve even saw me naked once.\nLeonard: I\u2019m sorry, duh, what?\nPenny: It was a long story. Anyway, Sheldon, I promise I know what I\u2019m doing. Please let me cut your hair.\nSheldon: Amy, what do you think?\nAmy: There\u2019s not a hair on my body I wouldn\u2019t let this woman trim.\nSheldon: Fine, let\u2019s go. Thank you for letting me sleep on your couch.\nAmy: There\u2019s only so many times a woman can say how about the bed?\nLeonard: What\u2019s this about Sheldon seeing you naked?\nSheldon: Oh, relax. It was just her bottom and her breasts.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment. Penny is cutting Sheldon\u2019s hair.\nPenny: Almost done.\nSheldon: At the end of the haircut, Mr. D\u2019Onofrio would tell me a dirty joke.\nPenny: Well, sorry, I don\u2019t know any dirty jokes.\nSheldon: That\u2019s okay, I never understood them anyway.\nPenny: Okay, what do you think?\nSheldon: Hmm, well, it\u2019s a little Hollywood. But I think I can pull it off. Well done, Penny.\nPenny: Ha, told you. Okay, I\u2019m just gonna clean up your neck a little and then you are good to go.\nSheldon: Fun time. Hah. Sorry, sometimes the clippers tickle me.\nPenny: Okay. (Sheldon laughs and jerks, Penny accidentally shaves a strip up the back of his head) Okay, yep, we\u2019re all done now. It\u2019s just, it\u2019s good. Let me just take that away from you. Okay.\nSgeldon: Thank you very much.\nPenny: You are welcome.

For Vulcans, mating, or, if you will, Pon Farr, it\u2019s an extremely private matter.\nLeonard: Still, I\u2019d like to know the details. His mother was human, his father was Vulcan, they couldn\u2019t just conceive.\nHoward: Maybe they had to go to a clinic.

Fishman, Chen, Chowdry, McNair aren\u2019t fielding a team in the university physics bowl this year. \nLeonard: You\u2019re kidding, why not?\nHoward: They formed a barbershop quartet, and got a gig playing Knotsbury Farm. \nPenny: Wow, so in your world, you\u2019re like, the cool guys. \nHoward: Recognise. \nLeonard: This is our year! With those guys out, the entire physics bowl will kneel before Zod. \nPenny: Zod?\nHoward: Kryptonian villain. Long story.\nRaj: Good story. (Clasps hands to mouth in shock.) \nSheldon: Well count me out.\nHoward: What? Why?\nSheldon: You want me to use my intelligence in a tawdry competition? Would you ask Picasso to play Pictionary? Would you ask Noah Webster to play Boggle? Would you ask Jacques Cousteau to play Go Fish? \nLeonard: Come on, you need a four person team, we\u2019re four people. \nSheldon: By that reasoning we should also play bridge, hold up a chuppah and enter the Olympic bobsled competition.\nPenny: I want tickets to that please. \nLeonard: Sheldon, what, do I need to quote Spock\u2019s dying words to you.\nSheldon: No, don\u2019t. \nLeonard: The needs of the many.\nHoward: Outweigh the needs of the few. \nSheldon: Or the one. Dammit, I\u2019ll do it. \nCredits sequence\nScene: The cafeteria.\nRaj: Okay. First order of physics bowl business. We need a truly kick-ass team name. Suggestions.\nHoward: How about the perpetual motion squad? It\u2019s beyond the laws of physics, plus a little heads up for the ladies. \nLeonard: The ladies?\nHoward: Perpetual motion squad, we can go all night.\nRaj: I like it.\nSheldon: I don\u2019t. Teams are traditionally named after fierce creatures, thus intimidating ones opponent.\nRaj: Then we can be the Bengal Tigers.\nSheldon: Poor choice. Gram for gram, no animal exceeds the relative fighting strength of the army ant. \nRaj: Maybe so. But you can\u2019t incinerate a Bengal Tiger with a magnifying glass. \nLeonard: Let\u2019s put it to a vote. All those in favour\u2026.\nSheldon: Point of order. I move that any vote on team names should be unanimous. No man should be forced to emblazon his chest with the bengal tiger, when common sense dictates it should be an army ant. \nLeonard: Will the gentleman from the great state of denial yield for a question? \nSheldon: I will yield.\nLeonard: After we go through the exercise of an annoying series of votes, all of which the gentleman will lose, does he then intend to threaten to quit if he does not get his way?\nSheldon: He does. \nLeonard: I move we are the Army Ants, all those in favour?\nScene: The apartment.\nPenny: Good afternoon, and welcome to today\u2019s physics bowl practice round. I\u2019m Penny, and I\u2019ll be your host, because apparently I didn\u2019t have anything else to do on a Saturday afternoon, and isn\u2019t that just a little sad?

(Raj puts his thumb up.)\nPenny: You know, it\u2019s none of my business, but isn\u2019t a guy who can\u2019t speak in front of women going to hold you back a little?\nLeonard: Oh, uh, he\u2019ll be okay once the women are mixed into the crowd. He only has a problem when they\u2019re one on one and smell nice.\nPenny: Oh, thanks Raj, it\u2019s vanilla oil.\nLeonard: I was actually the one who noticed, okay, let\u2019s just start. \nPenny: Okay, the first question is on the topic of optics. What is the shortest light pulse ever produced? Dr Cooper.\nSheldon: And of course, the answer is 130 adoseconds.\nPenny: That is correct.\nLeonard: I knew that too.\nPenny: Good for you, sweetie. Okay, next question. What is the quantum mechanical effect used to encode data on hard disk drives? Howard.\nSheldon: And of course, the answer is giant magneto resistance.\nPenny: Right. \nHoward: Hey, I buzzed in. \nSheldon: But I answered, it\u2019s called teamwork. \nHoward: Don\u2019t you think I should answer the engineering questions? I am an engineer.\nSheldon: By that logic I should answer all the anthropology questions because I\u2019m a mammal.\u00a0 \nLeonard: Just ask another one.\nPenny: Okay. What artificial satellite has seen glimpses of Einsteins predicted frame dragging? (Raj buzzes.)\nSheldon: And of course it\u2019s Gravity Probe B.\nLeonard: Sheldon, you have to let somebody else answer. \nSheldon: Why? \nPenny: Because it\u2019s polite.\nSheldon: What do manners have to do with it? This is war. Were the Romans polite when they salted the ground of Carthage to make sure nothing would ever grow again?\nPenny: Leonard, you said I only had to ask questions. \nSheldon: The objective of the competition is to give correct answers, if I know them, why shouldn\u2019t I give them? \nHoward: Some of us might have the correct answers too. \nSheldon: Oh please, you don\u2019t even have a PhD. \nHoward: Alright, that\u2019s it.\nLeonard: Howard, sit down.\nHoward: Okay. \nLeonard: maybe we should take a little break.\nSheldon: Good idea, I need my wrist brace, all this button pushing is aggravating my old Nintendo injury. \nHoward (after Raj whispers in his ear): I agree.\nPenny: What did he say? \nHoward: He compared Sheldon to a disposable feminine cleansing product one might use on a summer\u2019s eve. \nPenny: Yeah, and the bag it came in. \nScene: The same, later. Sheldon is on his laptop. Leonard enters.\nSheldon: Leonard, excellent, I want to show you something.\nLeonard: Can it wait, I need to talk to you.\nSheldon: Just look. I\u2019ve designed the perfect uniforms for our team. The colours are based on Star Trek, the original series. The three of you will wear support red, and I will wear command gold. \nLeonard: Why do they say AA? \nSheldon: Army Ants. \nLeonard: Isn\u2019t that confusing? AA might mean something else to certain people. \nSheldon: Why would a physics bowl team be called anodised aluminium?\nLeonard: No, I meant\u2026. never mind. Hey, check it out. I got you a Batman cookie jar!\nSheldon: Oh neat, what\u2019s the occasion?\nLeonard: Well, you\u2019re a friend, and you like Batman, and cookies, and you\u2019re off the team. \nSheldon: What?\nLeonard: Howard, Raj and I just had a team meeting. \nSheldon: No you didn\u2019t.\nLeonard: Yes we did, I just came from it.\nSheldon: Okay, I don\u2019t know where you just came from, but it couldn\u2019t have been a team meeting because I\u2019m on the team and I wasn\u2019t there, ergo the team did not meet. \nLeonard: Okay, let me try it this way, uh, I was at a coffee klatch with a couple of friends and one thing led to another and it turns out you\u2019re off the team. \nSheldon: Why?\nLeonard: Because you\u2019re taking all the fun out of it.\nSheldon: Well, I\u2019m sorry, is the winner of the physics bowl the team that has the most fun?\nLeonard: Okay, let me try it this way, you\u2019re annoying and no-one wants to play with you any more. \nSheldon: I see. Well. At this point I should inform you that I intend to form my own team and destroy the molecular bonds that bind your very matter together, and reduce the resulting particulate chaos to tears.\nLeonard: Thanks for the heads up. \nSheldon: You\u2019re welcome. One more thing.\nLeonard: Yes.\nSheldon: It\u2019s on, bitch. \nScene: The cafeteria. \nHoward: So who\u2019d he get to be on his team.\nLeonard: He won\u2019t say. He just smiles, and eats macaroons out of his bat jar. \nRaj: He\u2019s using psychological warfare. We must reply in kind. I say we wait until he looks at us, then laugh like, yes, you are a smart and strong competitor, but we are also smart and strong and we have a reasonable chance of defeating you. \nLeonard: How exactly would that laugh go? \nRaj: Hee hee hee hee hee hee hee!\nHoward: That sounds more like, we are a tall thin woman who wants to make a coat out of your Dalmatians. \nLeonard: Guys, let\u2019s remember that Sheldon is still our friend and my room mate.\nHoward: So?\nLeonard: So nothing, let\u2019s destroy him. \nSheldon (walking past): Gentlemen.\nRaj: Hee hee hee hee hee hee hee!\nHoward: Okay, we\u2019re going to need a strong fourth for our team.\nRaj: You know who\u2019s apparently very smart, is the girl who played TV\u2019s Blossom. She got a PhD in neuroscience or something. \nLeonard: Raj, we\u2019re not getting TV\u2019s Blossom to join our physics bowl team. \nRaj: How about the girl from the Wonder Years? \nHoward: Gentlemen, I believe I\u2019ve found the solution to all our problems. \nLeonard: We can\u2019t ask Leslie Winkle.\nRaj: Why? Because you slept together and when she was done with you she discarded you like last night\u2019s chutney? \nLeonard: Yes. \nHoward: Sometimes you\u2019ve got to take one for the team.\nRaj: Yeah. Sack up, dude. \nLeonard: Fine. Here I go, taking one for the team. In the sack. Hey Leslie.\nLeslie: Hi guys.\nLeonard: Leslie, I have a question for you, and it might be a little awkward, you know, given that I\u2026\nHoward: Hit that thang. \nLeslie: Leonard, there\u2019s no reason to feel uncomfortable just because we\u2019ve seen each other\u2019s faces and naked bodies contorted in the sweet agony of coitus. \nLeonard: There\u2019s not? Gee, cos it sure sounds like there should be. \nLeslie: Rest assured that any aspects of our sexual relationship regarding your preferences, your idiosyncrasies, your performance, are still protected by the inherent confidentiality of the bedroom.\nLeonard: That\u2019s all very comforting, but if it\u2019s okay, I\u2019d like to get on with my question now.\nLeslie: Proceed.\nLeonard: We are entering the physics bowl and we need a fourth for our team.\nLeslie: No thanks, I\u2019m really busy with my like sign dilepton super symmetry search.\nHoward: Dilepton, schmilepton, we need you. \nLeslie: Sorry. \nHoward: Well, we tried. Just have to face Sheldon mano-e-mano-e-mano. A-mano. \nLeslie: Wait, you\u2019re going up against Sheldon Cooper? \nHoward: Yes.\nLeslie: That arrogant, misogynistic East-Texas doorknob that told me I should abandon my work with high energy particles for laundry and child bearing? \nLeonard: She\u2019s in. \nScene: The Physics Bowl.\nPenny: So, how do you feel? Nice and loose? Come to play? Got your game face on? (The guys look confused.) Are you ready?\nLeonard: Oh, yeah. You know you don\u2019t have to stay for the whole thing. \nPenny: Oh, no, no, I want to. It sounds really interesting. \nSheldon (entering in his Star Trek themed shirt): Gentlemen.\nLeonard: Sheldon.\nHoward: Sheldon. \nRaj: Hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee.\nPenny: Sheldon. I\u2019m just going to sit down. \nLeonard: So, is that your team.\nSheldon: Actually, I don\u2019t need a team, I could easily defeat you single-handedly. But the rules require four, so may I introduce, the third floor janitor, he lady from the lunchroom, and, my Spanish is not good, either her son or her butcher. And what about your team? What rat have you recruited to the SS Sinking Ship?\nLeslie: Hello, Sheldon. \nSheldon: Leslie Winkle? \nLeslie: Yeah, Leslie Winkle. The answer to the question, who made Sheldon Cooper cry like a little girl? \nSheldon: Yes, well, I\u2019m polymerised tree sap and you\u2019re non-organic adhesive so, whatever verbal projectile you launch in my direction is reflected off of me, returns on its original trajectory, and adheres to you. \nLeslie: Oh, ouch. \nDr Gablehouser: Okay, if everyone could please take your seats. \nLeonard: Here\u2019s your tee-shirt. (Hands her a tee-shirt with PMS on it. Takes jacket off to reveal similar.) \nLeslie: PMS? It\u2019s a couple of days early, but\u2026\nLeonard: No, it stands for Perpetual Motion Squad. \nLeslie: Oh, right, of course, what was I thinking? \nGablehouser: Good afternoon everyone, and welcome to this year\u2019s physics bowl. Today\u2019s preliminary match features two great teams\u2026 AA versus PMS. \nHoward: All night long, y\u2019all! (Stands and turns round to reveal the back of the tee-shirt which reads \u201cWe Can Go All Night\u201d.)\nGablehouser: Okay, well let\u2019s jump right in, first question, for ten points. What is the isospan singlet partner of the Pi Zero Meson? (Buzz) PMS?\nLeonard: The Eta Meson.\nGablehouser: Correct. \nSheldon: Formal protest.\nGablehouser: On what grounds?\nSheldon: The Velcro on my wrist brace caught on my shirt.\nGablehouser: Denied. Alright, for ten points, what is the lightest element on earth with no stable isotope. (Buzz) AA?\nSheldon: And of course, the answer is Technetium.\nGablehouser: Terrific. Next question, what is the force between two uncharged plates due to quantum vacuum fluctuation. (Buzz) PMS?\nRaj: Sheldon can suck on, the Casimir Effect.\nGablehouser: Correct. \n(Time shift) \nGablehouser: How does a quantum computer factor large numbers. (Buzz) PMS?\nLeslie: Shor\u2019s Algorithm.\nGablehouser: Correct. \n(Time shift)\nSheldon: 4.1855 times ten to the seventh ergs per calorie.\n\u00a0(Time shift)\nLeonard: Prevost\u2019s theory of exchanges. \n(Time shift)\nSheldon: Lamda equals one over Pi R squared N \n(Time shift)\nHoward: 760 degrees celsius, the approximate temperature of the young lady in the front row.\nGablehouser: Mr Wolowitz, this is your second warning. \n(Time shift)\nSheldon: A sigma particle.\n(Time shift)\nLeslie: Yes, assuming the hypothetical planet has a mass greater than the earth.\nGablehouser: Correct. Ladies and gentlemen, I hold in my hand the final question. The score now stands AA 1150, PMS 1175. So, for one hundred points, and the match, please turn your attention to the formula on the screens. Solve the equation. \nRaj: Holy crap. \nLeonard: What the hell is that.\nHoward: It looks like something they found on the ship at Roswell. \nLeonard: Come on, think, Leslie.\nLeslie: Leonard, it\u2019s not going to work if you rush me, you have to let me get there.\nLeonard: You\u2019re never going to let that go, are you? \nGablehouser: Ten seconds. (Buzz) PMS.\nLeonard: Sorry, I panicked. \nHoward: Then guess.\nLeonard: Um, eight. (Gablehouser stares at him.) Point four. \nGablehouser: I\u2019m sorry, that\u2019s incorrect. AA, if you can answer correctly, the match is yours. \nHoward: He doesn\u2019t have it. He\u2019s got squat.\n(Sheldon looks more and more uncomfortable, so much he is involuntarily twitching.)\nGablehouser: AA, I need your answer. (Buzz)\nThird Floor Janitor: The answer is minus eight by alpha. \nSheldon: Hang on, hang on a second, that\u2019s not our answer. What are you doing?\nThird Floor Janitor: Answering question. Winning physics bowl. \nSheldon: How do you know anything about physics?\nThird Floor Janitor: Here I am janitor, in former Soviet Union I am physicist. Leningrad Politechnica. Go Polar Bears. \nSheldon: Well that\u2019s a delightful little story, but our arrangement was that you sit here and not say anything, I answer the questions.\nThird Floor Janitor: You didn\u2019t answer question.\nSheldon: Hey look, now maybe you have democracy now in your beloved Russia, but on this physics bowl team I rule with an iron fist. (Makes fist in the air). Ow!\nGablehouser: AA, I need your official answer.\nSheldon: Well it\u2019s not what he said.\nGablehouser: Then what is it? \nSheldon: I want a different question.\nGablehouser: You can\u2019t have a different question. \nSheldon: Formal protest.\nGablehouser: Denied.\nSheldon: Informal protest.\nGablehouser: Denied. I need your official answer.\nSheldon: No. I decline to provide one.\nGablehouser: Well, that\u2019s too bad, because the answer your teammate gave was correct. \nSheldon: That\u2019s your opinion.\nGablehouser: Alright, the winner of the match is\u2026\nLeonard: Hang on. Sheldon, is proving that you are single-handedly smarter than everyone else so important that you would rather lose by yourself than win as part of a team. \nSheldon: I don\u2019t understand the question. \nLeonard: Go ahead.\nGablehouser: The winner is PMS! \n(We Are The Champions by Queen plays as the team celebrate in slow motion and Sheldon puts his head in his hands. The celebration ends with Howard on his knees ripping his shirt in half and waving it round his head before throwing it to the audience.)\nScene: The apartment. Sheldon goes to sit in his spot.\nLeonard: Sorry, somebody\u2019s sitting there.\nSheldon: Who?\nLeonard: My Physics Bowl Trophy! \nSheldon: That trophy is meaningless, I forfeited, therefore you did not win. \nLeonard: I know someone who would disagree.\nSheldon: Who?\nLeonard: My Physics Bowl Trophy! (In weird voice) \u201cLeonard is so smart, Sheldon who?\u201d\nSheldon: Alright that is very immature.\nLeonard: You\u2019re right, I\u2019m sorry. (In voice, waving trophy in Sheldon\u2019s face) I\u2019m not! \nPenny (entering): Okay, new contest. \nLeonard: What are you doing?\nPenny: I\u2019m settling once and for all who is the smartest around here. Okay, are you ready?\nSheldon: Absolutely.\nLeonard: Bring it on.\nPenny: Okay. Marsha, Jan and Cindy were the three daughters of what TV family? (They stare at her.) The Brady Bunch. Okay, Sammy Hagar replaced David Lee Roth as the lead singer in what group?\nSheldon (after they look at each other in confusion): The Brady Bunch? \nPenny: Van Halen. Alright, Madonna was married to this Ridgemont High alum. (Pause) Oh my God, Sean Penn!\nLeonard: How do you know these things?\nPenny: I go outside and I talk to people. Alright, here, what actor holds the record for being named people magazine\u2019s sexiest man alive?\nSheldon: William Shatner.\nLeonard: Wait, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s Shatner.\nSheldon: Then it\u2019s got to be Patrick Stewart. \nPenny: No.\nSheldon: Formal protest. \nPenny: Alright, singer who sang \u201cOops I Did It Again.\u201d (Sheldon starts involuntarily twitching again.) Okay, Tweetie Bird, taught he taw a what?\nSheldon (after they pass a smug look between each other): Romulan.\nPenny: Yes. He taught he taw a Romulan. \n(Sheldon and Leonard do a victory hand slide.)\u00a0\u00a0\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "6_19": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s apartment.\nBernadette: What you doing?\nHoward: You said clean up. I\u2019m cleaning up.\nBernadette: You can\u2019t just throw everything in the closet.\nHoward: Hey, you can tell me what to do or you can tell me how to do it, but you can\u2019t do both. This isn\u2019t sex.\nBernadette: What if someone looks in there?\nHoward: They\u2019re just coming over for dinner. No one\u2019s gonna look in the closet.\nBernadette: Well, you don\u2019t know that. What if someone\u2019s looking for the bathroom and they open that door?\nHoward: Could work out. For all we know there\u2019s a toilet in there somewhere.\nBernadette: Fine. But after tonight we need to get a handle on this mess.\nHoward: You know what we should do? We should show the closet to Sheldon.\nBernadette: Why?\nHoward: Are you kidding? He\u2019s like a savant at organizing. Everything in his apartment has a label on it. Including his label maker, which has a label that says label maker. And if you look really close at that label maker label, you\u2019ll see a label that says label.\nBernadette: He\u2019s our guest, we can\u2019t just ask him to straighten our closet.\nHoward: No, we wouldn\u2019t ask him. We\u2019d just show him the closet and let the goblins in his head take it from there.\nLater.\nHoward: Hey, guys, come on in.\nAll: Hi.\nPenny: Ooh, it smells good.\nBernadette: Thanks. And, Sheldon, I know tonight\u2019s the night you eat Thai food, so I went to the Asian market, got all the ingredients and made it from scratch.\nSheldon: Oh, you shouldn\u2019t have.\nBernadette: Oh, it\u2019s my pleasure.\nSheldon: No, you really shouldn\u2019t have. I brought my own.\nBernadette: You stopped and got him takeout?\nLeonard: I had no choice. He kept kicking the back of my seat.\nBernadette: Sheldon, I\u2019ve been cooking all day.\nSheldon: Well, now don\u2019t you feel silly.\nBernadette: Show him the closet.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s apartment.\nRaj: These spring rolls are amazing. Good job, Bernadette.\nBernadette: That\u2019s the takeout that Sheldon brought.\nRaj: Oh, well, I\u2019m sure they wouldn\u2019t have tasted nearly as good if I hadn\u2019t tried your food first.\nSheldon: Howard, did you want your clothes arranged seasonally or by colour?\nHoward: Colour\u2019s fine.\nSheldon: Wrong, they\u2019ll be arranged seasonally.\nPenny: Sheldon, aren\u2019t you gonna spend a little time with Amy?\nAmy: Oh, it\u2019s okay, I\u2019m used to it. The other day at Whole Foods, he spent an hour optimizing the cheese aisle.\nSheldon: Yeah, and some thanks I got. The assistant manager chased me out with an artisanal salami.\nAmy: His quirks just make you love him more. Someone please agree with me.\nScene: The closet.\nLeonard: Sheldon, come on. It\u2019s getting late. Time to go.\nSheldon: Oh, five more minutes.\nLeonard: That\u2019s what you said five minutes ago. Amy and Penny are already in the car. Let\u2019s move it.\nSheldon: How come I never get to do anything I want to do?\nHoward: You know, if he really wants to stay and finish, I can give him a ride home.\nSheldon: Please, Leonard, he said it\u2019s okay.\nLeonard: Sheldon, it\u2019s, wait, I can go home without you? Bye.\nSheldon: Howard, I have a few questions. I found three bowling pins. Now, do you juggle these, or are you missing seven?\nHoward: Juggle.\nSheldon: You health nuts kill me.\nBernadette: Oh, my God, it\u2019s beautiful. Look, he found the juggling pins I hid.\nSheldon: Uh, just a couple more items. Howard, I found this letter from your dad in a box. Now, based on the content, it could either be filed\u2026\nHoward: Whoa, you opened this?\nSheldon: Well, I had to find out if it was personal correspondence or memorabilia. Now, as I was saying, based on the content\u2026\nHoward: I couldn\u2019t be less interested. Now, come on, I\u2019ll take you home.\nBernadette: Howard, don\u2019t you want to know what\u2019s in the letter?\nHoward: If I wanted to know, I would\u2019ve opened it years ago. The closet looks great. Let\u2019s get out of here.\nSheldon: Wait, can I bring this box of extra shirt buttons to sort on the ride?\nHoward: Do whatever you want.\nSheldon: Thanks. Oh. Great party.\nScene: The stairwell.\nLeonard: You know, when I first met Howard, he would pull his scrotum out of his shorts and say, aw, I sat in gum.\nPenny: What is your point?\nLeonard: Well, it\u2019s just kind of weird how grown up he is now. Happily married guy throwing dinner parties.\nPenny: Really? You couldn\u2019t just say that? You had to tell the scrotum story?\nLeonard: Trying to paint a picture.\nPenny: It was a nice change of pace not eating takeout around a coffee table.\nLeonard: Mm, you know, we could throw a dinner party, too. Maybe even ask everyone to get dressed up.\nPenny: Sure. Just, when you say dressed up, you mean nice clothes, right? Not, like, capes and tights and crap?\nLeonard: Yeah. Although\u2026\nPenny: No.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s apartment.\nBernadette: Howie, you okay?\nHoward: Yeah, I just couldn\u2019t sleep.\nBernadette: Told you you shouldn\u2019t have espresso after dinner. I know the little cups make you feel big, but it\u2019s not worth it.\nHoward: It\u2019s this stupid letter.\nBernadette: Did you read it?\nHoward: No.\nBernadette: You must be curious.\nHoward: Of course I\u2019m curious. I haven\u2019t seen the man since, oh, I was a little kid. And a letter shows up on my 18th birthday? What\u2019s that about?\nBernadette: Why don\u2019t you read it? Maybe he apologizes or explains why he left.\nHoward: He abandoned me and my mother. Why does he deserve a chance to explain anything?\nBernadette: I get that. So, what do you want to do with it?\nHoward: Something I should have done a long time ago. (Sets fire to it)\nBernadette: Really? Are you sure?\nHoward: Yep.\nBernadette: Feel better?\nHoward: I do. (Smoke alarm goes off) Great. Neither one of us is tall enough to reach that.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment.\nAmy: I can\u2019t believe he set it on fire.\nBernadette: Yeah, just seeing that letter really freaked him out. And he was already having a tough day \u2019cause he accidentally wore my pants to work. I don\u2019t know why he was upset. They were bigger on him than me.\nAmy: Boy, I\u2019m really curious what was in that letter.\nBernadette: Me, too, but I guess now we\u2019ll never know.\nAmy: Well, you said Sheldon read it. Why not ask him?\nBernadette: I can\u2019t do that. What kind of wife would I be if I didn\u2019t respect my husband\u2019s privacy?\nPenny: What if I ask Sheldon, you just happen to be in the room?\nBermadette: That works.\nPenny: Okay.\nScene: The laundry room.\nSheldon: Bleuch. Like cleaning out the entire building\u2019s belly button.\nPenny: Hey, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Oh, hello. What can I do for you ladies?\nAmy: You have something we want.\nSheldon: Oh, dear. My mother warned me this is what happens to pretty boys in the big city.\nPenny: No, we just want information.\nSheldon: Oh. Oh, I\u2019ve got that in spades. Ravage me.\nPenny: We heard you read the letter from Howard\u2019s father.\nSheldon: I did.\nPenny: What did it say?\nSheldon: I can\u2019t tell you that. I\u2019m bound by closet organizer/organizee confidentiality.\nAmy: Sheldon, that\u2019s not a real thing.\nSheldon: Well, neither is the rule that you have to hold your girlfriend\u2019s hand at the movies. You know. That doesn\u2019t stop you from pawing at me like you\u2019re a bear and I\u2019m a trash can full of sweets.\nPenny: Why do you even care? Just tell us what it says.\nSheldon: Control over the information contained in that letter belongs to Howard. By happenstance, I came to know it. That doesn\u2019t give me the right to disseminate it freely.\nPenny: Come on. Look, the letter was found in Bernadette\u2019s closet. Doesn\u2019t that count for something?\nSheldon: Are you pointing out that California is a community property state, and since Howard and Bernadette are married, the intellectual property contained in that letter is jointly owned by the two spouses?\nPenny: Yeah, obviously.\nSheldon: Well played. Sometimes I don\u2019t give you enough credit, Penny.\nScene: The apartment.\nRaj: Dude, you made the right choice coming to me for help with this party.\nLeonard: Actually, all I did was invite you.\nRaj: Well, put your mind at ease. I\u2019m here to make sure your dinner party kicks Howard\u2019s dinner party\u2019s ass. Now, the first thing we need is a theme. I\u2019m thinking, ah, turn-of-the-century Moulin Rouge.\nLeonard: I\u2019m thinking you need a testosterone patch. Penny and I just want to do something low-key. You know, cocktails, light jazz music, hors d\u2019oeuvres.\nRaj: So your theme is I saw a rerun of Mad Men and bought some crab puffs from Trader Joe\u2019s? Hate to miss that.\nLeonard: Hey, where have you been?\nSheldon: Oh, Leonard. If I was prone to sarcasm, I\u2019d say I was pulling off a major heist at the museum of laundry baskets.\nLeonard: One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. I meant, golly, Sheldon, you\u2019ve been gone a long time.\nSheldon: Oh. Yeah, well, I was waylaid by Penny, Bernadette and Amy. They made me reveal confidential information about Howard\u2019s father.\nLeonard: What information?\nSheldon: I can\u2019t tell you that. I am bound by closet organizer/organizee confidentiality.\nRaj: Well, come on, we won\u2019t tell anyone.\nSheldon: Sorry, badgering me won\u2019t work. What you should have said is, It\u2019s pointless to keep this a secret because Penny will tell us.\nLeonard: Fine, then that.\nSheldon: All right, I\u2019ll tell you. My goodness, everyone\u2019s on their game today.\nScene: The apartment kitchen.\nAmy: This is really fun.\nRaj: Yeah, it\u2019s nice to get dressed up once in a while.\nPenny: Yeah, and the hors d\u2019oeuvres are delightful.\nLeonard: As is the company.\nPenny: Aw.\nSheldon: My shirt is itchy and I wish I were dead.\nLeonard: Hey, uh, listen, everybody. Before Howard gets here, et\u2019s all just agree to not bring up the letter from his father.\nRaj: Of course.\nPenny: Sure.\nAmy: Absolutely.\nSheldon: If I say yes, can we turn off that Latin orgy music?\nScene: The stairwell.\nHoward: Ridiculous that we still have to walk up all these flights of stairs.\nBernadette: Yeah, try doing it in heels.\nHoward: I am.\nBernadette: Wait. There\u2019s something I have to tell you.\nHoward: What?\nBernadette: I know what was in your dad\u2019s letter.\nHoward: Sheldon, I swear to God, I\u2019m gonna kill you.\nAmy: Hey.\nBernadette: I made him tell us.\nHoward: What? Us? Who else knows?\nPenny: I know.\nAmy: Me, too.\nLeonard: Same here.\nRaj: Shame on all of you.\nLeonard: You know, too.\nRaj: Couldn\u2019t leave him one friend, could you?\nHoward: So everybody knows what\u2019s in that letter except for me?\nSheldon: Yes, it\u2019s six against one. Stand down, sir.\nHoward: How could you do this?\nBernadette: I\u2019m sorry.\nRaj: If you want, we could tell you.\nHoward: No, I don\u2019t want to know. I mean, I do, but\u2026 I got to go.\nAmy: Use me as a human shield!\nSheldon: I panicked. He looked taller than usual.\nScene: The closet.\nBernadette (off): Howard?\nHoward: In here.\nBernadette: I\u2019m sorry. I should have left it alone.\nHoward: It\u2019s okay. Sorry I ran off like that.\nBernadette: What are you looking at?\nHoward: Uh, pictures of my dad and me when I was a kid.\nBernadette: That\u2019s nice.\nHoward: I got to tell you, as angry as I am at Sheldon for blabbing, he did a hell of a job organizing this closet. Look at this. Photos of Wolowitz family before father left forever. Check out nine-year-old Howie with cornrows. Neither race was happy to see me with those.\nBernadette: Think you could take a break?\nHoward: Why?\nBernadette: Got a little surprise for you. Come on.\nHoward: Oh, honey, I am in no mood to have sex tonight. I\u2019ll lay there if you absolutely have to have it, but\u2026 Oh. What are you guys doing here?\nLeonard: When you left, you weren\u2019t sure whether or not you wanted to know what was in your dad\u2019s letter, so we came up with kind of a cool solution.\nHoward: Oh, yeah, what\u2019s that?\nSheldon: It\u2019s simple, really. It occurred to me that knowing and not knowing can be achieved by creating a macroscopic example of quantum superposition. The, the principle that a physical system exists partially in all its possible states at once.\nPenny: We were all thinking it, really. It was kind of the elephant in the room, so\u2026\nSheldon: Anyway, um, I realized that if we each present you with an account of what your father wrote to you, only one of which is true, and then we don\u2019t tell you which one it is, you will forever be in a state of epistemic ambivalence.\nPenny: Yeah. And I said if it wasn\u2019t epistemic, we might as well not do it.\nBernadette: Sit down, honey.\nLeonard: Raj, you\u2019re up.\nRaj: Okay, um, It was a card for your 18th birthday. Inside it said, Happy birthday, Howard. I love you. Dad. Oh, and it was a Far Side card, the one where the frog has its tongue stuck to the underside of an airplane. Thinks it\u2019s a fly. Silly frog. So funny.\nLeonard: Sheldon.\nSheldon: It was a map leading to the lost treasure of famous pirate One-Eyed Willy.\nHoward: Nice try. That\u2019s the plot for Goonies.\nAmy: Told you.\nSheldon: Don\u2019t.\nLeonard: Amy.\nAmy: You didn\u2019t know it, but your father was in the auditorium at your high school graduation. And he cried because he was so proud of you.\nHoward: Really?\nSheldon: Or that\u2019s complete poppycock which Amy made up. It still could be the map.\nLeonard: Penny.\nPenny: It was a letter explaining that your dad wasn\u2019t who he said he was. Eventually, his other life caught up to him, and the only way to keep you and your mom safe was to leave.\nSheldon: I would like to change mine. The pirate\u2019s name was Peg-Leg Antoine. Now it\u2019s completely different from Goonies.\nAmy: No, it\u2019s not.\nSheldon: Don\u2019t.\nLeonard: Okay, my turn. Your dad wrote about how family is the most important thing, and that you should never throw it away like he did.\nHoward: Hmm.\nLeonard: Bernadette.\nBernadette: Inside the envelope was a picture of your dad holding you the day you were born. On the back he wrote Howard, my son, my greatest gift. You okay?\nHoward: Yeah. I\u2019m terrific.\nLeonard: So, which one do you think it is, matey?\nHoward: Actually, I don\u2019t want to know. I want all of them to be true.\nLeonard: Well, one of them is.\nHoward: That\u2019s pretty cool. Thank you, guys.\nPenny: Hey, it\u2019s still early. Why don\u2019t we go back and have that party?\nRaj: Yeah,\nLeonard: Yeah, cool.\nAmy: Okay.\nSheldon: You know, surprisingly, uh, the letter from your father wasn\u2019t the most interesting thing I read in the closet. Bernadette\u2019s diary has some saucy passages.\nBernadette: Sheldon, don\u2019t you dare.\nSheldon: There\u2019s nothing to worry about. Your secret\u2019s safe with me.\nBernadette: That\u2019s more like it.\nSheldon: Although copyright law would allow me to quote snippets in the context of a review.\nScene: The apartment.\nBernadette: Glad you\u2019re feeling better.\nHoward: Me, too. If I\u2019d known we were gonna be dancing, would have worn my flats.\nPenny: This turned out pretty well, huh?\nLeonard: Yeah, I think so.\nRaj: I agree. That is, if you\u2019ve never been to or heard of a party before.\nAmy: If you\u2019d let me pierce your brain with a hot needle in the right place, you\u2019d be happy all the time.\nSheldon: Uh, Penny, I, I have a couple of questions about your closet. Is there any reason you\u2019re keeping this dead goldfish?\nPenny: Damn, I forgot to feed him. And that I had him.\nSheldon: Well, now, did you also have a dog? Because I found what appears to be a battery-operated chew toy.\nPenny: Party\u2019s over! Party\u2019s over!\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "2_17": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The Apartment\n\nHoward: Okay, Raj, hand me the number six torque screwdriver.\nSheldon: Stop. We can\u2019t do this, it\u2019s not right.\nRaj: Sheldon, you have two choices. Either you let him put a bigger hard drive in the TiVo, or you delete stuff before we go out of town.\nSheldon: But once you open the box, you\u2019ve voided the warranty. The warranty is a sacred covenant we\u2019ve entered into with the manufacturer. He offers to stand by his equipment, and we in return agree not to violate the integrity of the internal hardware. This little orange sticker is all that stands between us and anarchy.\nLeonard: Okay, then we won\u2019t touch the hard drive. We\u2019ll just erase the first season of Battlestar.\nSheldon (ripping off sticker): There. We\u2019re outlaws.\nPenny (entering with a pink suitcase): Here you go, Leonard. Is this going to be big enough?\nLeonard: It\u2019s perfect.\nHoward: For taking daffodils to your unicorn.\nLeonard: It\u2019s just for my notebooks. Thanks, Penny.\nPenny: Oh, I love San Francisco. I wish I was going with you.\nSheldon: I understand your envy. This is a can\u2019t-miss symposium. There are going to be discussions on bioorganic cellular computer devices, the advancements in multi-threaded task completion, plus a roundtable on the nonequilibrium Green\u2019s function approach to the photoionization process in atoms.\nPenny: When I go, I usually just get hammered and ride the cable cars.\nLeonard: This conference is kind of a big thing. The keynote address is being delivered by George Smoot.\nPenny: Oh, my God, the George Smoot?\nLeonard: You\u2019ve heard of him?\nPenny: Of course I haven\u2019t.\nSheldon: George Smoot is a Nobel Prize-winning physicist, one of the great minds of our time. His work in black body form and anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background radiation cemented our understanding of the origin of the universe.\nPenny: It\u2019s kind of a funny name, though, Smoot.\nSheldon: It\u2019s like talking to a chimp.\nPenny: Okay, now that I\u2019ve been completely insulted, have a good flight.\nLeonard: Yeah, I wish.\nSheldon: We\u2019re not flying, we\u2019re taking the train.\nPenny: Oh, cool.\nHoward: Yeah, cool. Seven times as long as flying, and costs almost twice as much.\nPenny: Well, then why are you doing it?\nLeonard: Well, we had a vote. Three of us voted for airplane, Sheldon voted for train, so we\u2019re taking the train.\nSheldon: Don\u2019t say it like that, Leonard, say it like: we\u2019re taking the train!\nCredits sequence.\n\u00a0\nScene: Sheldon\u2019s bedroom.\nLeonard: Hey, we\u2019re all going over to the Apple store to make fun of the guys at the Genius Bar. You want to come?\nSheldon: Oh, I always enjoy that, but I\u2019m a little busy.\nLeonard: What are you doing?\nSheldon: I\u2019m simplifying the task of packing for our trip. See, by attaching RFID tags to my clothing, it will enable my laptop to read and identify the items with this wand. I will then cross-reference them against destination, anticipated activity spectrum, weather conditions, duration of trip, et cetera.\nLeonard: Well, that does sound much simpler. How long is this going to take?\nSheldon: Assuming I can keep up this pace, three hours, 11 minutes, and plus however long it takes to conclude this fairly pointless conversation.\nLeonard: Wow. Teasing the guys at the Apple store seems a little redundant now.\nSheldon: I don\u2019t follow.\nLeonard: I wouldn\u2019t expect you to. I\u2019ll see you later.\nSheldon: Socks, one pair, cotton, argyle, blue. Socks, one pair, cotton, argyle, blue.\nScene: On the train.\nSheldon: What on earth are you doing?\nRaj: Whatever it is, I\u2019m guessing we\u2019re doing it wrong.\nSheldon: Gentlemen, this is the Coast Starlight, one of the great American trains operating on one of the classic American routes. On this side, you\u2019ll see panoramic ocean vistas inaccessible to any other form of transportation, while on your side, you\u2019ll be treated to 350 miles of CostCos, Jiffy Lubes, and cinderblock homes with above-ground pools.\nHoward: Come on, Raj.\nRaj: What\u2019s wrong with Jiffy Lubes?\nSheldon: No.\nLeonard: Why not?\nSheldon: That\u2019s over the wheelbase. Are you completely unfamiliar with the suspension characteristics of a pre-1980 Pullman-built Superliner Deluxe passenger coach?\nLeonard: Sheldon, we\u2019ve been on this train 90 seconds, and you\u2019ve already said a thousand words. Just tell us where to sit and shut up.\nSheldon: Here. I\u2019m hoping once you reap the endorphic rewards of the steady clickety-clack of steel wheels on polished rails, your sour disposition will abate.\nLeonard: Yeah, maybe. Meanwhile back in the 21st century, people are raising their tray tables and putting their seat-backs in an upright position \u2019cause it\u2019s time to land in San Francisco.\nRaj: It\u2019s not so bad, really. At least these trains have modern plumbing. In India, you squat over a hole in the train and expose your naked buttocks to the chilly air of Rajasthan.\nSheldon: He is referring, of course, to third class on Indian Railways\u2019 magnificent Ranakpur Express and its twelve hundred kilometer journey from Maharashtra to the Bikaner Junction.\nLeonard: Oh, look, now he\u2019s boring on an international scale.\nRaj: Holy crap! Look!\nLeonard: Is that who I think it is?\nHoward: It can\u2019t be. What would Summer Glau be doing riding the train?\nLeonard: Maybe John Connor\u2019s aboard and she\u2019s protecting him from an evil Terminator.\nSheldon: Unlikely. That\u2019s a television show, Leonard.\nLeonard: Thank you.\nSheldon: Of course, if SkyNet actually did exist in the future, a perfect way to infiltrate and destroy mankind would be to send Terminators back posing as actors who have played Terminators in popular films and television series, lulling us into a false sense of security, i.e., that\u2019s Summer Glau from The Sarah Connor Chronicles. No, Summer, don\u2019t kill me! I\u2019m pro-robot! Ahh!\nLeonard: At least he\u2019s off the train crap.\nSheldon: Whee!\nHoward: Sheldon, I owe you an apology. Taking the train was a stroke of brilliance! I\u2019ve actually got a shot at a Terminator.\nRaj: Oh, please.When it comes to Terminators, you\u2019ve got a better shot of scoring with Arnold Schwarzenegger.\nHoward: You\u2019re overlooking something. I have 11 hours with her in a confined space. Unless she\u2019s willing to jump off a moving train, tuck and roll down the side of a hill, she will eventually succumb to the acquired taste that is Howard Wolowitz.\nLeonard: My money\u2019s on tuck and roll.\nSheldon: I\u2019m confused. I thought you were involved in some sort of socially intimate pairing with Leslie Winkle.\nHoward: Sheldon, let me explain to you how this works.\nSheldon: All right.\nHoward: That\u2019s Summer Glau.\nSheldon: Yes.\nHoward: That\u2019s it.\nRaj: Hang on a sec. Why do you get first crack at her?\nHoward: Um, well, let\u2019s see, couple reasons. One, I saw her first.\nRaj: No, you didn\u2019t. I did.\nHoward: Fair enough. But then let me move on to number two, unlike you, I can actually talk to women when I\u2019m sober.\nRaj: You fail to take into account that even mute, I am foreign and exotic, while you, on the other hand, are frail and pasty.\nHoward: Well, you know the old saying, pasty and frail never fail.\nLeonard: Excuse me, but what about me? Why don\u2019t I get a shot?\nHoward: Fine, go ahead. Take a shot.\nLeonard: You know, I\u2019ve already got a gorgeous blonde back home at I can\u2019t score with. I think I\u2019ll let you two take this one.\nRaj: Sheldon, is there a place on this train to get alcohol?\nSheldon: Interesting that you ask. The Coast Starlight recently added the refurbished Pacific Parlour Car. Built in 1956 and originally known as the Santa Fe Lounge Car, the lower level is a theatre\u2026\nRaj: Yeah-yeah, which way?\nSheldon: and the upper level is a bar that offers wine tastings if you\u2019re going as far as Portland.\nLeonard: So aren\u2019t you going to go talk to her?\nHoward: I will, I\u2019m just working on my opening line.\nLeonard: She\u2019s probably heard every possible line, Howard. Why don\u2019t you just try hello?\nHoward: No, no, no, that always creeps girls out. I need to come up with something that\u2019s funny, smart and delicately suggests that my sexual endowment is disproportionate to my physical stature.\nLeonard: You\u2019re going to need more than 11 hours.\nSheldon: Oh, no.\nLeonard: What\u2019s the matter?\nSheldon: I forgot my flash drive.\nLeonard: So?\nSheldon: So we have to go back.\nLeonard: Okay, Sheldon, I\u2019m going to say why and your answer cannot be because I forgot my flash drive.\nSheldon: You don\u2019t understand. My flash drive has my paper on astrophysical probes of M-theory effects in the early universe that I was going to give to George Smoot at the conference.\nLeonard: Why do you have to give your paper to George Smoot?\nSheldon: It\u2019s brilliant. He needs to read it.\nLeonard: So you\u2019ll send him an e-mail when we get back.\nSheldon: Then I won\u2019t get to see his face light up as he reads it.\nLeonard: Right. Of course.\nSheldon: Oh, this is an unmitigated disaster.\nLeonard: Well, there\u2019s nothing you can do about it, so relax, sit back, enjoy the clickety-clack of the steel wheels on the polished rails.\nSheldon: You forgot your flash drive, You forgot your flash drive (repeated over and over in time to the sound of the train)\nLeonard: Only ten hours, 55 minutes to go.\nTime Shift. \n\u00a0\nHoward (steeling himself to talk to Summer Glau, to himself): It\u2019s hot in here. Must be Summer. (Walks towards her, then walks straight past. Returns, makes to talk to her, then turns to two nuns over the other side of the corridor) So, where you gals headed?\nSheldon: Okay, I\u2019ve found the perfect solution. We get off the train at the next stop in Oxnard. We then take the 1:13 train back to Union Station. We take a cab back to the apartment, get my flash drive, and then race to San Luis Obispo, where, assuming the lights are with us and minimal traffic, we\u2019ll meet the train.\nLeonard: I\u2019ve got a better idea.\nSheldon: Are you going to be sarcastic?\nLeonard: Boy, you take all the fun out of it for me.\u00a0 But look, Penny\u2019s home. Why don\u2019t we just call her, have her go in the apartment, get your flash drive and e-mail you the paper?\nSheldon: But the flash drive is in a locked drawer in my desk.\nLeonard: So?\nSheldon: The key is hidden in my room.\nLeonard: So?\nSheldon: Penny would have to go into my room.\nLeonard: So?\nSheldon: People don\u2019t go in my room!\nLeonard: I see. Well, it seems once again, you\u2019re caught between a rock and a crazy place.\nSheldon: Oh, I hate when that happens.\nHoward (to self): It\u2019s hot in here. It must be Summer. It\u2019s hot in here. Must be Summer. It\u2019s hot in here. Must be Summer.\nRaj (walking past and straight up to Summer Glau): It\u2019s hot in here. Must be Summer.\nSummer: That\u2019s cute.\nRaj: Really? I just made it up. Have you seen Slumdog Millionaire?\nSummer: Oh, yeah, I loved it.\nRaj: It\u2019s loosely based on my life.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment. Penny is on the phone.\nPenny: Yeah, we\u2019re putting the play on for one night in this little 99-seat theatre. Can you come? Oh, great. Do you know 98 other people that might want to come? Oh, hang on. (Switches to another line) Hello?\nSheldon (on phone): Listen carefully. I\u2019m about to give you a set of instructions, which you must follow to the letter.\nPenny: Just a sec. (Switches back to first line) The theatre is above a bowling alley, so it\u2019s a little noisy, but it might be the only chance I\u2019ll ever get to play Anne Frank. And the director is brilliant. He uses the bowling sounds as, like, Nazi artillery. Okay, great, I\u2019ll see you then. (Switches line again) Hello?\nSheldon: Okay, step four. Do you see that small plastic case on my dresser?\nPenny: Your dresser? Who is this?\nSheldon: It\u2019s Sheldon.\nPenny: Oh, hey, Sheldon! How is San Francisco?\nSheldon: I\u2019m not in San Francisco. I\u2019m on a train. Were you even listening to me?\nPenny: Uh, no, I was talking to my friend, but what\u2019s up?\nSheldon: What\u2019s up? I\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s up. I\u2019m in a crisis situation, and I need you to marshal your powers of concentration, limited as they may be\u2026\nLeonard: Give me the phone. Hi, Penny. It\u2019s Leonard.\nPenny: Hey, Leonard. What\u2019s going on with Dr. Wackadoodle?\nLeonard: He\u2019s calling to ask you a favour. You might be confused because he didn\u2019t use the words, Penny, Sheldon, please or favour.\nSheldon: Okay. Enough chitchat. Okay, step one, locate your emergency key to our apartment. Step two, enter our apartment. Step three, enter my bedroom.\nPenny: Oh, hang on, Sheldon, getting another call.\nSheldon: No! Leonard, let me tell you something. Personal robots cannot get here soon enough.\nRaj: And that bright little star peeking her head out early today, that\u2019s Venus.\nSummer: That is so cool. You really know a lot about space.\nRaj: Come on. When you were on TV in Firefly, you were actually in space.\nSummer: You\u2019re not one of those guys who really believe that, are you?\nRaj: You mean one of the hopeless geeks? No. Those are crazy people. Howard, be a dear and get me another one of these. Now, him, he\u2019s one of those geeks.\nSheldon: All right, now, before you enter my bedroom unescorted, I need you to understand that this onetime grant of access does not create a permanent easement. Easement. It\u2019s a legal right\nof access. Good grief. What? No, don\u2019t put me on hold. Oh!\nHoward: Do you believe him? Normally around women, he has the personality of a boiled potato. Put one beer in him, and he\u2019s M. Night Charmalarmalon.\nLeonard: Is that what he\u2019s drinking? It\u2019s not even real beer.\nHoward: What?\nLeonard: Look at it. Non-alcoholic beer.\nHoward: What\u2019s going on?\nLeonard: I don\u2019t know. Some sort of placebo effect, I guess.\nHoward: Placebo, you say. Interesting.\nSheldon: Yes, I\u2019m still here. Where am I going? I\u2019m on a train. Now, what you\u2019ll be looking for is a small wooden box located between a Hoberman\u2019s sphere and a sample of quartz flecked with pyrite. Hoberman\u2019s Sphere. It\u2019s a collapsible icosidodecahedron. No, the thing with the time on it is my alarm clock.\nRaj: Actually, in India, the names of constellations are different. Where you have the Big Dipper, we have the Big Curry Pot.\nSummer: You\u2019re making that up.\nRaj: You got me. Now what are you going to do with me?\nHoward: Raj.\nRaj: Yes?\nHoward: Look.\nRaj: What am I looking at?\nHoward: You tell me.\nRaj: Non-alcoholic bee-ee-eeuh (Runs off)\nHoward: Hi, I\u2019m the small package good things come in.\nPenny: Okay, I got a box, but there\u2019s no key in here. Just letters.\nSheldon: That\u2019s the wrong box. Put it back.\nPenny: Oh, Sheldon, are these letters from your grandmother?\nSheldon: Don\u2019t read those letters!\nPenny: Oh, look, she calls you Moon Pie. That is so cute.\nSheldon: Put down the letters!\nLeonard: Hey, Penny. It\u2019s Leonard.\nPenny: Hey, Leonard. How\u2019s the train ride?\nLeonard: Delightful. Listen, I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing right now, but there are little bubbles forming on the corners of Sheldon\u2019s mouth.\nPenny: Okay, yeah, I kind of crossed a line. Put him back on.\nLeonard: Thank you.\nSheldon: I\u2019m back.\nPenny: What up, Moon Pie?\nSheldon: Nobody calls me Moon Pie but Meemaw!\nLeonard: Hey, Penny. Leonard again.\nHoward: So anyway, in the dream, you and I were ice skating, just the two of us. And then, I picked you up by your ankles and twirled you round and round until your legs tore off. I tried to stick them back on, but before I could, you turned into a giant loaf of pumpernickel bread. What do you think that means?\nSummer (uncomfortable): I really don\u2019t know.\nHoward: I\u2019ll give you a little clue. My favourite sandwich? Salami on pumpernickel.\nSummer: Is that so?\nHoward: And did you know the word \u201cpumpernickel\u201d comes from the German words pumper and nickel, which loosely translates to fart goblin?\nSummer: No. I didn\u2019t.\nPenny: Okay, I found the box. Now what?\nSheldon: You\u2019re holding a Japanese puzzle box, which takes ten precise moves to open. First, locate the panel with the diamond pattern and slide the centre portion one millimetre to the left. Then, on the opposite end of the box, slide the entire panel down two millimetres. You\u2019ll hear a slight click.\nPenny: Hang on. Sheldon, do you have any emotional attachment to this box?\nSheldon: No, it\u2019s a novelty I ordered off the Internet. Now, did you hear the click?\nPenny: Not yet. (Puts box on ground and stomps on it)There it is.\nHoward: Okay, here\u2019s another one. If you married the famous rock guitarist Johnny Winter, you\u2019d be Summer Winter.\nSummer: Uh-huh.\nHoward: Okay, I\u2019m going to just go for broke here and say I like you.\nSummer: Yeah?\nHoward: So here\u2019s my question, do you realistically see any conversational path that would take me from where we are right now to a place where I could ask you out and you\u2019d say yes?\nSummer: No.\nHoward: Fair enough. I\u2019ll leave you in peace.\nSummer: Thank you.\nHoward: But before I go, would you mind if I just take one picture of us together for my Facebook page?\nSummer: Sure.\nHoward: Okay. Great. Now, can I take one where it looks like we\u2019re making out?\nSheldon: Okay, now you\u2019re going to insert the flash drive into the USB port. She calls me Moon Pie because I\u2019m nummy-nummy and she could just eat me up, now, please put the flash drive in the USB port. The one that looks like a little duck\u2019s mouth.\nLeonard: Hey, how\u2019d it go?\nHoward: Terminator broke my phone.\nLeonard: Excuse me. (Goes down to Summer) Okay, I\u2019ll be honest with you. I\u2019ve just spent the last two hours imagining various scenarios in my head, trying to come up with some clever line to say to you. But then I finally realized you\u2019re a human being; I\u2019m a human being. I could just say to you\u2026\nAnnouncer: Next stop: Santa Barbara.\nSummer: I\u2019m sorry. This is me.\nLeonard: Hi, my name\u2019s Leonard.\nScene: The conference.\nSheldon: So, I\u2019m thinking, you won the Nobel Prize what, three years ago? So you must deal with a whole lot of what has Smoot done lately? My thought is we continue my research as a team, you know, Cooper-Smoot, alphabetical, and when we win the Nobel Prize, you\u2019ll be back on top.\nGeorge Smoot: With all due respect, Dr. Cooper, are you on crack?\nSheldon: Fine! Smoot-Cooper. Wow, what a diva.\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "9_3": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Would you pass the mustard?\nLeonard: Sure. Hey, want to hear a fun fact about mustard?\nSheldon: Is it that the glucosinolates which give mustard its flavour were evolved by the cabbage family as a chemical defence against caterpillars?\nLeonard: Yeah.\nSheldon: Well, that was fun. Good for you, Leonard.\nRaj (entering with Howard): Hey, there.\nLeonard: Hey, you\u2019re early. The movie doesn\u2019t start for an hour.\nHoward: Actually, we\u2019re not going to the movies. We are here to kidnap you.\nLeonard: What are you talking about?\nRaj: Well, you eloped and we didn\u2019t get a chance to throw you a bachelor party, so there\u2019s a van downstairs and we\u2019re here to take you to a surprise location for the weekend.\nSheldon: Well, I\u2019d hardly call this kidnapping. Where\u2019s the blindfold? Where\u2019s the duct tape? Where\u2019s the part where you call me and demand ransom and I try to keep you on the phone, but you hang up seconds before I can trace it and then I say I\u2019m getting too old for this crud?\nLeonard: When do we leave?\nHoward: Right now.\nRaj: Yeah, Penny packed you a bag.\nHoward: Wow, okay.\nSheldon: You\u2019re seriously going to get in a van and let these two take you to an unknown destination for an entire weekend?\nRaj: Oh, not just him, you\u2019re coming, too.\nSheldon: Oh, and how do you think you\u2019re going to get me to do that?\nScene: Outside, by a van.\nSheldon: Unhand me. This is ridiculous.\nHoward: I told you to put tape on his mouth.\nRaj: And I told you he bit me.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The van.\nSheldon: It\u2019s bad enough I\u2019m being taken against my will. I don\u2019t see why it has to be in some hippie\u2019s mobile sex dungeon.\nHoward: Well, Sheldon, there\u2019s something about this van that you\u2019re going to find very interesting.\nSheldon: It runs on syphilis?\nRaj: This van was owned and driven by your personal physics hero, Richard Feynman.\nSheldon: No.\nHoward: Yeah. A buddy of mine let me borrow it.\nLeonard: This was Feynman\u2019s van? That\u2019s so cool.\nRaj: Yeah, nothing\u2019s been changed since he drove it.\nHoward: I bet he picked up a lot of cute grad students in this bad boy.\nSheldon: Yeah, and talked about physics with them.\nLeonard: So, are you gonna give us a clue where we\u2019re headed?\nRaj: Uh, okay, let\u2019s see. They\u2019ve got spicy food and there\u2019s a chance you\u2019ll get diarrhoea.\nLeonard: India.\nRaj: We can drive there.\nLeonard: Your house?\nHoward: We are going to Me-hi-co.\nLeonard: Fun, I\u2019ve never been there.\nSheldon: Leonard, don\u2019t be fooled. I\u2019m from Texas, Me-hi-co is Spanish for Mexico.\nRaj: What\u2019s wrong with Mexico?\nSheldon: Uh, mariachi bands, wild dogs, beans that jump around \u2019cause there\u2019s a worm inside.\nHoward: Okay, calm down. There\u2019s a theme to this weekend. We are going to Mexico in Feynman\u2019s van to stay at the vacation house Feynman bought with the money from his Nobel Prize.\nSheldon: Viva la Imodium. Ay-ay-ay.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment.\nBernadette: Come on, Leonard\u2019s doing bachelor stuff. You sure we can\u2019t take you to a strip club?\nPenny: Nah, if I want to see a naked dancing man, I just flush the toilet while Leonard\u2019s in the shower.\nAmy (entering): Hi.\nPenny: Hey.\nAmy: I know we\u2019re not making a fuss, but in the spirit of bachelorette parties, I made cookies in the shape of male genitals.\nPenny: You really didn\u2019t have to, whoa! That is anatomic.\nAmy: Thank you. The veins are gummy worms.\nBernadette: Oh, look, Jewish and gentile.\nAmy: I had extra dough.\nPenny (reading text): Oh, that\u2019s Leonard. He said they\u2019re about to cross the border.\nBernadette: I hope the boys don\u2019t get too crazy in Mexico.\nPenny: Oh, yeah, right. Lock up your daughters or Sheldon might lecture them about the North American Free Trade Agreement.\nAmy: Boy, that was a long night for me.\nScene: The van.\nSheldon: Uh-oh. According to this Mexican customs website, visitors may not bring more than five laser discs, 20 compact discs or 12 VHS tapes.\nRaj: We don\u2019t have any of those.\nSheldon: How can you be sure? VHS was king when Feynman drove this van. For all we know, there are hidden compartments lousy with Jane Fonda workout videos.\nLeonard: If there was a hidden compartment, don\u2019t you think you\u2019d be stuffed in it by now?\nSheldon: Are we all up to date on our yellow fever inoculations?\nHoward: You don\u2019t need a yellow fever shot to go to Mexico.\nSheldon: You can never be too careful. I got one last year before I went to Epcot.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment. \nAmy: So, Penny, how\u2019s married life?\nPenny: Oh, it\u2019s good. I just wish Leonard would work up the courage to tell Sheldon he\u2019s moving in here.\nBernadette: You guys still aren\u2019t living together?\nPenny: We are. I mean, he sleeps here. But it\u2019s only a matter of time before Sheldon has a bad dream and tries to climb into bed with the Leonard-shaped pile of pillows.\nBernadette: Speaking of Sheldon, how\u2019s single life treating you?\nAmy: Fine, I guess. I\u2019ve been focusing on me. I was thinking about changing my wardrobe.\nPenny: Yes.\nBernadette: Good for you.\nAmy: But then I decided I don\u2019t want to go changing who I am just because of some man.\nPenny: Yes.\nBernadette: Good for you.\nPenny: You know, it is normal to want to change your look after a breakup.\nAmy: Actually, I was thinking of making one small change.\nBernadette: Your sweater?\nPenny: Your glasses?\nBernadette: Your hair?\nPenny: Your shoes.\nAmy: Piercing my ears.\nPenny: Oh.\nBernadette: You really never had that done?\nAmy: My mom said pierced ears were for whores, pirates and genies.\nPenny: Okay, well, you\u2019re a grown woman now.\nAmy: I know, but Sheldon had this clause in the Relationship Agreement forbidding cosmetic surgery unless it\u2019s to look like a Klingon.\nBernadette: We\u2019ll take you to the mall to get it done.\nPenny: Why? I can do it right here.\nAmy: Really? You have a piercing gun?\nPenny: No. All you need is a needle and an ice cube. I\u2019ve done it, like, a dozen times.\nAmy: Oh, I don\u2019t know.\nPenny: Oh, come on. I\u2019ll be gentle. Let me take your ear virginity.\nBernadette: This party\u2019s weird.\nScene: The van.\nLeonard: Hey, watch your speed. I hear the Mexican police target tourists.\nHoward: Oh, not a problem. If anything goes down, we just put Koothrappali in the driver\u2019s seat and slap a sombrero on his head.\nRaj: Dude, how many races can you offend in a single breath?\nHoward: I don\u2019t know. Have you watched the Olympics with me?\nLeonard: Sheldon, can you believe that we\u2019re driving in a van that was owned by one of the greatest scientific minds of the 20th century? It\u2019s like the Batmobile. If Batman was real and a physicist and his car wasn\u2019t cool.\nSheldon: It is extraordinary.\nRaj: Perhaps some of his mojo will rub off on us. Maybe between this and his beach house, we will be inspired to greatness.\nSheldon: I usually don\u2019t put too much stock in charms and talismans. However, even I must admit feeling Richard Feynman\u2019s butt dent cupping my own bottom that does get the creative juices flowing.\nHoward: Hey, I have to return this van. Keep your creative juices in your pants.\nSheldon: What was that?\nHoward: I think it\u2019s a tyre.\nSheldon: What if it\u2019s banditos shooting at us? What if we get kidnapped? What if we end up in a factory making Bart Simpson pi\u00f1atas for the rest of our lives?\nHoward: It\u2019s the tyre.\nSheldon: Leonard?\nLeonard: What?\nSheldon: I am getting too old for this crud.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment.\nBernadette: Amy, I noticed your status still says in a relationship on Facebook.\nAmy: You\u2019re right. I should probably let all of my Facebook friends know. Penny, I\u2019m no longer in a relationship.\nBernadette: Did you change yours to married yet?\nPenny: Uh, no, not yet. There\u2019s still a few people I haven\u2019t told personally.\nAmy: Who?\nPenny: Oh, just my parents and my entire family.\nBernadette: What?\nAmy: Why?\nPenny: Well, I don\u2019t want to hurt my dad. You know, he always wanted to dance with his daughter at her wedding.\nBernadette: What about your sister\u2019s wedding?\nPenny: They started to, then her water broke. You know, if he finds out we eloped, it\u2019s gonna break his heart.\nAmy: How long do you think you can keep it from him?\nBernadette: Yeah, isn\u2019t it gonna get worse the longer you wait?\nPenny: Well, not necessarily. You know, Dad\u2019s not getting any younger, so if I wait long enough, I\u2019ll just tell him he walked me down the aisle and it was magical.\nScene: Mexico.\nRaj: When did you learn how to change a tyre?\nHoward: Every self-respecting gentleman should know how in case he comes across a damsel in distress by the side of the road.\nSheldon: If I see one scorpion, I am getting on someone\u2019s shoulders and never coming down.\nLeonard: And there\u2019s your damsel.\nHoward: Wow, this one\u2019s really stuck.\nRaj: Are you turning it the right way?\nHoward: No. I took the other four off and when I got to this one, I thought, you know, I\u2019m in a rut, let\u2019s shake things up.\nRaj: Here, let me try. You\u2019re right, it doesn\u2019t turn the other way.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment. \nPenny: There you go. You\u2019re all done.\nAmy: That wasn\u2019t so bad. Nice. Boy, if my mom could see me now, she\u2019d lock me in the sin closet.\nBernadette: That\u2019s a joke, right?\nAmy: Actually, the joke was on her. I could still see the TV through the slats.\nPenny: I\u2019m starting to see why you and your mom aren\u2019t very close.\nBernadette: Bet she\u2019d still tell her if she got married.\nPenny: You\u2019re not gonna let this go, are you?\nAmy: Well, it\u2019s kind of sad that they don\u2019t know. I mean, they love Leonard.\nPenny: Fine, you want me to call? I\u2019ll call. Why am I so nervous?\nBernadette: It\u2019s understandable. Amy was afraid to tell her mom she broke up with Sheldon.\nPenny: Yeah? How did it go? Did she make you crawl into the breaking-up drawer?\nAmy: Uh, well, actually, to be honest, I haven\u2019t told her yet.\nPenny: You\u2019ve been giving me a hard time and you haven\u2019t even told your mom about Sheldon?\nAmy: I\u2019m feeling a little dizzy from all the blood loss. I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\nPenny: Fine. I\u2019m calling home, but when I\u2019m done, you\u2019re calling your mother.\nAmy: Easy for you to say. You never had to watch 60 Minutes like this.\nPenny: Hey, Daddy.\nPenny\u2019s Dad: Hey, slugger. How\u2019s my girl?\nPenny: Uh, good. Is Mom around?\nPenny\u2019s Dad: Ah, she took your brother out to celebrate. He just got his tenth one-month sober chip. Yeah, she\u2019s gonna make him a little necklace.\nPenny: Okay, I\u2019ll talk to her later. Uh, Dad, there\u2019s something I need to tell you. Leonard and I got married.\nPenny\u2019s Dad: You did? When?\nPenny: Last week. I\u2019m sorry, I should\u2019ve told you. It was a spur of the moment thing. I feel terrible. Please don\u2019t be too disappointed.\nPenny\u2019s Dad: Are you happy?\nPenny: Very. Leonard is so great.\nPenny\u2019s Dad: Well, then I\u2019m happy for you.\nPenny: Aw, thank you, Daddy. That means so much.\nPenny\u2019s Dad: Well, I understand it\u2019s hard to tell someone something if you think it\u2019s gonna upset \u2019em.\nPenny: It is. You\u2019re the best dad ever.\nPenny\u2019s Dad: Yeah. Uh, hold that thought. I\u2019ve been sitting on a little news myself.\nPenny: Well, what is it?\nPenny\u2019s Dad: You know that rototiller I got for the tractor?\nPenny: No.\nPenny\u2019s Dad: Oh, you should see it. It is a beautiful piece of machinery. Anyway, uh, I backed over your pet pig with it.\nPenny: Moondance?\nPenny\u2019s Dad: Yeah, he\u2019s, uh, not dancing anymore.\nPenny: You killed my pig?\nPenny\u2019s Dad: I did not kill him. The vet took care of that.\nPenny: When?\nPenny\u2019s Dad: Oh, ten, twelve months ago.\nPenny: You didn\u2019t tell me for a year?\nPenny\u2019s Dad: Well, apple doesn\u2019t fall far from the tree, does it? Love ya, slugger. Gotta go.\nBernadette: Okay, Amy, your turn.\nScene: Mexico.\nHoward: What are you doing?\nRaj: It\u2019s called Lamaze breathing. It helps you push.\nHoward: Great. He\u2019s pushing with his uterus.\nRaj: There\u2019s got to be a smarter way of removing it.\nLeonard: Yeah, this is nothing more than a physics problem.\nSheldon: Right. Archimedes once said give me a lever long enough and a fulcrum on which to place it, and I shall move the world.\nRaj: Of course. All we need is to find stuff to make a lever big enough to fix this.\nHoward: Exactly. I\u2019ll bet there\u2019s something around here that could be a lever.\nLeonard: Let\u2019s see, a lever, a lever.\nSheldon: Everybody hold on. Let\u2019s take this problem one step at a time. First, we need to decide whether we\u2019re calling it leever or lehver. And the sooner we decide it\u2019s leever, the sooner we can roll up our sleeves, not slehves, and get to work.\nLeonard: We\u2019re gonna be here foreever.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment.\nPenny: Thanks a lot, guys.\nBernadette: What did we do?\nPenny: Before I made that call, my pig was alive and happy and rolling around in the mud. Now he\u2019s illegally buried in our backyard next to my great-grandmother.\nBernadette: Really? They didn\u2019t eat him?\nPenny: No. He was a beloved member of the family.\nBernadette: The breakfast meat family?\nPenny: It\u2019s not funny. You\u2019re up. Call your mother.\nAmy: Oh, maybe later. Your pig dying made me sad. And a little hungry.\nPenny: Phone, now.\nAmy: Okay. Okay. Fine. Hi, Mom.\nPenny: Try dialing.\nAmy: You saw that, huh? Hi, Mom. How are you doing? Oh, good. How\u2019s work? That\u2019s nice. I\u2019m fine. Hey, listen, I\u2019ve been meaning to ask, how come Aunt Doe and Aunt Florence never got along?\nPenny: Okay, just give me that. Amy broke up with Sheldon, she got her ears pierced and she made us eat penis cookies. Hang on. She wants to talk to you.\nScene: Mexico.\nLeonard: I don\u2019t think the lever\u2019s working.\nHoward: What makes you say that?\nLeonard: There\u2019s gotta be something else we could try.\nRaj: If this was Star Trek, we could use a phaser to blast it off.\nHoward: No, it\u2019s too broad of a beam. You\u2019d need something more precise, like Superman\u2019s heat vision.\nSheldon: Ooh, the Green Lantern\u2019s ring could make a big green hand that unscrews it.\nRaj: If you need a green hand, why not just use the Hulk?\nSheldon: Oh, please, the Hulk would never get across the border with that temper.\nLeonard: Guys, excuse me, not that calling one of the Avengers isn\u2019t a perfectly reasonable choice, but we\u2019re scientists. Don\u2019t you think we can figure this out using actual science?\nSheldon: Yes, we could use science. But it\u2019s your bachelor party. Lighten up.\nCaption: Scientific Principle: Percussive Shock.\nHoward (singing): We will, we will percussive shock you.\nHoward and Raj (singing): We will, we will percussive shock you.\nSheldon (singing): Buddy you\u2019re a boy, make a big noise playin\u2019 in the street, gonna be a big man someday. You got mud on your face, you big disgrace, kickin\u2019 your can all over the place. I have an eidetic memory. Sometimes it\u2019s a curse.\nCaption: Scientific Principle: Thermal Expansion.\nRaj: I had no idea tortilla chips were such a good fuel source.\nLeonard: They\u2019re basically pure hydrocarbons soaked in fat. Let\u2019s hope the lug nut expands.\nSheldon: What if that burning food attracts animals?\nHoward: We have plenty of food for the animals.\nSheldon: We do?\nHoward: Yep. A six-foot wiener in a Flash T-shirt.\nSheldon: That\u2019s not very nice.\nLeonard: It\u2019s a bachelor party. Lighten up.\nCaption: Scientific Principle: Accelerated Corrosion.\nSheldon: What is that awful smell?\nHoward: It\u2019s burning salsa. I\u2019m hoping the acidity and salinity combined with electricity will corrode the lug nut off.\nSheldon: What an innovative solution. Perhaps I don\u2019t give your MIT education enough credit.\nHoward: Yeah, I saw it on Mythbusters.\nCaption: Scientific Principle: Exothermic Reaction.\nSheldon: All right, this rust, combined with the aluminium recovered from the van, is now thermite.\nHoward: Great. Couple of pinches ought to do the trick.\nRaj: Is that enough to melt the lug nut?\nLeonard: Well, let\u2019s start small. We can always add more.\nHoward: You put up a good fight, lug nut, but you\u2019ve met your match.\nScene: A moment later, next to the burning van.\nRaj: Hey, look, the lug nut\u2019s off.\nScene: The stairwell.\nPenny: What? What are you doing back?\nLeonard: We got a flat and couldn\u2019t get the tyre off.\nPenny: Oh, I\u2019m sorry.\nLeonard: Thank you.\nPenny: If it makes you feel any better, I pierced Amy\u2019s ears and her mom made her sit in my closet.\nSheldon: We blew up Feynman\u2019s van.\nPenny: My dad killed my pig with his tractor.\nLeonard: I spent the night in Mexico with Sheldon.\nPenny: You win.\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "8_11": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The apartment. \nPenny: Hey, how are things going with your parents?\nRaj; Not great. They hired divorce attorneys.\nSheldon: You know, speaking of attorneys, if I ever needed a lawyer, I would not hire She-Hulk.\nPenny: You know what? That was almost on topic. I\u2019m gonna say good job, Sheldon.\nAmy: Wait, She-Hulk\u2019s a lawyer?\nHoward: Yeah, she works at a law firm in New York.\nSheldon: Yes, but she\u2019s the only monster at the firm. Between you, me and the wall, I think she\u2019s an affirmative action hire.\nRaj: Anyway, Dad\u2019s gonna be here in town, so I won\u2019t be able to do Christmas dinner this year.\nAmy: If you\u2019re not up to hosting Christmas dinner, I\u2019m happy to do it. You can even bring your father.\nRaj: That would be nice.\nAmy: I\u2019ve always wanted to do a traditional Victorian Christmas. Parlour games, goose and figgy pudding.\nSheldon: Ugh. English pudding. You get yourself all excited for pudding, and here comes a cake with raisins in it. I\u2019m not going.\nAmy: You\u2019re going.\nSheldon: Why do you hate me?\nAmy: I don\u2019t hate you. I love you.\nSheldon: Well, you call it love, but it has a lot of raisins in it.\nRaj: Amy, good luck getting these guys excited about a dinner with a theme. I gave up when no one cared about my Tom Hanks-giving.\nBernadette: I think a Victorian Christmas sounds nice.\nHoward: I agree.\nLeonard: Why not?\nPenny: Me, too.\nRaj: You guys suck.\nCredits sequence. \nScene: The University clean room.\nLeonard: You know the best part of working in the clean room? No allergies. Check it out. Oh, that, that, that\u2019s a lot of oxygen.\nHoward: We should get going to Amy\u2019s.\nLeonard: Can you believe there was a time when we would have needed an array of giant Cherenkov telescopes to detect cosmic particles? And here we are building our own multi-wire detector like a couple of badasses.\nHoward: I know. If we were still single, we\u2019d be tripping over all that booty.\nLeonard: Ladies do love a man dressed like a kitchen garbage bag. Oh, no.\nHoward: How the hell did a pigeon get in here?\nLeonard: You shut the loading doors, right?\nHoward: I thought you did.\nLeonard: Do you know what a disaster this is?\nHoward: You mean \u2019cause this room isn\u2019t supposed to have dust in it, and we just let in a flying crap machine?\nLeonard: What do we do? Should we call someone?\nHoward: And tell them that we compromised all the equipment? Let\u2019s just get it out of here before anyone knows.\nLeonard: Okay, how do we catch it?\nHoward: Well, what if we turn off all the lights except for one, and it\u2019ll come to it.\nLeonard: It\u2019s not a moth.\nHoward: Don\u2019t yell at me. You\u2019re not gonna get any good ideas out of me if you\u2019re yelling.\nLeonard: Okay, so if I remain calm, I\u2019ll get more gems like turn off the lights?\nHoward: Great, we\u2019re turning on each other. That\u2019s just what the bird wants us to do.\nScene: Amy\u2019s apartment. \nPenny: So, Dr. Koothrappali, long flight?\nDr Koothrappali: Twenty hours.\nPenny: Oh, that\u2019s rough.\nDr Koothrappali: Not at all. Did you know that when you fly transcontinental without your wife, you don\u2019t pray for the plane to crash?\nRaj: Can we please talk about anything else?\nDr Koothrappali: Forgive me. How are you and Leonard?\nPenny: Oh, great. Everything\u2019s good.\nDr Koothrappali: I see you got engaged.\nPenny: Yes, we did.\nDr Koothrappali: Let me tell you a story.\nRaj: Dad.\nDr Koothrappali: Sorry. I\u2019m sure you won\u2019t grow to hate each other.\nRaj (on phone): Hey, Leonard. What\u2019s up? What? How did that happen? Yeah, okay. I\u2019ll be there as soon as I can. Sorry. I have to run to the university.\nAmy: What\u2019s going on?\nRaj: There\u2019s been a problem with an experiment. A bird got into the clean room.\nDr Koothrappali: You want me to come?\nRaj: Uh, no. You had a long flight. You stay here and relax.\nDr Koothrappali: Relax. Easy for you to say. Your mother isn\u2019t cleaning out your bank account. Forty years, the woman never cleaned a thing.\nPenny: You\u2019re just gonna leave him here?\nDr Koothrappali: Relax, he says.\nRaj: Yup. Bye.\nScene: Bernadette\u2019s car.\nBernadette (singing): Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus, right down Santa Claus Lane. Vixen and Blitzen and all his reindeer pulling on the reins.\nSheldon: Yeah, I appreciate the ride.\nBernadette (singing): Bells are ringing, children singing, all is merry and bright. So hang your stockings and say your prayers \u2019cause Santa Claus is coming tonight. Why\u2019d you turn it off?\nSheldon: Because in the last ten minutes, Santa came to town, kissed Mommy and ran Grandma over with a reindeer. I had a drunk uncle who did all those things. Nobody sings songs about him.\nBernadette: Maybe you\u2019d like it more if you thought of Santa as a superhero and his power is bringing joy to children.\nSheldon: My uncle was accused of that, too. It turned out to be legal in Oklahoma.\nBernadette: Okay, new subject. Let\u2019s talk about presents. What did you get Amy?\nSheldon: Oh, we\u2019re not exchanging gifts.\nBernadette: Come on, Sheldon, you have to get her something.\nSheldon: Why should I? She knows that I don\u2019t like Christmas, and yet, every year, she forces me to celebrate it. Not only am I going to this foolish dinner against my will, at the Christmas tree lot, there was mistletoe, and she kissed me under it in public. Like we were the stars of a Tijuana sex show.\nBernadette: She\u2019s just excited about the holidays.\nSheldon: Yes, and she\u2019s not taking my feelings into account at all. Maybe it\u2019s time I teach her a lesson.\nBernadette: How?\nSheldon: Hmm. It\u2019d have to be something heinous, something that makes her as miserable as she\u2019s making me. Oh, I\u2019ve got it. This is good.\nBernadette: What?\nSheldon: I\u2019m going to buy her a present.\nBernadette: Yeah, you\u2019re gonna have to walk me through that.\nSheldon: With gift-giving, there\u2019s an implied social contract. If I show up tonight with a present, and she doesn\u2019t have one for me, she\u2019ll feel terrible.\nBernadette: Then you\u2019re both sad?\nSheldon: Yes. Maybe she\u2019ll feel so guilty, she\u2019ll never make me celebrate the holidays again.\nBernadette: So your evil plot here is to buy your girlfriend a present?\nSheldon: That\u2019s right. So stay on my good side, or I\u2019ll get you a little something, too.\nScene: The clean room. \nHoward: Okay, here\u2019s the plan. I\u2019m gonna put the food in the bag, and when he lands in the bag to eat it, we close it up.\nLeonard: A Slim Jim?\nHoward: It\u2019s all I could find. It\u2019ll work.\nLeonard: Sure. If the pigeon\u2019s stoned or a trucker.\nHoward: Okay, well, what\u2019s your plan?\nLeonard: I told you my plan. Let\u2019s call Building Services and get help.\nHoward: And admit that we contaminated the clean room?\nLeonard: No, admit that you contaminated the clean room.\nHoward: Why do you keep assuming it was me?\nLeonard: Because you do this kind of thing all the time, and then you try to cover it up.\nHoward: Like when?\nLeonard: What about when you flipped the Mars Rover, or lost Koothrappali\u2019s dog, or almost drove off with that baby?\nHoward: Again, it looked like my car, and the baby didn\u2019t even cry until his mother punched me with her keys.\nLeonard: Fine, put the Slim Jim in the garbage bag.\nHoward: Well, what if you said it without sounding so condescending?\nLeonard: I can try, but your plan has the words garbage bag and Slim Jim in it.\nRaj: Hey, what\u2019s going on?\nLeonard: Oh. Genius here wants to catch a bird with a garbage bag and a Slim Jim.\nRaj: Should have put it in the bag first.\nScene: Amy\u2019s apartment.\nPenny: So, if you don\u2019t mind me asking, do you think you might start dating again?\nDr Koothrappali: It\u2019s much too soon for that. Why? Do you know someone?\nPenny: No, but if things don\u2019t work out with me and Leonard, I\u2019ll give you a call. Wait. How much do you talk about Star Trek?\nAmy: Okay, let\u2019s get this Victorian party started. I\u2019ve done some research about some traditional parlour games we can play.\nPenny: Like what?\nAmy: Well, there\u2019s a fun one called Ball of Wool. You take a ball of wool, and you put it right in the centre of the table. Then people sit on opposite sides of the table and try to blow the wool off.\nPenny: Sorry. She\u2019s taken, too.\nScene: The clean room.\nHoward: You know what I think your problem is? You\u2019re jealous because you and I used to be best friends until Koothrappali came along.\nLeonard: And you found somebody you could push around?\nRaj: Hey.\nHoward: Stay out of this.\nRaj: Okay.\nHoward: You know, maybe I\u2019m best friends with Raj because he doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s smarter than me.\nRaj: Actually.\nHoward: I said, stay out of it.\nLeonard: No, no, no. No, Raj, go ahead, say what you were gonna say.\nRaj: All I\u2019m gonna say is you guys need to stop this right now. It. it\u2019s bad enough that my parents are fighting, now I have to hear the two of you? And who cares who\u2019s smarter? If it\u2019s Leonard or me or, you know, it\u2019s Christmas, let\u2019s say it\u2019s Howard.\nHoward: Well, if you\u2019re so smart, you get the bird out.\nRaj: No, you\u2019re the one who let him in.\nHoward: How do you know it wasn\u2019t Leonard?\nRaj: Come on.\nScene: A shopping mall.\nBernadette: What about that sweater?\nSheldon: No, it\u2019s not good enough. It has to be perfect.\nBernadette: I think the nicest gifts I\u2019ve got from Howie show how well he knows me.\nSheldon: Hmm. Let\u2019s see, what do I know about Amy? She loves medieval literature, Chaucer\u2019s her favourite. And her eyes sparkle when she watches old French movies. I enjoy how harp music causes her fingers to dance as if she\u2019s playing along.\nBernadette: Wow, you really do love her.\nSheldon: I do. Now, let\u2019s find the kind of gift that makes her feel small and worthless.\nScene: Amy\u2019s apartment. \nAmy: You won.\nPenny: Certainly doesn\u2019t feel like it, does it?\nDr Koothrappali: You know, my wife used to throw theme parties like this all the time.\nPenny: Oh, I guess that\u2019s where Raj gets it from.\nDr Koothrappali: Well, he and his mother spent a lot of time together when he was young. I was always working.\nPenny: Hey, you know, Raj is dating a doctor who works a lot. Him and his mom have a type. You, you got to laugh at that, right? No? All right.\nScene: Santa\u2019s grotto. \nSanta: All right, let me see if I\u2019ve got this straight. A picture of you on my lap is a way to punish your girlfriend for making you celebrate Christmas?\nSheldon: Correct.\nSanta: Santa thinks dating you may be punishment enough.\nSheldon: There\u2019s an argument for that. But I want to make sure.\nPhotographer: Smile.\nSanta: Ho, ho. ho.\nScene: The clean room.\nLeonard: Okay. On the count of three, I\u2019ll shoot the fire extinguisher and get him airborne. Howard, you wave the blanket and guide him towards the exit. Raj, you hold open the curtain so he can fly out.\nHoward: Are you sure a dummy like me can handle something as complicated as a blanket?\nLeonard: Do you want the fire extinguisher?\nHoward: Yeah, I do.\nLeonard: Great. Here you go.\nHoward: Okay. One, two, three.\nRaj: Uh, you have to take the pin out.\nLeonard: You miss the blanket now, don\u2019t you?\nHoward: On three. One, two, three.\nRaj: What did you do?\nHoward: It was an accident. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.\nLeonard: Relax, it wasn\u2019t your fault.\nHoward: Uh, maybe it\u2019s just stunned.\nRaj: Dude, it\u2019s not breathing.\nHoward: Oh, no. I killed it. Oh, not again.\nRaj: What do you mean, not again?\nHoward: When I was ten, I was playing in my backyard and sat on a blue jay. I mean, I tried to bring it back to life with electricity, but it just caught on fire. The worst part was it smelled delicious.\nLeonard: Uh, guys, I found an article here that says you can do CPR on birds.\nHoward: Great. Do it.\nLeonard: I\u2019m not doing it. You killed him, you do it.\nRaj: I\u2019ll do it.\nHoward: No. I need to do it. This is on me.\nLeonard: Okay. Mouth over beak and light chest compressions.\nRaj: Don\u2019t blow too hard. If you pop him, I will vomit.\nLeonard: Anything?\nHoward: I am tasting a lot of Slim Jim.\nLeonard: Wait, wait, his wing moved.\nHoward: Oh, he blinked his eyes. He\u2019s alive.\nRaj: It\u2019s a Christmas miracle.\nHoward: I might argue a Hanukkah miracle, but I\u2019ll take it. Come on, little guy, let\u2019s get you outside. Get the curtain.\nRaj: Someone should really close that loading door.\nScene: The same, later.\nRaj: Well, that\u2019s that. The room\u2019s compromised. They\u2019ll have to change all the filters, probably shut it down for weeks.\nHoward: You were right. Go ahead, call Building Services. Tell them it was my fault.\nLeonard: No, we\u2019re both to blame. You know, let me take the heat on this one.\nRaj: Yeah, just leave me out of it. You know if they come here and see crap everywhere, they\u2019re just gonna blame the Indian guy.\nLeonard (on phone): Hey. I\u2019m sorry, we\u2019re still here. Is everything okay?\nPenny: It\u2019s kind of boring. Although it did get exciting for a minute when Amy inhaled a wool ball. How much longer do you think you\u2019ll be?\nLeonard: I don\u2019t know. There\u2019s still a bird in here. We are gonna get in a ton of trouble.\nPenny: Honey, it\u2019s Christmas Eve. Who even knows you\u2019re in there?\nLeonard: No, our names are on the sign-in sheet.\nPenny: So erase them and walk out.\nLeonard: I can\u2019t do that.\nHoward: Can\u2019t do what?\nLeonard: She says take our names off the sign-in sheet and leave.\nHoward: We can\u2019t do that.\nLeonard: Yeah.\nScene: Leonard\u2019s car.\nLeonard, Howard and Raj (singing): Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way. Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh, hey.\nScene: Amy\u2019s apartment. \nRaj: Mmm. Amy, that pudding was delicious.\nSheldon: If you like raisins.\nAmy: Thank you. And it\u2019s figs.\nSheldon: Oh. Oh, in that case, it was pretty good.\nBernadette: You feeling okay? You hardly touched your goose.\nHoward: It smelled too much like blue jay.\nDr Koothrappali: Can I help you clean up?\nAmy: Oh, you Heimliched a ball of wool out of me; you\u2019re good.\nSheldon: Uh, what do you say we exchange gifts?\nPenny: Oh, Sheldon, we didn\u2019t bring any.\nLeonard: I thought you hate giving gifts.\nSheldon: Yeah, I do. Which is why I got Amy this.\nAmy: You got me something?\nSheldon: Oh, not just something, no. It\u2019s from the heart, it\u2019s holiday-themed, and I swallowed the gift receipt so you cannot return it.\nAmy: Look at you on Santa\u2019s lap. That\u2019s so sweet.\nSheldon: Of course it is. It\u2019s the perfect gift. How are you feeling right now? Guilty? Sad? Wishing you were Jewish?\nAmy: No, I love it.\nSheldon: Oh, really? Well, how about now? (On recording) Happy holidays to my dear Amy. I hope you treasure this as much as I treasure you. (Not on recording) And you got me nothing. Christmas is ruined. Let\u2019s never speak of it again. Well, this was fun.\nAmy: Actually, I did get you something.\nSheldon: But what about our agreement?\nAmy: Well, you got me something. Here.\nSheldon: Cookies?\nAmy: They\u2019re your Meemaw\u2019s Christmas cookies. I called and got the recipe.\nSheldon: They\u2019re perfect. It tastes like her hugs.\nAmy: Merry Christmas, Sheldon.\nSheldon: I can\u2019t believe this. You\u2019re happy, I\u2019m happy. Well, maybe a holiday that\u2019s all about giving isn\u2019t so\u2026 Get your hand out of that box.\nScene: The same, later.\nAmy: Okay. The next game is called Hot Boiled Beans.\nPenny: Of course it is.\nAmy: One person is sent out of the room while the others hide a small item. Then they invite the first person back by saying hot boiled beans and bacon for supper, hurry up before it gets cold.\nRaj: If you people think this is better than Tom Hanks-giving, you\u2019re all crazy.\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "8_21": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The cafeteria.\nSheldon: Hey, would you like to hear some songs I\u2019ve rewritten to get children interested in the hard sciences?\nHoward: Sure.\nLeonard: Really?\nHoward: Yeah. Well, I like music, I like science, I like making fun of Sheldon. Hit it.\nSheldon: There was a scientist who had a theory and James Clerk Maxwell was his name-o. J-A-M-E-S, C-L-E-R-K space M-A-X-W-E-L-L, And James Clerk Maxwell was his name-o. There was a scientist who had a theory and James Clerk Maxwell was his name-o, A-M-E-S\u2026\nLeonard: Uh, okay, okay. Uh, we, we get it.\nSheldon: Perhaps you\u2019d prefer this one. The itsy bitsy spider is not an insect at all, because it haseight legs and two body parts.\nLeonard: That\u2019s pretty cool, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Thank you. Do either of you know Beyonc\u00e9? I\u2019d love her to get behind it.\nRaj: Hey.\nLeonard: Hey.\nHoward: Hey.\nSheldon: Hello.\nRaj: You guys know the new Discovery class missions that NASA\u2019s been working on?\nLeonard: Yeah.\nRaj: Well, they\u2019re looking to include a message from Earth in case one of them is encountered by alien life.\nLeonard: Oh. When I encountered alien life, I discovered that the key thing was not to sit in its spot.\nSheldon: All right, you can\u2019t breathe our air without an inhaler, he\u2019s allergic to Earth nuts, but I\u2019m the alien.\nRaj: Anyway, I\u2019m among a handful of scientists that have been asked to submit a design proposal for the message and its delivery system.\nSheldon: Excellent.\nHoward: Good for you.\nLeonard: Congratulations.\nRaj: And I was wondering if any of you guys would like to help me do it.\nLeonard: Are you kidding? Yes. What did you have in mind?\nSheldon: I\u2019ll tell you exactly what you should do, avoid the presumption of the Terran sensory input paradigm.\nHoward: Yeah, absolutely. You need a device capable of delivering information across a wide range of perceptual modalities.\nSheldon: Any intelligent organism would at the very least need the ability to locate the position of objects in space. So the ideal interstellar lingua franca would be haptic.\nHoward: Ooh, how about a 3-D tactile communicator rigged for cross-sensory transposition?\nRaj: Exactly what I expected. Two people forcing their ideas on me and only one gentleman who could be bothered to ask me what my thoughts were. You two are out. Congratulations, Leonard, you\u2019re on the team.\nLeonard: My mommy raised a gentleman.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: Raj\u2019s apartment.\nRaj: Hey. Thanks for coming by.\nLeonard: Yeah. I\u2019m excited to help.\nRaj: I would have included the others, but you know exactly what would\u2019ve happened. They would\u2019ve taken over the project and bossed us around.\nLeonard: I get it. Uh, just this morning, Sheldon wouldn\u2019t let me put almond milk on my Grape-Nuts because he said it was a theoretical nut conflict.\nRaj: You should have told him to mind his own business.\nLeonard: Yeah. That\u2019s better than what I did say, which was, fine, I\u2019ll eat them with club soda.\nRaj: What makes them think they\u2019re always in charge of everything?\nLeonard: Mmm, they\u2019re alpha males.\nRaj: Huh, what does that make us?\nLeonard: We could be betas. They\u2019re second in charge.\nRaj: Okay, that sounds good.\nLeonard: Or we could be omegas. They get pushed around by the alphas and the betas.\nRaj: Okay, that sounds like us.\nLeonard: Whatever. There\u2019s no alphas here, and this is your project. You\u2019re in charge. How do you want to start?\nRaj: I don\u2019t know. How do you want to start?\nLeonard: I don\u2019t know. Should we call Sheldon and Howard?\nRaj: No. We can do this by ourselves.\nLeonard: Okay. Great. How do you want to start?\nRaj: I don\u2019t know. How do you want to start?\nScene: The hallway.\nPenny: (Knock, knock, knock) Sheldon. (Knock, knock, knock) Sheldon. (Knock, knock, knock) Sheldon.\nSheldon: I bet that started off as a joke, but by the third one you realized there was something strangely enjoyable about it.\nPenny: Yeah, I kind of want to do it again.\nSheldon: I don\u2019t recommend it. You\u2019ll be doing it the rest of your life. Anyway, if you\u2019re looking for Leonard, he\u2019s with Koothrappali.\nPenny: Uh, no, I actually came to talk to you.\nSheldon: How nice. Here are some topics that interest me, quantum mechanics, trains, flags.\nPenny: No, no. It\u2019s about my acting career.\nSheldon: Oh, sorry. That\u2019s not on the list.\nPenny: Well.\nSheldon: Oh, wait. No. How about we split the difference and discuss why Austria was an archduchy and not just a regular duchy.\nPenny: Okay, look, here\u2019s the thing. I like pharmaceutical sales, it\u2019s going great, but I have an audition for a movie, and if I get it, it could screw everything up.\nSheldon: Hmm. I know exactly what you should do. Unfortunately, I cannot tell you.\nPenny: Well, why?\nSheldon: I\u2019m attempting to turn over a new leaf. Earlier today, it was pointed out to me that I tend to force my ideas on people.\nPenny: You\u2019re really not gonna tell me?\nSheldon: No, that train has left the station. Now, we can play this one of two ways. You can say, trains, tell me more, or you can just look at me like that and I\u2019ll start.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s house.\nBernadette: What\u2019s going on in here?\nHoward: I am making molecular cocktails. This sphere is actually a cosmopolitan.\nBernadette: Oh. How do you drink it?\nHoward: Oh, just put it in your mouth and pop it like a zit.\nBernadette: I think I\u2019ll have a beer.\nHoward: First take a picture with me.\nBernadette: Why?\nHoward: Well, Raj and I always talked about learning how to make cocktails like this together, so I taught myself and I\u2019m putting this on Instagram so he can see it and feel like a turd. Say cheese.\nBernadette: Is this about the space probe he\u2019s working on without you?\nHoward: You betcha. The very one.\nBernadette: Howard, you\u2019re grown men. You guys don\u2019t have to do everything together.\nHoward: I know. That\u2019s why I\u2019m spending tonight with you.\nBernadette: Trying to hurt Raj\u2019s feelings.\nHoward: With my honeybunch.\nBernadette: You\u2019re being childish.\nHoward: No. He is. So I have a dominant personality. We all know that.\nBernadette: I\u2019m sorry. What do we know?\nHoward: In social groupings, I just naturally wind up in charge.\nBernadette: Don\u2019t take this the wrong way, but how many of these little booze balls have you had?\nHoward: You don\u2019t think I\u2019m a leader?\nBernadette: I was kidding. Of course you are.\nHoward: Right. I couldn\u2019t change if I wanted to.\nBernadette: You better not change, because I love who you are. Now, will you need help cleaning all this up when you\u2019re done or can you do it all by yourself?\nHoward: All by myself.\nBernadette: There\u2019s my big boss man.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: So, often on the front of the locomotive is a large iron wedge for clearing objects off the tracks. Now, while commonly known as a cowcatcher, I prefer the more accurate cow exploder.\nPenny: Okay. Sheldon, let me ask you a question.\nSheldon: Mmm.\nPenny: If I was at a train station and one train could take me to my current job and the other train could take me to an audition for a movie, which train should I get on?\nSheldon: Are you using trains to trick me into giving you advice?\nPenny: No.\nSheldon: All right, then. You should take a third train where you audition for the movie but hold off on making a career decision until you have more information.\nPenny: Oh. You\u2019re right. I\u2019m worried about something that hasn\u2019t even happened yet. Huh. You are a wise man.\nSheldon: Well, Penny, who\u2019s smarter, the wise man or the person who comes to him for advice?\nPenny: Oh, I guess you\u2019re right. Maybe it is the person who asks.\nSheldon: No, it\u2019s the wise man. That\u2019s why he\u2019s called the wise man. You know how I know that? I\u2019m the wise man.\nPenny: I\u2019m sorry. What was I thinking?\nSheldon: Uh, just out of curiosity, why didn\u2019t you ask Leonard for advice about this?\nPenny: \u2018Cause I already know what he\u2019ll say. Wah, wah, wah, you shouldn\u2019t do it.\nSheldon: Ah, it\u2019s just like he\u2019s here.\nScene: Raj\u2019s apartment. \nRaj: Okay, so we know that previous attempts to send a message into space, like the Golden Record on Voyager, were heavily criticized.\nLeonard: Well, aliens could only play the Golden Record if they figured out how to build a record player.\nRaj: Eh. Although, to be fair, I watched E.T. build a telephone out of a Speak & Spell and an umbrella. Dude was like a little brown MacGyver.\nLeonard: That would be more helpful if E.T. were real.\nRaj: Well, my feelings were real when he was about to die.\nLeonard: My God, when he\u2019s on the table and they use the paddles on him.\nRaj: And he\u2019s all white.\nLeonard: They zip him up in that bag.\nRaj: And Gertie can\u2019t stop crying.\nLeonard: The flower dies.\nRaj: Okay, let\u2019s talk about something else.\nLeonard: All right, so it sounds like we need a way to communicate that\u2019s simple.\nRaj: And doesn\u2019t require outside machinery to be built to access it.\nLeonard: It\u2019s also a problem because we don\u2019t even know if the aliens who find this can see. I mean, they might communicate in a totally different way than us.\nRaj: Like when my dog is mad at me, she tells me by peeing in my slippers.\nLeonard: That\u2019s actually a valid example. Animals do deliver messages through scent.\nRaj: Bees talk to each other by dancing. Whales have their songs.\nLeonard: Yeah. Penny has about twenty different ways of rolling her eyes that each mean something different.\nRaj: Okay, so, what it sounds like is, what we want is a device that can deliver a message through not only sight, but other senses, as well.\nLeonard: The most basic sense that any space-faring civilization would have to possess is touch.\nRaj: Ooh. Ooh, ooh. We could make a video-playing device that simultaneously translates the information into a tactile medium.\nLeonard: All we have to do is rig up a 3-D communication system.\nRaj: We, we can totally do that.\nLeonard: I know.\nRaj: This is great.\nLeonard: Yeah, you know what else it is?\nRaj: What?\nHoward: Exactly what Sheldon and Howard said.\nRaj: Well, thank you for peeing in my slippers.\nScene: The cafeteria.\nSheldon (singing): It\u2019s the eye of the tiger, it\u2019s the ear of the bat, it\u2019s the whiskers of the catfish and the walrus.\nHoward: Hang on. Not that your song isn\u2019t terrible, it is. but how do you mention bats and leave out sonar?\nSheldon: You didn\u2019t let me finish. And also regarding the bat, it has sonar.\nLeonard: Hey.\nHoward: Hello.\nRaj: Look, I know you guys are upset, but we\u2019ve talked about it, and we think it\u2019d be beneficial for you to be part of the project.\nHoward: Well, well, well, did you hear that, Sheldon?\nSheldon: I\u2019m sorry. I was trying to think of what rhymes with nose of the aardvark.\nLeonard: We want you back on the project with us.\nSheldon: Well, well, well, did you hear that, Howard?\nRaj: Look, we admit it. The idea that you guys came up with was really good, and I\u2019d love your help.\nHoward: I suppose it couldn\u2019t have been easy for you to say that.\nRaj: It wasn\u2019t, so are you in?\nSheldon: Certainly.\nHoward: Sure.\nLeonard: Great. Now that we\u2019re all on the same page, let\u2019s get together tonight and work on it.\nSheldon: Get together tonight? Leonard, stop trying to control everything, and give poor Raj a chance to come up with what we should do. Go ahead, Raj.\nRaj: Okay, I think we should do it right now.\nSheldon: Tonight works better for me.\nRaj: Okay.\nScene: A hallway.\nPenny (voiceover): Okay, it\u2019s just an audition. Why am I nervous? Maybe it\u2019s a good thing. Just means I want it. And I can have it. This feels right. Why did I ever give this up? (Out loud) I\u2019m starting to remember.\nScene: The apartment. \nRaj: So, I\u2019d like to try a technique where no one gets steamrolled. When you talk, instead of bringing up a new idea, respect what was just said by building on it.\nSheldon: Uh, building on that, we should order dinner.\nLeonard: How is that building on what he just said?\nHoward: Building on what Sheldon said, I could go for Chinese.\nRaj: Hang on. Building on what Leonard said, no one built on what I said.\nSheldon: Building on building on that, there\u2019s a new build-your-own pizza place on Colorado.\nLeonard: Building on that, I\u2019d like to remind you, I\u2019m lactose intolerant.\nHoward: I saw the menu. They have soy cheese.\nSheldon: Bah, you didn\u2019t say building on. You\u2019re out.\nLeonard: It\u2019s not Simon Says.\nRaj: Yeah, you\u2019re missing the point, Sheldon.\nSheldon: You\u2019re out, and you\u2019re out. I win. Who wants pizza?\nScene: The audition room.\nGirl: Penny?\nPenny: Oh, hey.\nGirl: Hey. I haven\u2019t seen you auditioning in a while.\nPenny: Yeah, uh, I got a job as a pharmaceutical sales rep.\nGirl: You quit acting?\nPenny: Well, kind of. But now I get to act like inflamed heart is only a mild side effect.\nSecond Girl: I heard you can make good money doing that.\nPenny: Yeah, it\u2019s going okay, but I do miss this sometimes.\nFirst Girl: Really?\nPenny: Mmm.\nFirst Girl: \u2018Cause I got to tell you, I am so sick of the humiliation and being treated like a piece of meat.\nAudiitoner: Chelsea?\nFirst Girl: Wish me luck.\nSecond Girl: They\u2019re gonna love you. I heard she\u2019s pushing 40 and everything\u2019s fake.\nPenny: Yeah. I started that rumour.\nScene: The apartment. \nLeonard: Okay, since we agree on the delivery system for the message, maybe we should talk about what the message could be.\nRaj: Well, I think we should show what earthlings look like.\nHoward: The plaque they sent up on the Pioneer probe had a drawing of a naked man and woman on it.\nSheldon: Yeah, I never cared for that. It\u2019s advertising to predator races just how soft and squishy we are.\nLeonard: Squeeze yourself.\nSheldon: Oh, don\u2019t be offended. You know, of the four of us, you have the most veal-like consistency.\nRaj: Well, maybe there\u2019s a way to appear non-aggressive, but also be able to protect ourselves if necessary. Like smiling and waving with one hand, but the other hand holding the severed head of a tiger.\nHoward: You want to send a passive-aggressive message out into the universe? That\u2019s ridiculous.\nRaj: Oh, you mean passive-aggressive like posting pictures of you and your wife eating cosmopolitan balls that you know belong in my mouth?\nSheldon: Perhaps Howard meant passive-aggressive like asking our group to help on your project, and then only choosing Leonard.\nRaj: Look, I\u2019m sorry I hurt your feelings, but you do have strong personalities and always end up taking over.\nHoward: It\u2019s not always.\nLeonard: What about when we went to Comic-Con and dressed like Jabba the Hutt? You got to be Jabba\u2019s head, and I got to be his fat slug butt.\nSheldon: We looked great.\nLeonard: You let a guy sit on me.\nHoward: He was dressed as Princess Leia. It made a nice picture.\nLeonard: I\u2019m just saying, sometimes Raj and I feel pushed aside.\nRaj: Yeah. Like when you took Sheldon to Texas and showed him all around NASA, you didn\u2019t even think to ask me and Leonard.\nHoward: You know what? You\u2019re right. I should have asked you.\nSheldon: Yeah, and if he does ask you, go. It\u2019s amazing.\nHoward: Okay, and if we\u2019re talking about being left out of things, you guys went to Skywalker Ranch without us.\nSheldon: Oh, I recommend that, too. That was a magical experience.\nLeonard: Wait a minute. Sheldon spent a whole day with James Earl Jones and never told any of us.\nSheldon: I sure did. Oh, my goodness. Well, from Jabba\u2019s head to ice cream with Darth Vader, I\u2019m having a heck of a ride. Yeah, look, clearly, good things happen when I\u2019m in charge. Now, why don\u2019t you boys step aside, let me knock this project out?\nLeonard: Sheldon, you\u2019re not in charge. Raj is in charge.\nSheldon: Leonard, who\u2019s really in charge? The person in charge, or those who put him in charge?\nRaj: He\u2019s right. If you think about it, we\u2019re all in charge.\nSheldon: No, the guy in charge is in ch\u2026 why is everyone so bad at these?\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment.\nPenny: I mean, the whole experience reminded me about how much I hated about that world. You, you know, the anxiety, the depression, the negativity. I don\u2019t want to feel those things. I want to sell drugs to people who feel those things.\nAmy: I can\u2019t believe you got up and walked out of an audition for a big movie.\nPenny: I did. I mean, I walked in, read for the part, then stunk up the place, but then I walked right out.\nBernadette: Well, I\u2019m glad you have a new appreciation for your job.\nPenny: I do, and you know, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever thanked you properly for helping me get it.\nBernadette: Properly, at all. It\u2019s just words I\u2019ve never heard.\nPenny: Well, thank you. You\u2019re a good friend, and you changed my life.\nBernadette: You\u2019re welcome. Hey, now that you\u2019re making some real money, maybe you can take your friend out for a nice thank-you dinner.\nPenny: Sure.\nAmy: And you probably have to invite your other friend \u2019cause she overheard you talking about it, and it would be awkward to exclude her.\nPenny: Okay.\nBernadette: How about now?\nPenny: All right.\nBernadette: Don\u2019t forget your wallet.\nPenny: I, uh, huh.\nScene: An alien spacecraft. \nSheldon (on screen): Greetings from planet Earth. Just turn left at Alpha Centauri. You can\u2019t miss it.\nFirst Alien: That soft pink alien looks delicious.\nSecond Alien: I could eat.\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "6_13": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The apartment. Sheldon is steaming a Star Trek uniform.\nLeonard: Hey, will you steam my uniform next?\nSheldon: Interesting. Do you recall this conversation? Leonard, want to go halfsies on a steamer? No, Sheldon, we don\u2019t need a steamer. Looks like that rumpled chicken\u2019s come home to roost.\nPenny: Hi. Here are the make-up sponges you asked for.\nLeonard: Oh, thanks, I thought I had more.\nPenny: Damn, you\u2019ve got more makeup than I do. You\u2019ve got better makeup than I do. Yeah, I\u2019m borrowing this.\nLeonard: Hey, hey, hey, hey. This is my Comic-Con makeup. I love you, but there are some things a man doesn\u2019t share with his girlfriend.\nSheldon: That\u2019s a wise policy. I once borrowed my sister\u2019s makeup for a costume contest. Got a terrible case of pinkeye. But luckily, I was going as a zombie. I won second place.\nPenny: I feel like you guys just went to Comic-Con.\nLeonard: That was San Diego Comic-Con. This is Bakersfield Comic-Con.\nPenny: Is that better?\nLeonard: Well, it\u2019s a lot smaller. It\u2019s more about the comic books. The way these conventions used to be before they went all Hollywood.\nSheldon: So to answer your question, no, it\u2019s not better.\nPenny: Well, then why are you going?\nSheldon: It\u2019s a comic book convention. You know, it\u2019s like pizza or particle accelerators, even the stinky one\u2019s still pretty good.\nPenny: All right. Well, you guys have fun. I guess I\u2019ll see you Sunday night.\nLeonard: Yeah.\nPenny: Okay.\nLeonard: Oh, hang on a second. (Hands her the day\u2019s newspaper) Hold this. (Photographs the two of them together)\nPenny: What was that for?\nLeonard: To show people when they don\u2019t believe me.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: A restaurant.\nPenny: Oh, this is the best. You have booze with breakfast on a Tuesday, you got a problem. You do it on the weekend, you got brunch.\nAmy: Sheldon doesn\u2019t believe in brunch. He can\u2019t stand being at a table where one person\u2019s having an omelette and another person\u2019s having a sandwich.\nBernadette: He\u2019s not exhausting at all.\nPenny (receiving text): Oh. It\u2019s Leonard. He says they\u2019re on the road and headed for Bakersfield at warp speed. Maybe it\u2019s the mimosa, but I\u2019m gonna give the kid an LOL.\nBernadette: It\u2019s cute how excited they are. You should have seen Howard sewing his costume all week for the convention.\nAmy: When did Howard learn to sew?\nBernadette: When he was a little boy, every couple months, he would have to let his mom\u2019s pants out.\nAmy: I don\u2019t even understand why they go to these conventions.\nPenny: I know. The four of them work at a major university. They\u2019re all super smart. How can they still be into something made for 12-year-olds?\nBernadette: I don\u2019t mind it. I think Howie\u2019s just in touch with his inner child. Although when he comes to bed in his Batman pyjamas, sometimes it feels like I\u2019m touching his inner child.\nAmy: It\u2019s probably because they were bullied growing up. In a world where you can\u2019t fight back, superheroes provide meaningful wish-fulfillment.\nPenny: Mmmm. Now I feel bad for picking on all those kids. Although, in my defence, if Danny Biffle didn\u2019t want to eat a mouthful of dirt, he shouldn\u2019t have shown up to school wearing a bow tie.\nBernadette: I\u2019ve never even read a comic book. You guys?\nPenny: Uh-uh.\nAmy: No.\nBernadette: I mean, it\u2019s such an important part of their lives. Maybe we should try reading some.\nAmy: Seriously?\nBernadette: The comic book store isn\u2019t far from here.\nPenny: That is an amazing idea. Okay, how many of these have I had?\nScene: Leonard\u2019s car.\nSheldon: I think you should turn on the GPS.\nLeonard: It is on.\nSheldon: But the turn-by-turn voice option isn\u2019t on. I know I\u2019d feel more safe if you turn on the turn-by-turn voice option. I love the turn-by-turn voice option.\nHoward: Has it really only been ten miles?\nLeonard: I\u2019m turning it on, but just to shut you up.\nGPS (in Sheldon\u2019s voice): Leonard, bear left and continue on Interstate 210.\nSheldon: Ooh, sounds like that fellow knows what he\u2019s talking about. I\u2019d put on my listening ears if I were you.\nLeonard: What did you do?\nSheldon: I found a hack online. I was able to upload MP3 recordings of my voice to your GPS.\nRaj: That is so cool.\nLeonard: Counterpoint, no, it\u2019s not.\nGPS: Continue on Interstate 210 for five miles. Here\u2019s an interesting fact about interstates.\nLeonard: Really?\nSheldon: Shh, he said it\u2019s interesting.\nGPS: Interstates are numbered as follows. Even-numbered routes run east and west, odd-numbered routes run north and south. Three-digit route numbers indicate bypasses or spurs.\nHoward: Look, Leonard, there\u2019s a bridge. Drive off it.\nRaj: You know, we\u2019re not that far from Vazquez Rocks.\nSheldon: Oh, they shot a lot of Star Trek episodes out there.\nHoward: We\u2019ve got our costumes in the trunk. We could go there and have a little photo shoot.\nRaj: Great idea. I haven\u2019t had a carbohydrate in two weeks. These cheekbones need to be in front of a camera before I eat a pretzel and they\u2019re gone.\nLeonard: Yeah, that sounds fun.\nSheldon: Oh, smashing. Now, Leonard, do you know how to get there?\nLeonard: No.\nSheldon: Yeah, well luckily, someone in the car does.\nGPS: Recalculating. While we\u2019re waiting, do you know which president signed the Intestate Highway System Act into law? The answer, coming up in 14 miles.\nSheldon: None of you will get it. It\u2019s Eisenhower.\nScene: The comic book store.\nBernadette: Why are they staring?\nAmy: Who cares? Just soak it in. Hello, boys.\nStuart: Oh, hey. Could you please stop staring? They\u2019re just girls. It\u2019s nothing you haven\u2019t seen in movies or in drawings.\nPenny: Hey, Stuart.\nStuart: What brings you guys here?\nBernadette: We were looking for a recommendation about comic books.\nStuart: Oh, well, I recommend you don\u2019t open a store and sell them.\nPenny: No, we were just wondering why the guys like this stuff so much, so we thought we\u2019d give it a try.\nStuart: Oh, okay. What do you think you might be into? Superhero, fantasy, graphic novels, manga\u2026 I swear I will turn a hose on you.\nBernadette: What kind of comics do the guys like?\nStuart: Um, a little bit of everything. Mostly superhero stuff.\nAmy: All right, well, who\u2019s the best superhero?\nStuart: Shh! You can\u2019t ask a question like that in here. Are you trying to start a rumble?\nPenny: Well then, what do you recommend?\nStuart: Well, uh, let\u2019s see. You\u2019ve got your basic clean-cut good guys, Superman, Spider-Man, Captain America. Then you have your darker anti-heroes, your Batman, your Wolverine, Punisher.\nAmy: Ooh, I do love a bad boy.\nPenny: As evidenced by your boyfriend and his fear of hamsters.\nStuart: If I were you, I\u2019d go for Fables number one. The artwork is sophisticated, it\u2019s intelligently written, and it doesn\u2019t objectify or stereotype women.\nPenny: Ooh, Thor! He\u2019s hot.\nStuart: Yeah, he kind of is.\nScene: Vasquez Rocks. Sheldon, dressed as Data, is having his makeup put on by Raj, dressed as Worf.\nRaj: And we\u2019re blending, and we\u2019re blending, and we\u2019re done.\nSheldon: I know Mr. Data isn\u2019t supposed to smile, but here it comes.\nHoward (dressed as a Borg): Come on, guys. Let\u2019s do this.\nLeonard (dressed as Captain Picard): Yeah, I\u2019m sweating my bald cap off.\nHoward: So what\u2019s our first pose going to be?\nRaj: I say we begin with a classic Star Trek fight scene.\nLeonard: I\u2019ll set the timer.\nHoward: Sheldon, how is that a fight pose?\nSheldon: Mr. Data\u2019s weapon is his mind. I\u2019m wielding it.\nRaj: Phasers on the Borg! Charlie\u2019s Angels.\nHoward: Okay, what\u2019s next?\nRaj: Now let\u2019s do some sexy glamour shots. I\u2019ll set the mood. (Rhythmically) Oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, Yeah, nice one, oontz, oontz. That\u2019s right. Oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz\u2026\nHoward: Oh, my God. Leonard, someone\u2019s stealing your car!\nLeonard: What? Hey, hey! Come back here!\nRaj: Stop!\nSheldon: Stealing is against the law!\nLeonard: I don\u2019t believe this.\nHoward: Son of a bitch.\nRaj: I\u2019ll call 911. What, oh, no, my phone is in my other pants.\nHoward: Oh, so is mine.\nLeonard: Mine, too. Anybody got any ideas?\nSheldon: Nope. The only thing left to do now is assign blame. (To Raj) Nice going.\nScene: The side of the road.\nLeonard: What kind of a person steals another person\u2019s car in broad daylight?\nSheldon: What kind of person leaves his keys in the car?\nLeonard: I thought we agreed this was all Koothrappali\u2019s fault.\nSheldon: You\u2019re right. Nice going.\nHoward: Car.\nRaj: What is wrong with people? Why don\u2019t they stop?\nSheldon: Maybe we\u2019re better off. What if we were to get in a car with a crazy person?\nLeonard: Look at us, Sheldon. We\u2019re the crazy people.\nSheldon: Well, perhaps we should hold up a sign that assures passing motorists of our mental competence.\nHoward: Good idea. Why don\u2019t you get started on that?\nLeonard: Come on, let\u2019s just start walking. There\u2019s got to be a gas station or something nearby.\nSheldon: What, you think just because you\u2019re wearing a captain\u2019s uniform, you\u2019re in charge?\nLeonard: Yes.\nSheldon: All right.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment.\nPenny: Hmm, okay, I\u2019m done. How did you guys finish so fast?\nBernadette: I don\u2019t know, there were a lot of pictures, and one page only had the word brakkadoom!\nPenny: Yeah, well, I have street smarts.\nBernadette: So, what\u2019d you guys think?\nAmy: Well, there was a lot of action.\nPenny: Mmm.\nAmy: And the story moved along at a brisk pace. It was, overall, what\u2019s the word I\u2019m looking for?\nPenny: Stupid?\nAmy: So stupid.\nPenny: I don\u2019t know how Leonard can get so caught up in this.\nBernadette: It\u2019s crazy, they spend hours arguing about things that don\u2019t even exist.\nAmy: What a waste of time.\nPenny: I know. A hammer so heavy that no one else can pick it up?\nBernadette: I don\u2019t think it\u2019s heavy. It\u2019s some sort of magic, so only Thor can lift it.\nPenny: That makes even less sense, I mean\u2026\nAmy: No, no, no, it doesn\u2019t. Thor is a god. The hammer is his, only he can use it. It\u2019s like Sheldon and his toothbrush. Or his thin, beckoning lips.\nPenny: Okay, hang on, what if Thor\u2019s hand is on the hammer? I mean, if he\u2019s touching it with his god magic, does that mean I could lift it?\nBernadette: No.\nAmy: Yes.\nPenny: Well, which is it?\nAmy: Maybe we missed something.\nBernadette: Let\u2019s read it again.\nPenny: Okay.\nAmy: Yeah.\nBernadette: You want some tea?\nAmy: Good idea. I\u2019ll help you.\nPenny: Wait, I thought we were reading.\nAmy: We are. We\u2019re just, uh, giving you a head start.\nScene: The desert.\nHoward: I wish my mom was here. We could all hang out in her shadow.\nRaj: Wool pants in the desert. I feel like I\u2019ve got poached testicles.\nLeonard: Oh, you poor thing, you\u2019re sweating. That\u2019s so much worse than having your car stolen.\nRaj: Insurance is gonna buy you a new car. It\u2019s not gonna de-funk my junk.\nSheldon: Gentlemen, a little less bellyaching. We\u2019re Starfleet officers and a member of the Borg Collective.\nLeonard: Please, Sheldon, I am so not in the mood.\nSheldon: Leonard, all our lives we have dreamed of finding ourselves inside one of the fantasy worlds we love. And look at us. At this moment, we are, in fact, a Star Trek landing party stranded in an alien and unforgiving environment, relying only on our wits, our fortitude and our moxie. As long as we have those things, nothing can stop\u2026\nGuys in Passing Car (throwing a drink over Sheldon): Nerds!\nSheldon: I hate this planet.\nScene: Penny\u2019s Apartment.\nAmy: It says right here on the hammer, whoever holds this hammer, if he be worthy, shall possess the power of Thor.\nBernadette: Hold on, who decides who\u2019s worthy? Does the hammer decide?\nPenny: Yes!\nAmy: No! It can\u2019t decide. It\u2019s a hammer.\nPenny: You said it\u2019s a magic hammer.\nAmy: Yeah, but, it can\u2019t make decisions.\nPenny: If Harry Potter\u2019s wand can make decisions, why can\u2019t Thor\u2019s hammer?\nAmy: Okay, if you\u2019re going to start comparing wands and hammers, I can\u2019t even take you seriously.\nScene: A diner.\nSheldon: Hello. Hello. Uh, uh, uh, four glasses of water, please. Anything for you guys?\nLeonard: Can I use your phone? Our car got stolen.\nWaitress: Why don\u2019t you ask Scotty to beam you up?\nSheldon: Scotty was on the original series, and we\u2019re Next Generation. So, joke\u2019s on you.\nHoward: We\u2019re not with him.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment.\nAmy: You can\u2019t pick something up in outer space. In space, there is no up.\nPenny: Oh, yeah? Then how does the sun come up every day?\nAmy: Hard to argue with those kind of street smarts.\nBernadette: Leonard and Sheldon have boxes of comics across the hall. Why don\u2019t we go look at those?\nPenny: Oh, great. Yes. And then you will see, I am not wrong, because if we were in outer space, then anyone could pick up the hammer because it would be floating around in a weightless environment. Yeah, that\u2019s right, the slow reader used science. Suck on that.\nScene: The diner.\nPoliceman: Was there anything valuable in the car?\nLeonard: Our clothes, our wallets, phones.\nRaj: And about three hundred dollars worth of makeup, so this thief could look like anyone right now.\nPoliceman: Makeup? Sure.\nLeonard: Uh, we\u2019re going to the Comic-Con in Bakersfield. They have a big costume contest. It\u2019s cooler than it sounds.\nPoliceman: I don\u2019t know, sounds pretty cool.\nRaj: It, it is. It\u2019s not just comic books. They\u2019ve got action figures, toys, a Tron-themed dance party.\nLeonard: Okay, he gets how cool it is.\nPoliceman: I think I have all I need here. You guys need me to call someone? I\u2019m guessing your moms?\nLeonard: Thanks, but we\u2019ve got it covered.\nHoward: Okay, I just talked to my mom. She arranged for us to get a rental car.\nRaj: Great. We can still make it to Comic-Con.\nLeonard: Are you kidding me? After all we\u2019ve been through, I just want to go home.\nRaj: Don\u2019t be like that. Come on, Howard, talk to him.\nHoward: I\u2019m with Leonard. I\u2019m done.\nRaj: Fine, then I guess it\u2019s two against two. How do we decide?\nSheldon: Actually, it\u2019s three against one.\nRaj: What? What about the mission? You said we were a real-life landing party.\nSheldon: Yeah, well, we\u2019re not. We\u2019re an imaginary landing party who had real-life garbage thrown at us by real-life strangers who think we\u2019re idiots. And to tell you the truth, I\u2019m starting to feel like one. I want to go home now.\nRaj: Okay. Did we at least rent the car from Enterprise? Get it? Enterprise? Screw you. That\u2019s funny.\nScene: The apartment.\nBernadette: Well, what if the Hulk picked up Thor while Thor is holding the hammer?\nAmy: Yeah?\nBernadette: Then by the transitive property of picking things up, Hulk picked up the hammer.\nAmy: No. Hulk picked up Thor, Thor picked up the hammer.\nPenny: Okay, hang on. If I go to a bar and pick up a guy, and he picks up a girl, and then we all leave together, did I pick up the girl?\nAmy: Did that ever happen?\nPenny: Hey, are we talking about me or are we talking about Thor?\nScene: The stairwell.\nSheldon: Well, I say that\u2019s the last time we ever go outside.\nAmy (off): Look, right here. Red Hulk is picking up Thor\u2019s hammer \u2019cause Thor\u2019s touching it.\nPenny (off): No, it\u2019s because they\u2019re in space. He\u2019s really just touching the strap.\nAmy(off): The strap is part of the hammer.\nBernadette (off): No, it\u2019s not!\nRaj: Are they actually arguing about comic books?\nLeonard: No, that can\u2019t be right.\nHoward: Maybe Thor\u2019s Hammer is a new colour of nail polish.\nBernadette (off): Then Red Hulk must be worthy.\nPenny (off): How could Red Hulk be worthy?\nBernadette (off): You don\u2019t know his life.\nSheldon: There\u2019s only one logical explanation. Somewhere in the desert we crossed into an alternate dimension where the women in our lives can finally appreciate great literature.\nRaj: If it\u2019s an alternate dimension, sounds like a job for a landing party.\nSheldon: Captain, what are your orders?\nLeonard: I say we investigate.\nSheldon: Wait. They might be hostile.\nLeonard: Fine, but set them to stun. If we vaporize Penny, I\u2019ll never find a girlfriend that pretty again.\nScene: Leonard\u2019s car.\nGPS: Fun fact, President Eisenhower signed the Federal Aid Highway Act from his hospital room.\nFirst Car Thief: Wow, that is interesting.\nSecond Car Thief: You learn something new every day.\nGPS: Say, can you name the four state capitols that are not served by the interstate system?\nFirst Car Thief: Ooh, another quiz.\nSecond Car Thief: Yes!\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "7_18": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The apartment.\nAmy: Should you really be sitting in Sheldon\u2019s spot?\nRaj: He\u2019s in Texas, he\u2019ll never know.\nPenny: I wouldn\u2019t be so sure about that.\nLeonard: Yeah, he has a very sensitive butt. Well, it\u2019s true. Once I saw him sit on a bunch of loose change and add it up.\nRaj: Have you heard from Howard?\nBernadette: I did. His talk at NASA went great.\nPenny: Sheldon didn\u2019t heckle him?\nBernadette: No, in fact, he was so well-behaved, Howie bought him a Buzz Aldrin bobble head and astronaut ice cream.\nStuart: Hey, guys.\nAmy: Oh, hi.\nBernadette: Hi, Stuart.\nRaj: Hey, Stuart!\nStuart: How\u2019s it going?\nRaj: Good. Sheldon\u2019s out of town, so we can do whatever we want. We even ordered from the Thai place he doesn\u2019t like.\nStuart: Oh, how is it?\nPenny: Disgusting. Do not tell him.\nLeonard: What do you guys want to do tonight?\nAmy: I don\u2019t know.\nBernadette: Well, I told Howie if I wasn\u2019t busy, I\u2019d spend the night at his mom\u2019s. So for God\u2019s sake, think of something.\nRaj: Stuart? Are you okay?\nStuart: No, I don\u2019t feel so\u2026\nLeonard: Oh, my God, Stuart?\nPenny: Oh, my God, you guys need to do something!\nRaj: Stuart?\nLeonard: Calling 911.\nRaj: Well, it\u2019s too late.\nLeonard: What do you mean it\u2019s too late?\nRaj: He\u2019s been murdered by someone in this room.\nPenny: Oh, my God.\nLeonard: Oh, come on.\nRaj: Welcome to another classic Koothrappali murder mystery dinner.\nAmy: I\u2019m leaving.\nRaj: You can\u2019t leave. You\u2019re a suspect in the mysterious murder of Stuart Bloom.\nBernadette: I didn\u2019t know his last name was Bloom.\nAmy: Yeah, it\u2019s Bloom.\nPenny: Are you really gonna lie on the floor and pretend to be dead all night?\nStuart: What do you think I was gonna do at home?\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The apartment.\nPenny: Are you gonna make us pretend to be a bunch of lame characters with silly accents?\nRaj: Lame characters with silly ac\u2026, what kind of actress are you?\nPenny: You\u2019re right, I\u2019m sorry. Sounds like fun.\nRaj: Thank you.\nPenny: That kind of actress. This sucks.\nLeonard: Come on, guys. Raj put a lot of effort into this. And that\u2019s great. It\u2019s not sad, it\u2019s great.\nAmy: I think it might be fun to be someone else tonight.\nRaj: Actually, you\u2019re all just gonna be yourselves.\nAmy: Oh, ugh.\nBernadette: All right, if I\u2019m doing this, I\u2019m playing to win, so just to be clear, if we\u2019re ourselves, that means one of us killed Stuart?\nRaj: Very good, Bernadette. You are a regular Byomkesh Bakshi.\nBernadette: What is that, like, the Indian Sherlock Holmes?\nRaj: Or is Sherlock Holmes the English Byomkesh Bakshi?\nAmy: According to Wikipedia, Sherlock Holmes came first.\nRaj: Great, everyone\u2019s a Byomkesh Bakshi. Now, here are some secret facts about each of you, including whether you are the murderer. Throughout the game, feel free to ask each other questions to uncover clues.\nPenny: Got it. Hey, who\u2019s the murderer?\nRaj: Any question but that.\nPenny: Sorry. Hey, who\u2019s not the murderer?\nStuart: Bernadette, can you not stand so close to me?\nBernadette: What do you care? You\u2019re dead.\nStuart: Suit yourself. But I can kind of see up your skirt.\nScene: A hire car.\nSheldon: Thank you for my bobble head.\nHoward: Thank you for not making fun of me during my speech.\nSheldon: It wasn\u2019t easy. Was it Buzz?\nHoward: We can\u2019t show up to your mom\u2019s empty-handed. We should bring something.\nSheldon: I already am. I\u2019m bringing the gift of knowledge.\nHoward: Oh, boy.\nSheldon: Despite what her Bible says, recent archaeological studies indicate that although camels are referenced in the Old Testament, they didn\u2019t exist in the Middle East until hundreds of years later.\nHoward: I was gonna say we pick up a cake or a pie. But an insult to her faith is always thoughtful.\nScene: The apartment. \nBernadette: So, what happens next?\nRaj: I can\u2019t tell you that. But perhaps the killer dropped a fun and imaginative clue somewhere in the apartment.\nPenny: Ooh, I\u2019m gonna check the fridge, and see if there are any clues inside a beer.\nAmy: Hey, I found something. It looks like a little man with a briefcase.\nLeonard: Oh, no, no. That\u2019s Clarence Darrow. It\u2019s from a game Sheldon made up called Chutes and Lawyers. You slide down a chute and then work your way back up through the appellate system.\nRaj: Well, unlike that, my games are much more fun.\nPenny: Okay, can I ask you something? Why do you like making us do this stuff?\nRaj: Well, I guess it goes back to when I was a fat kid in India, and didn\u2019t have any friends.\nBernadette: I didn\u2019t know you were fat.\nRaj: Yeah, I was. I was 200 pounds by the time I was in middle school. Kids were mean. Cows may be sacred there, but it doesn\u2019t help if you look like one. Anyway, I was pretty lonely, so I had to make up my own stories and games, and I promised myself if I ever made any friends that, that I would play those games with them.\nAmy: That is so sweet.\nLeonard: I\u2019ve seen old pictures of you. You were never a fat kid.\nRaj: No, I was svelte as a gazelle. A gazelle blessed with a flair for storytelling.\nBernadette: Hey, what about this? It looks like a receipt.\nAmy: What\u2019s it for?\nBernadette: For a cup of coffee. But it\u2019s dated 20 years from now.\nRaj: From the future? How fun and imaginative.\nLeonard: So one of us came back from the future to murder Stuart?\nRaj: Correct.\nLeonard: Does the gazelle with a flair for storytelling know he\u2019s just ripping off Terminator?\nRaj: Does the smart-ass know that Terminator was actually ripped off from an Outer Limits script called Demon With a Glass Hand, by Harlan Ellison?\nLeonard: Oh, does the gazelle know that according to Harlan Ellison, it was not ripped off from Demon With a Glass Hand, but was ripped off from another Outer Limits script he wrote called The Soldier?\nPenny: I\u2019m gonna need another clue.\nScene: Sheldon\u2019s childhood home.\nHoward: Okay, give me the flowers and pie.\nSheldon: But if we show up and you\u2019re holding them, she\u2019ll think they\u2019re only from you.\nHoward: They are only from me. You said the gift of you was enough.\nSheldon: Yes, but now that I\u2019ve seen what the gift of me with flowers and pie looks like, there\u2019s no going back. Boy, I can\u2019t wait to see the look on her face. We\u2019re leaving right now.\nHoward: What\u2019s wrong?\nSheldon: Nothing.\nHoward: What? Sheldon, tell me what\u2019s going on.\nSheldon: I saw my mommy with a naked man and she was trying to be a mommy again.\nScene: A bar in Texas.\nHoward: You ready to talk about it?\nSheldon: I\u2019m not nearly drunk enough. Okay. Do you have any idea what it\u2019s like to see your mother ravaging someone?\nHoward: Does a brisket count? I\u2019m sorry, buddy, that\u2019s rough. But didn\u2019t she know we were coming?\nSheldon: No. I wanted to surprise her. What am I supposed to say to her after something like this?\nHoward: Well, did she see you in the window?\nSheldon: No.\nHoward: Then don\u2019t say anything.\nSheldon: I have to. How can we ever hope to have a healthy relationship if I don\u2019t tell her how disappointed I am, and that I\u2019ll never forgive her?\nHoward: Well, don\u2019t do it on the phone.\nSheldon: No, I\u2019m just going to tell her I\u2019m coming so she can give that good time Charlie the heave-ho.\nHoward: That\u2019s some tough talk, I may need to cut you off.\nSheldon: Yeah, maybe you better, I took a pretty big sip.\nHoward: Look, she\u2019s a grown woman. And, and your dad\u2019s been gone a long time. Maybe this is none of your business.\nSheldon: I beg to differ. I used to live in those genitals. And if someone wants to move into my old room, I should at least get a vote.\nScene: The apartment.\nRaj: Okay, murder suspects, Leonard has found the time machine the killer must\u2019ve used. You\u2019re all inside it, and we hurtle through the very fabric of time. And welcome to 20 years in the future. Hey, you guys just time-travelled. Stop looking so bored.\nPenny: Well, my beer isn\u2019t flat and my rack\u2019s not saggy. So far, the future\u2019s great.\nStuart: Hey, can I go to the bathroom?\nRaj: Fine, just try not to look too alive.\nStuart: That\u2019s my jam.\nBernadette: So one of us went back in time to kill Stuart?\nAmy: But why?\nRaj: Perhaps this will help. Here are some facts about yourselves in the future that might contain a clue.\nAmy: Hey, I won the Nobel Prize in physiology, then I used the money to buy Stuart\u2019s comic book store, and close it down so Sheldon would pay attention to me. Not the worst idea.\nPenny: Hey, I\u2019m a famous actress living in London.\nLeonard: Hmm, I\u2019m a professor at Stanford.\nPenny: Hmm.\nBernadette: So I guess you two are making it work long distance.\nRaj: Oh, no. In this game, as your careers both took off, you drifted apart. Kind of like how future me lost touch with you guys after I became boy toy for the wrinkled, but still flexible, Madonna.\nAmy: What does your card say, Bernadette?\nLeonard: Uh, uh, uh, hang on. Do you think we\u2019d really drift apart if we both became successful?\nPenny: Of course not. If I became a famous actress and had to move, you would just come with me.\nLeonard: But if I get a chance to be a tenured professor, I might not have that much choice in where I end up.\nPenny: Yeah, but if I become a successful actress, we wouldn\u2019t need the money.\nLeonard: Well, you don\u2019t go into science for the money.\nBernadette: Speak for yourself. Last month, my company both invented and cured Restless Eye Syndrome. Ka-ching, ya blinky chumps.\nPenny: So, wait, if my career took me somewhere else, you might not go?\nAmy: Dun, dun, dun. He started it.\nRaj: Okay, okay, guys, new back stories. Uh, Penny and Leonard, you two lovebirds are super successful and living in New York. Uh, you\u2019re an actress, you\u2019re a professor and you have three beautiful kids.\nLeonard: Great.\nPenny: Really? You think I\u2019m putting this body through three kids?\nScene: Sheldon\u2019s childhood home.\nSheldon: Okay, let\u2019s do this.\nHoward: Good luck.\nSheldon: You, aren\u2019t you gonna come with me?\nHoward: While you confront your mother about her sex life? I\u2019d rather go back to that bar in ass-less chaps.\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Mother? (Knock, knock, knock) Mother? (Knock, knock, knock) Mother?\nMrs Cooper: Shelly, I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re here.\nSheldon: I saw you having naked sex.\nMrs Cooper: What are you talking about?\nSheldon: Earlier, I came here to surprise you. I looked in the window and I saw you with a man.\nMrs Cooper: Oh, Shelly, I\u2019m so sorry. Come in. Um, maybe we should sit down and talk about this.\nSheldon: Can you recommend a surface you haven\u2019t had coitus on?\nMrs Cooper: That\u2019s not funny. Maybe we should sit at the table. Well, I\u2019m sure that, uh, you have a lot of questions.\nSheldon: Who was he?\nMrs Cooper: His name is Ron. I met him at my prayer group.\nSheldon: How long have you been involved with him?\nMrs Cooper: A few months.\nSheldon: And of those few months, how long have you been a demented sex pervert?\nMrs Cooper: That is no way to speak to your mother.\nSheldon: Perhaps not. But it is a way to speak to a woman who quoted the Bible to me my whole life, and then desecrates one of Ethan Allen\u2019s finest sofas.\nMrs Cooper: I will give you one opportunity, young man, to apologize.\nSheldon: Or what?\nMrs Cooper: Or I will send you to your room.\nSheldon: That\u2019s ridiculous. I am a grown man. I am a professional scientist. And I currently occupy the moral high ground.\nMrs Cooper: Go to your room.\nSheldon: But I occupy the moral high ground.\nMrs Cooper: Go to your room.\nSheldon: But I\u2019m a professional scientist.\nMrs: Go to your room!\nSheldon: I\u2019m a grown man.\nScene: The apartment.\nRaj: Can we please get back to the game?\nLeonard: In a minute. I don\u2019t understand why any success you have in acting is more important than any I have in science.\nPenny: Okay, if you do something cool in science, you might change the world. If I become a famous actress, I\u2019m not gonna tell you why movie stars are the best. They just are.\nAmy: I\u2019m surprised you guys never talked about this stuff.\nLeonard: Like you and Sheldon have everything figured out?\nAmy: Actually, our relationship agreement covers a wide array of scenarios, including career changes, financial instability, intelligent dog uprising. FYI, we plan on selling out the human race hard.\nPenny: In 20 years, who knows what\u2019ll happen with any of us?\nStuart: I think you and Leonard will be together.\nPenny: You do?\nStuart: Yeah. I think you\u2019re the best couple I know.\nLeonard: Aw.\nPenny: That\u2019s so sweet.\nBernadette: What the hell?\nAmy: Excuse me?\nPenny: Ah-da-da-da-da, let the dead man talk. So, why do you think that?\nStuart: Uh, well, I feel like you guys make each other better. Penny brought Leonard out of his shell. And it seems like Leonard makes Penny think more deeply about the world. I don\u2019t know. Together, you two kind of make one awesome person.\nPenny: Aw, Stuart. Now I feel bad for murdering you.\nRaj: Oh, come on.\nBernadette: Penny did it, I win. Suck it, jackasses.\nScene: Sheldon\u2019s old bedroom.\nHoward: Hey, can I come in?\nSheldon: Apparently any man is welcome in this house. Why not you? I thought you were waiting in the car.\nHoward: That was an hour ago, Sheldon. A Jew sits in front of a house in Texas that long, For Sale signs start to go up. I take it things didn\u2019t go smoothly with your mom.\nSheldon: No. I\u2019m not sure how we\u2019re going to get past this.\nHoward: You know, I, I sort of went through something like this myself.\nSheldon: Howard, we\u2019ve all seen your mother naked. That woman needs to learn how to tie a robe.\nHoward: I\u2019m talking about when my mom started seeing someone a couple of years after my dad left.\nSheldon: I didn\u2019t know she did.\nHoward: Yeah, she was dating this guy, and I was kind of a jerk to her about it.\nSheldon: What did you do?\nHoward: Well, let\u2019s just say it was the most vicious bar mitzvah speech in the history of Temple Beth El. Anyway, she broke up with him. And she\u2019s basically been alone ever since. She never said it, but I always felt I was the reason why.\nSheldon: I\u2019m sorry. Although, based on your story, you absolutely were the reason why.\nHoward: All I\u2019m saying is you might not want to get in the way of your mom\u2019s happiness.\nSheldon: You may have a point. I love my mother. Even if she fornicates like a demonic weasel.\nHoward: And the healing begins.\nScene: Mrs Cooper\u2019s living room.\nSheldon: Hello.\nMrs Cooper: Hello. Are you ready to discuss this calmly, like adults?\nSheldon: I am.\nMrs Cooper: Shelly, I\u2019m sorry that you saw what you saw. I know that this is hard for you.\nSheldon: I think what most upsets me about it, Mother, is the hypocrisy. Doesn\u2019t this contradict all the religious rules you\u2019ve been espousing your whole life?\nMrs Cooper: You\u2019re right, it does, and it\u2019s something that I\u2019m struggling with these days.\nSheldon: Then why are you doing it?\nMrs Cooper: Because I\u2019m not perfect, Shelly. And that man\u2019s booty is.\nSheldon: Well, this is confusing for me. But I don\u2019t want to stand in the way of your happiness. So, I\u2019ll condemn you internally while maintaining an outward appearance of acceptance.\nMrs Cooper: That is very Christian of you.\nSheldon: Mother, if you\u2019re going to conduct your life in this fashion, then I should let you know that the world has changed since you were a young woman. You know, it\u2019s not all sock hops, soda jerks and segregation anymore.\nMrs Cooper: How old do you think I am?\nSheldon: My point is that you\u2019re going to need to be careful. You used to be protected by your pre-Enlightenment mythology, but now you\u2019re going to need a stronger friend named latex.\nMrs Cooper: Are you having the sex talk with me?\nSheldon: Well, someone has to.\nMrs Cooper: Oh, dear Lord.\nSheldon: No, don\u2019t look to Him. He\u2019s mad at you right now.\nScene: The apartment.\nPenny: Oh, come on, don\u2019t pout. I\u2019m sorry I ruined your game.\nRaj: I\u2019m not pouting, I\u2019m brooding. Which is how sexy men pout.\nAmy: It actually was kind of fun.\nRaj: You\u2019re just saying that.\nAmy: Yeah.\nBernadette: I liked the time travel element.\nRaj: Thank you. I thought it was inspired.\nLeonard: It was. By Terminator.\nBernadette: Well, I hope 20 years from now, we really are all still together and still friends.\nPenny: Definitely.\nLeonard: Of course. Well, hey, how about this? Whether we\u2019re friends, not friends, scattered around the world, no matter what, let\u2019s all promise to meet in front of this building exactly 20 years from tonight at 8:00 p.m. and have dinner like we always do.\nBernadette: Aw.\nPenny: I love it.\nLeonard: Putting it in my phone right now.\nPenny: Yeah, me, too.\nStuart: My phone doesn\u2019t have a calendar. So I\u2019ll just write it on my hand.\nRaj: And it\u2019s done.\nPenny: Yup, we\u2019re all in.\nLeonard: All right, I\u2019ll see you guys in 20 years.\nScene: In front of the building, 20 years later.\nStuart: I knew it.\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "1_9": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The apartment, Leonard is attaching something to a lamp.\nLeonard: Okay, the X10s are online.\nHoward: Gentlemen, I am now about to send a signal from this laptop through our local ISP, racing down fibre-optic cable at the speed of light to San Francisco, bouncing off a satellite in geosynchronous orbit to Lisbon, Portugal, where the data packets will be handed off to submerged transatlantic cables terminating in Halifax, Nova-Scotia, and transferred across the continent via microwave relays back to our ISP and the X10 receiver attached to this (clicks mouse, lamp switches on) lamp. (The others cheer and clap). \nSheldon: Look at me, look at me, I\u2019ve got goosebumps. \nHoward: Are we ready on the stereo? \nRaj: Go for stereo. \n(Howard clicks mouse again. Also Sprach Zarathustra begins to play. At the climactic notes, the four jump in the air and begin pretend conducting or jumping about in time to the music.)\nPenny (entering): Hey guys. \nAll (calming down, embarrassed): Hello.\nPenny: It\u2019s a little loud.\nHoward: No problem, turning it down. (Using mouse again) San Francisco, Lisbon, Halifax (the music gets quieter) et voila. \nPenny: Okay, thanks.\nLeonard: Hang on, hang on, do you not realise what we just did.\nPenny: Yeah, you turned your stereo down with your laptop. \nSheldon: No, we turned our stereo down by sending a signal around the world via the internet. \nPenny: Oh. You know you can just get one of those universal remotes at Radio Shack, they\u2019re really cheap.\nLeonard: No, no, no, you don\u2019t get it, um, Howard, enable public access. \nHoward: Public access enabled. (They all stare around for a moment in silence.)\nPenny: Boy, that\u2019s brilliant, but I\u2019ll see you.\nLeonard: No, hang on, hang on. (The lamp goes off and on again.) See! \nPenny: No.\nSheldon: Someone in Sezchuan province, China is using his computer to turn our lights on and off. \nPenny: Huh, well that\u2019s handy. Um, here\u2019s a question, why? \nAll together: Because we can. (There is a loud noise)\nSheldon: They found the remote controlled cars.\nPenny: Well, wait, wait, what\u2019s on top of them. \nLeonard: Wireless webcams, wave hello. \nHoward: The monster truck is out of Austin, Texas, and the blue Viper is being operated from suburban Tel Aviv. \nSheldon: You may want to put on slacks. \nPenny: What? (Seeing red car is trying to get between her legs) Ew, stop it, no, leave me alone. \nLeonard: Who\u2019s running the red Corvette?\nHoward: That would be me. \nCredits sequence\nScene: The same, clearing up.\nSheldon: You know, in the future, when we\u2019re disembodied brains in jars, we\u2019re going to look back on this as eight hours well wasted. \nRaj: I don\u2019t want to be in a jar. I want my brain in an android body. Eight feet tall and ripped. \nHoward: I\u2019m with you. I just have to make sure if I\u2019m a synthetic human I\u2019d still be Jewish. I promised my mother. \nRaj: I suppose you could have your android penis circumcised. But that\u2019s something your Rabbi would have to discuss with the manufacturers. \nSheldon: Not to mention you\u2019d have to power down on Saturdays. \nLeonard: Sheldon, why is this letter in the trash? \nSheldon: Well, there\u2019s always the possibility that a trash can spontaneously formed around the letter, but Occam\u2019s Razor would suggest that someone threw it out. \nLeonard: It\u2019s from the Institute for Experimental Physics. They want us to present our paper on the properties of super solids at the topical conference on Bowes-Einstein condensates. \nSheldon: I know. I read it before I threw it out. \nLeonard: Okay\u2026 if I may drill down to the bedrock of my question, why did you throw it out.\nSheldon: Because I have no interest in standing in the Rose Room of the Pasadena Marriott in front of a group of judgemental strangers, who wouldn\u2019t recognise true genius if it were standing in front of them giving a speech. Which, if I were there, it would be. \nHoward: I don\u2019t know, Sheldon, those topical conferences on Bowes-Einstein condensates parties are legendary. \nLeonard: Forget the parties.\nHoward: Forget the parties? What a nerd. \nLeonard: Are there any other honours I\u2019ve gotten that I don\u2019t know about? Did UPS drop off a Nobel Prize with my name on it?\nSheldon: Leonard, please don\u2019t take this the wrong way, but the day you win a Nobel Prize, is the day I begin my research on the drag co-efficient of tassles on flying carpets. \nRaj: Hoo-hoo-hoo. The only thing missing from that insult was \u201cyo mamma.\u201d \nHoward: I\u2019ve got one, hey Leonard, your mamma\u2019s research methodology is so flawed\u2026.\nLeonard: Shut up, Howard. Sheldon, we have to do this.\nSheldon: No we don\u2019t. We have to take in nourishment, expel waste, and inhale enough oxygen to keep ourselves from dying, everything else is optional. \nLeonard: Okay, let me put it this way, I\u2019m doing it.\nSheldon: You can\u2019t. I\u2019m the lead author. \nLeonard: Oh, come on. The only reason you\u2019re the lead author is because we went alphabetically. \nSheldon: I let you think we went alphabetically to spare you the humiliation of dealing with the fact that it was my idea. Not to put too fine a point on it, but I was throwing you a bone. You\u2019re welcome. \nLeonard: Excuse me, I designed the experiment that proved the hypothesis. \nSheldon: It doesn\u2019t need proving. \nLeonard: So the entire scientific community is just supposed to take your word?\nSheldon: They\u2019re not supposed to, but they should. \nLeonard: Alright, I don\u2019t care what you say, I\u2019m going to the conference and I\u2019m presenting our findings. \nSheldon: And I forbid it. \nLeonard: You forbid it?\nSheldon: If I\u2019m not taking credit for our work then nobody is. \nLeonard: Oh, you admit that it\u2019s our work.\nSheldon: No, once again, I\u2019m throwing you a bone. And once again, you are welcome. \nLeonard: Ah!\nHoward: Oh no he dit\u2019nt!\nScene: Leonard\u2019s bedroom. Penny is looking through his closet. \nPenny: So, how\u2019s it going with Sheldon, are you guys still not talking to each other? \nLeonard: Not only is he still not talking to me, but there\u2019s this thing he does where he stares at you and tries to get your brain to explode. You know, like in the classic sci-fi movie Scanners? (Put\u2019s fingers to head) You know, bzzz-pchew! Never mind. How about this one. It says, \u201cI know my physics, but I\u2019m still a fun guy!\u201d\nPenny: Oh, hey, I didn\u2019t know they still made corduroy suits!\nLeonard: They don\u2019t, that\u2019s why I saved this one. \nPenny: Okay, well, let\u2019s just see what else you have. Okay, here, take this, and this, and this, and these.\nLeonard: Is this all stuff you want me to try on?\nPenny: No, this is stuff I want you to throw out. \nLeonard: Oh.\nPenny: Seriously, don\u2019t even give it to charity, you won\u2019t be helping anyone. What\u2019s this.\nLeonard: Oh, that\u2019s the bottled city of Kandor. \nPenny: Uh-huh. \nLeonard: You see, Kandor was the capital city of the planet Krypton, it was miniaturised by Brainiac before Krypton exploded and then rescued by Superman. \nPenny: Oh, nice. \nLeonard: It\u2019s a lot cooler when girls aren\u2019t looking at it.\nPenny: Here, why don\u2019t you put these on while I find a shirt and sport-coat to match. \nLeonard: Great, be right back.\nPenny: Well, where you going, just put them on. \nLeonard: Here?\nPenny: Oh, are you shy? \nLeonard: No, I\u2019m not shy.\nPenny: Don\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t look. \nLeonard: I know you won\u2019t look, why would you look, there\u2019s nothing to see, well, not nothing\u2026.\nPenny: Sweetie, put the pants on.\nLeonard: Putting them on.\nPenny: So, you know, isn\u2019t there maybe some way you and Sheldon could compromise on this whole presentation thing.\nLeonard: No. No. Scientists do not compromise. Our minds are trained to synthesise facts and come to inarguable conclusions. Not to mention, Sheldon is batcrap crazy. \nPenny: What is this?\nLeonard: Oh, careful. That\u2019s my original series Battlestar Galactica flight suit. \nPenny: Oh, why didn\u2019t you wear it at Halloween?\nLeonard: Because it\u2019s not a costume, it\u2019s a flight suit. \nPenny: Okay, alright, moving on, oh, wow, a paisley shirt.\nLeonard: Uh-huh, it goes with my corduroy suit. \nPenny: If you mean it should end up in the same place then, I agree. Is this your\u2026 your only tie?\nLeonard: Ah. Technically yes, but, if you\u2019ll notice, it\u2019s reversible. So it works as two. \nPenny: Oh, sweetie, I don\u2019t think it even works as one. Is this all your clothes?\nLeonard: Yeah. Everything since the eighth grade. \nPenny: The\u2026 the eighth grade?\nLeonard: My last growth spurt. \nPenny: Okay, well, I guess we\u2019re back to the corduroy suit. \nLeonard: Great.\nPenny: Yup. (Leonard picks up paisley shirt) I said no, put it down. \nScene: The ground floor hallway.\nPenny: Hey Sheldon! \nSheldon (unlocking his mailbox): Hello Penny. \u00a0\nPenny: Get anything good? \nSheldon: Uh, just the latest copy of Applied Particle Physics Quarterly.\nPenny: Oh, you know, that is so weird that yours came and mine didn\u2019t. (Sheldon looks confused). It was a joke. (Sheldon gives a fake laugh.) Yup, tip your waitresses, I\u2019m here all week. \nSheldon: Penny, just to save you from further awkwardness know that I\u2019m perfectly comfortable with the two of us climbing the stairs in silence. \nPenny: Oh yeah, me too. Zip it, lock it. (The begin to climb) Put it in your pocket. So you and Leonard\u2026\nSheldon: Oh dear God! \nPenny: Little misunderstanding, huh. \nSheldon: A little misunder\u2026. Galileo and the Pope had a little misunderstanding.\nPenny: Anyway, I was talking to Leonard this morning and I think he feels really bad about it. \nSheldon: Huh.\nPenny: Well how do you feel?\nSheldon: I don\u2019t understand the question.\nPenny: Well I\u2019m just asking if it\u2019s difficult to be fighting with your best friend. \nSheldon: Oh. I hadn\u2019t thought about it like that. I wonder if I\u2019ve been experiencing physiological manifestations of some sort of unconscious emotional turmoil. \nPenny: Wait\u2026 what? \nSheldon: I couldn\u2019t poop this morning. \nPenny: You should just talk to him, I\u2019m sure you guys can work this out. \nSheldon: It\u2019s certainly preferable to my plan.\nPenny: Which was? \nSheldon: A powerful laxative. \nPenny: Okay, so you absolutely should talk to him, look, I know Leonard values you as a friend, and he told me himself that without your little idea there\u2019s no way he could have come up with this whole experiment thing.\nSheldon: Excuse me, little idea? \nPenny: Yeah, I mean he tried to explain it to me, I didn\u2019t really understand it but\u2026\nSheldon: Of course you didn\u2019t, he said little idea? \nPenny: Uh, well no, no, not in\u2026 not in those words.\nSheldon: In what words then, exactly\nPenny: Um, gee, the exact words aren\u2019t written\u2026 it\u2019s more the spirit in which it\u2019s \nSheldon: What did he say?\nPenny: You had a lucky hunch. \nLeonard (coming out of apartment): Hey, Sheldon, I\u2019ve been thinking, instead of arguing about this why don\u2019t\u2026.\nSheldon: Don\u2019t you ever speak to me again. \nLeonard: What\u2026 (Sheldon goes into apartment and slams the door). \nPenny: Uh, he\u2026 (makes \u201che\u2019s screwy\u201d hand movements, turns to go). \nScene: The apartment. Leonard is dressed in the corduroy suit. \nLeonard: Okay, I\u2019m leaving for the conference. \nSheldon: Have fun presenting my lucky hunch. \nLeonard: Sheldon I didn\u2019t mean it like that.\nSheldon: Then why did you say it.\nLeonard: I don\u2019t know, I wasn\u2019t choosing my\u2026\nSheldon: Were you trying to impress Penny?\nLeonard: No, no not at all. A little bit. \nSheldon: How\u2019d that work out for you?\nPenny (entering): Leonard, ready to go?\nSheldon: Libido 1, truth zero. \nLeonard: Okay, I\u2019m going to ask you one more time, we did the work together, lets present the paper together.\nSheldon: And I\u2019m telling you for the last time it\u2019s pandering, it\u2019s undignified and bite me. \nLeonard: Let\u2019s go.\nPenny: Bye Sheldon. \nSheldon: Goodbye Penny. (Places fingers to head to try to make Leonard\u2019s brain explode. Leonard leaves.) Oooh, one of these days, Pkshhhh!\nScene: A corridor at the conference. Penny is attaching Leonard\u2019s name tag. \nPenny: There you go. \nLeonard: You\u2019re right, this side does look better. \nPenny: No, no, I didn\u2019t say better, I said less stained. \nHoward: I just checked the house, there\u2019s probably twenty, twenty-five people in there.\nLeonard: You\u2019re kidding. \nPenny: Is that all?\nLeonard: All? In particle physics, twenty five is Woodstock. \nPenny: Oh, well, then good!\nLeonard: I wasn\u2019t expecting such a crowd, I\u2019m a little nervous. \nHoward: It\u2019s okay, just open with a joke, you\u2019ll be fine. \nLeonard: A joke. Okay. How about this, um, okay, uh there\u2019s this farmer, and he has these chickens, but they won\u2019t lay any eggs. So, he calls a physicist to help. The physicist then does some calculations, and he says, um, I have a solution, but it only works with spherical chickens in a vacuum. (Raj and Howard laugh.) Right? \nPenny: Oh, sorry, I\u2019ve just, I\u2019ve heard it before. \nHoward: Let\u2019s roll. Hey, nice suit.\nLeonard: It\u2019s a classic, right? \nPenny: I really should have brought my own car. \nScene: Leonard is presenting.\nLeonard: So, in conclusion, the data show that at temperatures approaching absolute zero, the moment of inertia changes, and the solid becomes a super-solid, which clearly appears to be a previously unknown state of matter. (Applause) Thank you. (Penny is asleep on Howard\u2019s shoulder. Howard is taking a photograph with his camera phone.) Are there any questions?\nVoice: Yeah. What the hell was that? \nLeonard: Any other questions?\nSheldon (who previously spoke, now removing his hood and dark glasses): Doctor Sheldon Cooper here, I am the lead author of this particular paper. (No reaction.) Thank you. And you, sir, you have completely skipped over the part where I was walking through the park, and I saw these children on a merry-go-round, which started me thinking about the moment of inertia in gasses like helium at temperatures approaching absolute zero. \nLeonard: I didn\u2019t skip it, it\u2019s just an anecdote. It\u2019s not science.\nSheldon: Oh, I see, was the apple falling on Newton\u2019s head, was that just an anecdote?\nLeonard: You are not Isaac Newton.\nSheldon: No, no that\u2019s true, gravity would have been apparent to me without the apple. \nLeonard: You cannot possibly be that arrogant.\nSheldon: You continue to underestimate me, my good man. \nLeonard: Look, if you weren\u2019t happy with my presentation then maybe you should have given it with me.\nSheldon: As I have explained repeatedly, unlike you, I don\u2019t need validation from lesser minds. No offence. \nLeonard: Really, so why did you come?\nSheldon: Because I knew you\u2019d screw this up.\nLeonard: I didn\u2019t screw it up.\nSheldon: Oh, please. I admit, that spherical chicken joke, that was hilarious. But it was straight downhill from there. \nLeonard: I\u2019ve had enough of your condescension. Maybe I didn\u2019t go to college when I was eleven like you, maybe I got my doctorate at 24 instead of 16, but you are not the only person who is smarter than everyone else in this room. No offense. And I am clearly not the only person who is tormented by insecurity and has an ego in need of constant validation.\nSheldon: So you admit that you\u2019re an egotist?\nLeonard: Yes. (To audience) My name is Dr Leonard Hofstadter, and I could never please my parents so I need to get all my self-esteem from strangers like you. But he\u2019s worse.\nSheldon: Okay, that is it. (Tries to explode brain again.)\nLeonard: You cannot blow up my head with your mind. \nSheldon: Then I\u2019ll settle for an aneurysm. \nLeonard (knocking his hands down): Stop it.\nSheldon: You hit me. You saw him, he hit me.\nLeonard: You were trying to blow up my head.\nSheldon: So it was working.\nLeonard: It wasn\u2019t, it was not, you are a nutcase.\nSheldon: Oh we\u2019ll see about that (tries again), heads up you people in the front row, this is a splash zone.\nLeonard: Stop, stop it, quit it. (The start to fight.)\nPenny: Is this usually how these physics things go?\nHoward: More often than you\u2019d think.\nLeonard (getting Sheldon on floor): Vulcan nerve pinch!\nScene: The apartment. \nSheldon: You could have offered me a ride home. \nLeonard: You\u2019re lucky I didn\u2019t run you over. \nSheldon: I really don\u2019t understand what you\u2019re so unhappy about, you begged me to come, I came, there\u2019s just no pleasing you. \nLeonard: You\u2019re right, I\u2019m the problem, I\u2019m the one that needs help. \nSheldon: Well that\u2019s not much of an apology, but I\u2019ll take it. \nLeonard: Excuse me. Is there anything you\u2019d like to apologise for?\nSheldon: Yes. I\u2019m sorry I tried to blow up your head. It was uncalled for. \nHoward (entering with Raj): You won\u2019t believe this.\nRaj: Somebody got the whole thing on a cell phone and put it on youtube. \nLeonard: What? \nSheldon: Now, who would do that?\nHoward: That would be me. Hey, check it out, it\u2019s a featured video. (The watch). \nLeonard: Oh jeez. Is this suit really look that bad?\nSheldon: Forget your suit, look at my arms waving, I\u2019m like a flamingo on Ritalin. \nPenny (entering): Howard, would you like to explain to me why your facebook page has a picture of me sleeping on your shoulder captioned \u201cMe and my Girlfriend?\u201d\nHoward: Uh-oh, here comes \u201cthe talk.\u201d \nPenny tries to make Howard\u2019s brain explode. \nScene: Captioned \u201cSomewhere in China\u201d, two Chinese students watch the video on their computer. \nStudent one (in captions): What losers. \nStudent two: Yeah. Gigantic American geeks. (The lights flicker)\nStudent one:\u00a0 Who\u2019s doing that? \nStudent two: Someone from Pasadena, California named\u2026 \u201cWolowizard.\u201d \nTogether: Awesome!\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "5_2": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The apartment. Leonard is laying out wine and napkins in front of his laptop.\nSheldon: What are you doing?\nLeonard: Oh, uh, Priya\u2019s calling in a few minutes on Skype, and we are gonna have a dinner date.\nSheldon: It\u2019s eight o\u2019clock in the morning in Mumbai. How can she have dinner?\nLeonard: Fine, whatever. Priya will be having breakfast.\nSheldon: All right, so technically it\u2019s not a dinner date. I suppose you could call it a, uh, dinfast date. But if you did, you\u2019d open yourself to peer-based mocking, such as, Hey, Leonard, how was your dinfast with Priya last night?\nLeonard: That doesn\u2019t sound like mocking.\nSheldon: You didn\u2019t let me finish. Dinfast (rolls eyes). Are those soy-based candles?\nLeonard: I don\u2019t know. Why?\nSheldon: Paraffin candles may contain carcinogens. Unless lung cancer is the ambiance you were going for at your dinfast. Dinfast (rolls eyes).\nLeonard: Listen, I don\u2019t want to be rude, but Priya\u2019s gonna be calling any minute, so\u2026\nSheldon: Oh, yes, Priya. Leonard, you know I make a point of never interfering in your personal affairs.\nLeonard: Yes, I\u2019ve always admired that about you.\nSheldon: As well you should. But I\u2019m going to make an exception here.\nLeonard: Oh, good.\nSheldon: Priya has moved back to India to pursue her law career. Instead of desperately trying to keep this intercontinental relationship alive, you could use that time to take up a hobby.\nLeonard: A hobby?\nSheldon: Yes. I read recently about a fellow in Kansas with an enormous ball of twine. I bet you could give him a run for his money.\nLeonard: You know, some people might say that it\u2019s great that we\u2019re trying to make things work long distance. They\u2019d say things like, love is stronger than the miles between you.\nSheldon: When I rise to power, those people will be sterilized.\nLeonard: You video-chat with Amy all the time. How is this different?\nSheldon: Don\u2019t you like Amy?\nLeonard: Of course I like Amy.\nSheldon: Well, there\u2019s the difference. (Skype tone rings)\nLeonard: Excuse me, that\u2019s Priya.\nPriya (on screen): Hi, Leonard.\nLeonard: Hey, honey.\nPriya: I miss you.\nLeonard: Oh, I miss you, too.\nSheldon: I miss the old days when your romantic partners could be returned to the video store.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment.\nSheldon: Thanks for letting me stay here while Leonard Skypes with his girlfriend.\nPenny: Oh, it\u2019s no problem. It\u2019s actually kind of nice. You reading, me reading. We\u2019re like an old married couple.\nSheldon: If we were an old married couple, the wife would serve iced tea and snickerdoodles.\nPenny: I don\u2019t have iced tea and snickerdoodles.\nSheldon: A good wife would go to the store.\nPenny: I want a divorce.\nSheldon: Good. On the way to see the lawyer, pick up some tea and cookies. I must say, I am enjoying your new chair.\nPenny: It\u2019s great, isn\u2019t it?\nSheldon: It is. Aligns the lumbar, cradles the coccyx, balances the buttocks. This is a chair worthy of the name.\nPenny: What name?\nSheldon: Chair.\nPenny: Oh, all right, well, I\u2019m glad you like it. I mean, I still can\u2019t get over the fact someone just threw it away.\nSheldon: What?\nPenny: Yeah, it was just sitting on the street. I paid a homeless guy ten bucks to help me get it up here.\nSheldon (jumps up): Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Oh, dear. (Starts stripping off clothing)\nPenny: What is wrong?\nSheldon: I\u2019ve been sitting in garbage!\nPenny: Sheldon, take it easy.\nSheldon: You take it easy! I need to use your shower.\nPenny: I went into this marriage with so much hope.\nSheldon: There\u2019s a wet Band-Aid on the shower floor. (Runs out of apartment).\nCredits sequence.\nScene: Howard\u2019s workshop. \nRaj: This is fun. I\u2019ve never used a hydraulic thermoforming press before.\nHoward: Pretty sweet, huh? This little baby set the university back 175 grand.\nLeonard: That\u2019s three minutes. Should we see what we got?\nHoward: Hang on.\nRaj: Oh, yeah. This is one good-looking panini.\nHoward: Hand me the tuna melt.\nLeonard: Yep.\nHoward: Thank you. How\u2019s it going with the long-distance love affair?\nLeonard: Not easy, but we\u2019re making it work.\nHoward: When you say making it work, does that include doing the cyber nasty?\nLeonard: What?\nHoward: You know, the virtual pickle tickle. The digital bow-chicka-bow-bow.\nRaj: Come on, dude. This is my sister you\u2019re talking about.\nHoward: Hey, Leonard jiggling his junk at her through a webcam has got to be easier for you to deal with than him actually touching her with it.\nLeonard: There\u2019s no junk jiggling. We just talk.\nHoward: Are you insane? With high-speed Internet, you have at your fingertips the greatest advancement in the field of sex since the invention of the washcloth.\nLeonard: I can\u2019t do that.\nHoward: Well, if you don\u2019t, you\u2019re gonna lose Priya to some fancy guy in a turban who grew up with Kama Sutra coloring books.\nRaj: How can you be so racist?\nHoward: Oh, come on, tell me I\u2019m wrong.\nSheldon (entering): Oh, Leonard, good. There you are. I need you to check my head for chair lice.\nLeonard: I did it last night, I\u2019m not doing it again.\nHoward: Just his head, right?\nLeonard: I don\u2019t want to talk about it. You didn\u2019t catch bugs from Penny\u2019s chair.\nSheldon: Yes, I did. And now they\u2019re cavorting at the base of my hair follicles like dancing hippies at the Redwood National Forest.\nLeonard: Sheldon, you do this all the time. You fixate on some crazy idea and then blow it way out of proportion.\nSheldon: Name one time I\u2019ve ever done that.\nLeonard: How about when you put GPS trackers in your garbage because you were convinced North Korean spies were stealing your doodles? The chicken nuggets you were sure were human nuggets. The strangely-shaped cloud that was following you around town. The time you put on my shirt by mistake and were convinced you\u2019d started growing again.\nSheldon: I said, name one. You really need to work on your listening skills.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment door.\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny.\nPenny: Yello.\nSheldon: You need to remove that chair from the building. It\u2019s a health hazard.\nPenny: Okay, relax. I took off the slipcovers, had them dry-cleaned and then fumigated the cushions.\nSheldon: Really?\nPenny: Yeah. It\u2019s cleaner than my couch. Found half a Hot Pocket in there.\nSheldon: It certainly looks okay. Has a strong toxic chemical smell. That\u2019s reassuring.\nPenny: Why don\u2019t you give it a try, Sheldon?\nSheldon: All right. It is a comfortable chair.\nPenny: Why don\u2019t you just admit you overreacted?\nSheldon: No, thank you. (Sees insect. More appear and swarm all over him. He jumps out of a daydream on his own couch. Jumps up and runs out to Penny\u2019s apartment.\nLeonard: It\u2019s like living with a Chihuahua.\nSheldon (at Penny\u2019s door): (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny.\nPenny: What\u2019s up, buttercup?\nSheldon: You have to get rid of the chair.\nPenny: Nope. (Closes door) \nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny.\nPenny: What\u2019s the word, hummingbird?\nSheldon: For your safety, please wait in my apartment as I call the authorities so they may remove the chair of death.\nPenny: No. (Closes door)\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny.\nPenny: What\u2019s the gist, physicist?\nSheldon: Under my authority as a self-appointed member of the Centres for Disease Control street team, these premises are condemned. (Penny tries to close door) As a man with a keen sense of style, I must tell you, that chair does not work with the room. (Penny closes door). (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Penny opens door and waves seat cushion at him. He screams and runs off. She closes door. He sneaks back) (Knock, knock, knock) Penny.\nScene: Leonard\u2019s bedroom.\nLeonard: So, here we are. Back in bed together.\nPriya (on laptop screen): Yep, here we are.\nLeonard: Okay, so I, I, I guess I\u2019ll just jump right in.\nPriya: All right.\nLeonard: Uh, you\u2019re a naughty girl. And, and, uh, I, I want to punish you with my love?\nPriya: What?\nLeonard: Not good?\nPriya: That\u2019s terrible. Try again.\nLeonard: Okay. Uh, uh, you\u2019re not naughty. Uh, you\u2019re, you\u2019re, you\u2019re dirty. You\u2019re, you\u2019re a, a dirty girl?\nPriya: Oh, yes. Yes, I am.\nLeonard: Yeah, yeah. Uh, okay. You\u2019re a, you\u2019re a, you\u2019re a, a dirty, disgusting, revolting girl. Ugh!\nPriya: God, Leonard, stop talking.\nLeonard: Why don\u2019t you just give me five minutes? I\u2019ll Google how to do this. I\u2019ll call you right back.\nPriya: Shh-shh-shh. Just be quiet and do what I tell you.\nLeonard: Okay, like usual. Good.\nPriya: Take off your shirt.\nLeonard: All rightie. Shirt coming off. Ta-da! Man nipples.\nPriya: I said be quiet.\nLeonard: Yes, ma\u2019am.\nPriya: Now take off your shorts.\nLeonard: Taking shorts off. There we go. Naked, naked, naked!\nPriya: Wonderful. Now I\u2019ll take off my clothes.\nLeonard: Cool. (computer screen bugs out) Uh-oh!\nPriya: Here I am, baby. You miss these?\nLeonard: Oh, damn it!\nPriya: Oh, Leonard! Already?\nLeonard: No, no! No-no-no! The screen froze. It\u2019s probably just buffering, just give it a second.\nPriya: Fine.\nLeonard: So, how are your mom and dad?\nPriya: Yeah, I really don\u2019t want to talk about my parents now.\nLeonard: Yeah. Sure, sure.\nSheldon (calling from outside): If your video\u2019s frozen, try resetting the TCP/IP stack.\nLeonard: Oh! I didn\u2019t even think of that. Thanks.\nSheldon (still off): You\u2019re welcome. Please let me know when you and your girlfriend are done hogging the bandwidth for your self-abuse. I\u2019m trying to stream a movie on Netflix in here.\nScene: Amy\u2019s apartment. Amy is playing a harp.\nAmy: Five, six, seven, eight. Tall and tan and young and lovely, the girl from Ipanema goes walking, and when she passes, each one she passes goes\u2026\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy.\nAmy: Oh\u2026 You are aware that your ritualistic knocking behaviour is symptomatic of obsessive compulsive disorder?\nSheldon: Is not. Is not, is not.\nAmy: Denial. Denial, denial. Come in.\nSheldon: Thank you.\nAmy: Would you like to hear me play a bossa nova standard on the harp?\nSheldon: No.\nAmy: How about the theme song to the classic television show Diff\u2019rent Strokes? Now the world don\u2019t move to the beat\u2026\nSheldon: No.\nAmy: Well, that\u2019s every song I know. What\u2019s up?\nSheldon: You\u2019re good friends with Penny, right?\nAmy: Best friends, besties, BFFs, peas in a pod, sisters who would share travelling pants. Go on.\nSheldon: I was hoping she might listen to you about the dangers of owning unhygienic furniture.\nAmy: For general educational purposes, or has she acquired a bar stool dipped in cholera?\nSheldon: Cholera is water-borne. You\u2019re mocking me.\nAmy: Yes, I am.\nSheldon: Penny has dragged a chair in off the street whose unknown provenance jeopardizes the health and welfare of every resident in our building.\nAmy: Sheldon, just because you have a focus on cleanliness bordering on the psychotic doesn\u2019t mean I have to participate.\nSheldon: All right, name your price.\nAmy: Kiss me where I\u2019ve never been kissed before.\nSheldon: You mean like Salt Lake City?\nAmy: Never mind. I\u2019ll talk to Penny.\nSheldon: Thank you.\nAmy: Will you listen to me play my harp now?\nSheldon: No. I dislike the sound of the harp. Its overuse in classic television sitcoms always makes me think I\u2019m going to experience an episode from my past. (Amy plays glissando) I\u2019m sorry, Mommy. Don\u2019t be mad at me. Don\u2019t do that!\nScene: Howard\u2019s workshop. \nLeonard: I don\u2019t know about this, Howard.\nHoward: What? You\u2019re having trouble with the long-distance lovemaking. This is your answer. There are two interfaces that simulate a human mouth. You have one, Priya has one in India. When you move your lips and tongue on yours, it transmits exactly what you\u2019re doing to hers. See? Internet kissing. (Howard kisses device) Give it a try.\nLeonard: I don\u2019t think so.\nRaj: I\u2019ll try it. Like this?\nHoward: Almost. Really get your tongue in there, to activate the motion sensor.\nRaj: Like this?\nHoward: Close. Really French it.\nRaj: Better?\nHoward: Yeah, you got it, you got it.\nRaj: I\u2019m impressed. This is very lifelike.\nHoward: Whoa! You just bit my tongue!\nRaj: I, I nibbled. I was being playful.\nHoward: Why do you have to make everything weird?\nRaj: Sorry. Better?\nHoward: Oh, yeah.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment. \nPenny: Pretty cool, huh? Probably would cost, like, two hundred bucks in a store.\nAmy: I do appreciate a bargain. This entire ensemble once belonged to my dead grandmother.\nPenny: You\u2019re kidding.\nAmy: Everything except bra and panties. And they\u2019re a leopard-spotted secret I share with Victoria.\nPenny: And now me.\nAmy: I just have one question about the chair.\nPenny: And what\u2019s that?\nAmy: Aren\u2019t you worried about it being unhygienic?\nPenny: No, it\u2019s completely fine. Hmm. I get it. Sheldon sent you. He put you up to this.\nAmy: No, he didn\u2019t.\nPenny: Really?\nAmy: Yes, he did. He absolutely did.\nPenny: My God, Amy, that\u2019s really crappy of you.\nAmy: It is?\nPenny: Yeah! Letting Sheldon use you to manipulate me? I thought you were my friend.\nAmy: No, I am your friend. Please don\u2019t be mad at me.\nPenny: I can\u2019t even believe this. You know, maybe you should just go.\nAmy: No, no, I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m so sorry. I take it all back. Look. I\u2019m, uh, I\u2019m sitting in your chair. There\u2019s nothing wrong with it. It\u2019s a great chair. Please let me continue to be part of your world. Ow!\nPenny: What\u2019s wrong?\nAmy: Something in the chair\u2019s biting my tushy. It\u2019s not important. Ow!\nPenny: Wait. Get up, get up! (She does. Something is moving in the seat cushion. They both run out of the apartment screaming.) Swear you won\u2019t tell Sheldon what happened!\nAmy (between screams): I swear! Can I tell my doctor? I\u2019m probably gonna need shots!\nPenny (also still screaming): Yeah, sure!\nScene: Leonard\u2019s bedroom. \nLeonard: Oh, hey, babe, I think I figured this thing out.\nPriya (on screen): Oh, Leonard, listen\u2026\nLeonard: No, you listen. You\u2019re my woman, and I\u2019m gonna make you feel things you have never felt before.\nPriya: Leonard\u2026\nLeonard: That\u2019s right, say my name, and beg me for more, \u2019cause, I\u2019m gonna give it to you.\nPriya: My parents are here.\nDr Koothrappali: Hello, Leonard, if I may also say your name.\nScene: The street outside the apartment block.\nHoward: Check it out. Free chair.\nRaj: Yeah. Hey, you know, if this was in Sheldon and Leonard\u2019s apartment, I wouldn\u2019t wind up sitting on the floor all the time.\nHoward: On three?\nTogether: Three!\nRaj: What kind of idiot throws away a terrific chair like this?\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "3_5": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The apartment.\nHoward: All right, Raj has played his phantom warlord card, and I am going to back him up with my strangling vines. Choke on that, sucka.\nLeonard: Okay, well, then I\u2019ll just cut your vines with my ruby sword. That\u2019s right, I did it. I cut \u2019em.\nPenny: Um, I have a question.\nLeonard: Warlord beats troll, troll beats elf, elf beats water sprite, and basically everything beats enchanted bunny.\nHoward: Unless you have the carrot power.\nPenny: Okay, I\u2019ve got another question. When does this get fun?\nHoward: Are we going to talk or are we going to play Mystic Warlords of Ka-ah?\nLeonard: Just play a potion card.\nPenny: Which one?\nSheldon: It doesn\u2019t matter. You can\u2019t possibly win.\nLeonard: Sheldon, don\u2019t ruin the game.\nPenny: How could he ruin the game?\nSheldon: Given the cards that have already been played, Penny can only be holding necromancer potions, which are only effective against wraiths and day-walkers, and there are no more of either left to be drawn. The cards remaining in the undrawn stack are four fire weapons, a troll, two ogres and the jewel of Osiris.\nLeonard: See? Ruined.\nPenny: Sheldon, that is incredible.\nSheldon: From your vantage point, it certainly must seem so.\nLeonard: Sheldon has kind of a photographic memory.\nSheldon: Photographic is a misnomer. I have an eidetic memory, as I\u2019ve told you many times. Most recently last year during lunch on the afternoon of may seventh. You had turkey and complained it was dry.\nHoward: Well, I guess game\u2019s over.\nPenny: Really? Oh, great. I mean, aw. Okay, I gotta go.\nLeonard: Why?\nPenny: Because the last me I didn\u2019t go, I ended up playing Mystic Warlords of Ka.\nHoward: Not Ka. Ka-ah.\nPenny: Ba-eye.\nLeonard: See ya. Still can\u2019t believe she\u2019s going out with me.\nRaj: Nobody can.\nHoward: That reminds me, I have a bone to pick with you.\nLeonard: What?\nHoward: You and I made a pact that if either of us ever got a hot girlfriend, that person would have his girlfriend hook the other guy up with one of her girlfriends.\nLeonard: Yeah, I don\u2019t remember that.\nSheldon: June 30th, 2004. Opening day of Spider-man 2 at the AMC Pasadena. They only had red icees, no blue.\nLeonard: Oh, yeah.\nHoward: So you\u2019ve been with Penny for like a month and a half now. Where\u2019s my shorty, Morty?\nLeonard: Howard, you can\u2019t hold me to that.\nHoward: Why not?\nLeonard: Because when I made that agreement, I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d ever have a hot girlfriend. And I was positive you never would.\nRaj: Hey, how come I wasn\u2019t part of this deal?\nSheldon: You had left the refreshment stand in order to indulge in your customary preemptive pre-show urination.\nRaj: Oh, so that\u2019s how it works? I have a teeny bladder and now I don\u2019t get a hot girlfriend?\nHoward: Yeah, Raj, that\u2019s how it works.\nRaj: Damn.\nCredits sequence.\n \nScene: The university cafeteria.\nLeonard: Oh, damn it. Can I have a napkin?\nSheldon: I\u2019m sorry, no.\nLeonard: But you have a whole bunch of \u2019em.\nSheldon: Yes, I\u2019ve moved to a four-napkin system. Lap, hands, face and personal emergencies. If you like, starting tomorrow, I\u2019ll add a guest napkin, but I\u2019m afraid there\u2019s nothing I can do for you today. (Leonard steals a napkin) Good luck. That\u2019s the face napkin.\nHoward: So, have you talked to Penny yet?\nLeonard: No, I haven\u2019t.\nHoward: Why not?\nLeonard: Because I\u2019ve been busy, because I haven\u2019t figured out a way to bring it up, and mostly, and I can\u2019t stress how key this is, because I don\u2019t want to.\nHoward: Leonard, a pact is a pact. You have to get Penny to fix me up.\nLeonard: It\u2019s not that simple. What am I supposed to say? Penny, do you have any friends you\u2019d like to never hear from again?\nHoward: Come on, I\u2019m smart, I have good job and I have only three percent body fat.\nRaj: It\u2019s true. I\u2019ve seen him at the beach, he\u2019s like a human chicken wing.\nHoward: Leonard, come on.\nLeonard: Fine. I\u2019ll ask if she has a friend for you.\nHoward: A hot friend.\nLeonard: Right.\nHoward: And tall. I want our kids to be able to ride space mountain before they\u2019re 20.\nLeonard: I\u2019ll see what I can do.\nRaj: Hey, Sheldon, guess what I heard today?\nSheldon: I\u2019d imagine you heard any number of things today. When you arrived at work you undoubtedly heard, hello, Raj, how are you, Raj? Given that you\u2019re wearing a new sweater-vest, you may have heard new sweater-vest? And possibly, though far less likely, nice sweater-vest.\nRaj: Why don\u2019t I just tell you what I heard today.\nSheldon: That would probably save us some time.\nRaj: Saturday night at the comic book store, they\u2019re having a Mystic Warlords of Ka-ah tournament. First prize is five hundred dollars. If we team up, we\u2019d be unstoppable.\nSheldon: I\u2019m sorry, Raj, but I have no interest in playing a game in which I find no challenge.\nRaj: What about the money?\nSheldon: I have money.\nRaj: But this is other money.\nSheldon: How does it different from the money I have?\nRaj: Half of it will be mine.\nSheldon: Do you need it to buy a less disturbing sweater-vest?\nRaj: Leonard, help.\nLeonard: Are you kidding? I couldn\u2019t even talk him into giving me one of his freakin\u2019 napkins.\nScene: Leonard and Penny are in bed.\nPenny: Wow, you really are a genius.\nLeonard: Not really. I googled how to do that. So, listen, have you ever made a pact with someone?\nPenny: You mean, like a pinky swear?\nLeonard: Okay, fine, like a pinky swear.\nPenny: Well, in the first grade, my friend Rosie and I made a pact to marry Bert and Ernie. You know, from Sesame Street?\nLeonard: Yeah, I\u2019m familiar with Bert and Ernie.\nPenny: Then we found out we both wanted Ernie. We didn\u2019t speak again until middle school.\nLeonard: Over puppets?\nPenny: The heart wants what the heart wants, Leonard.\nLeonard: Okay. Speaking of what the heart wants, um, a long time ago, I made a pact with Wolowitz that kind of involves you.\nPenny: Okay, I don\u2019t know where you\u2019re going with this, but tread carefully because it may be the last conversation we ever have.\nLeonard: No, no, nothing like that. The deal was that if either of us ever got a girlfriend, we\u2019d have her fix the other one up with one of her friends.\nPenny: And you thought a good time to bring this up be right after sex.\nLeonard: Well, I sure as hell wasn\u2019t going to bring it up before sex, and during, I was trying to remember what I read on google, so\u2026\nPenny: I\u2019m not hooking Wolowitz up with one of my friends.\nLeonard: Come on, it doesn\u2019t have to be a good friend. And you know that deep down inside, Howard\u2019s a really nice guy.\nPenny: The problem isn\u2019t what\u2019s on the inside. It\u2019s the creepy candy coating.\nLeonard: Will you at least think about it? Just as a favour to me?\nPenny: Oh, great thing about Ernie, was he never asked me for anything. He just gave.\nScene: The comic book store.\nSheldon: Got it. Got it. Got it. Got it. Got it. Got it. Betty and Veronica? Ugh.\nStuart: Hey, Sheldon, the new Green Lantern figurine\u2019s coming in tomorrow. Want me to set one aside for you?\nSheldon: Thank you. You just robbed me of the opportunity to stumble upon the figurine and make the oh-so-satisfying journey from discovery to desire to possession.\nStuart: All right, I won\u2019t set one aside for you.\nSheldon: But I must have it.\nStuart: Okay, I\u2019ll set one aside for you.\nSheldon: Thank you. You know, I can buy all these things online. I come here for the personal service.\nRaj: Hey, Stuart, is the Wil Wheaton signed up for the mystic warlords tournament THE Wil Wheaton from Star Trek?\nStuart: Yeah, he lives around here. Big gamer.\nSheldon: Excuse me. Are you saying that Wil Wheaton aka Ensign Wesley Crusher on Star Trek:\nThe Next Generation is going to be participating in your tournament?\nStuart: Oh, I\u2019m sorry, did I rob you of the opportunity to stumble onto that for yourself?\nSheldon: You don\u2019t understand. Growing up, I idolized Wil Wheaton? Wesley Crusher had an eidetic memory just like me.\nRaj: Oh, what a coincidence. Maybe you can discuss that with him while you\u2019re playing in the tournament. Sign here.\nSheldon: I was such a fan that in 1995, I travelled ten hours by bus to a sci-fi convention in Jackson, Mississippi, wearing my Star Fleet Academy cadet uniform in order to meet Wil Wheaton and get him to autograph my mint in-package Wesley Crusher action figure.\nRaj: Ooh, it\u2019ll be like a reunion then. Sign here.\nSheldon: My arduous journey, however, was for naught. Although advertised to appear, he did not show up. It was at that moment, I vowed eternal hatred for Wil Wheaton.\nRaj: Okay, great, you can tell him you hate him. Sign here.\nSheldon: It might also interest you to know that Wil Wheaton currently ranks sixth on my all-time enemies list, right between director Joel Schumacher, who nearly destroyed the Batman movie franchise, and Billy Sparks, who lived down the street from me and put dog poop on the handles of my bicycle.\nRaj: Okay, I get it, he\u2019s a bad guy. Sign here.\nSheldon: In the words of Khan Noonien Singh in the immortal wrath of Khan, he tasks me, he tasks me and I shall have him.\nRaj: No doubt, sign here.\nSheldon: From hell\u2019s heart, I stab at thee.\nStuart: All right, Raj, looks like you\u2019re teamed up with die, Wil Wheaton, die.\nScene: Leonard\u2019s car.\n \nHoward: So, tell me more about the future mother of my children.\nPenny: She\u2019s adorable, Howard. I think you\u2019ll like her.\nHoward: Great. So what did you tell her about me? Did you mention the body fat?\nPenny: No, I thought that would be a nice surprise for her.\nHoward: Good, good.\nPenny: I just told her you\u2019re an aerospace engineer, you speak five languages\u2026\nHoward: Six if you count Klingon.\nLeonard: Girls don\u2019t count Klingon, Howard. Right?\nPenny: Right. Oh, and I told her you have an unhealthy attachment to your mother.\nHoward: What?\nPenny: I\u2019m kidding.\nLeonard: Another delightful surprise for her.\nScene: The comic book store.\nRaj: Sheldon, it\u2019s your play. Sheldon.\nSheldon: My enchanted troll bludgeons your screaming harpy with a cursed mace. Game.\nRaj: Sorry, boys. Say hi to your mother when she picks you up. Or I could just tell her later tonight! We pwned them, dude! Up top!\nSheldon: Look at him. Wil Wheaton, my old friend, I have chased you round the moons of Nibia and round the Antares maelstrom and round perdition\u2019s flames!\nRaj: You know you keep quoting Wrath of Khan, but he was in next generation. It\u2019s a totally different set of characters.\nSheldon: Silence! How much longer must I wait for my revenge?\nRaj: Well, if Wil Wheaton and Stuart win their match and we beat lonely Larry and Captain Sweatpants in the next round, we\u2019ll face off for the championship.\nSheldon: So, my path to satisfaction is blocked by lonely Larry and Captain Sweatpants. Very well. They must be destroyed.\nRaj: Dude, you have to stop talking like that. It\u2019s really lame.\nSheldon: Silence!\nScene: Leonard\u2019s car.\nHoward: So, Penny tells me you\u2019re working as a waitress to put yourself through grad school. That\u2019s pretty great, what are you studying?\nBernadette: Microbiology.\nHoward: Oh, cool. So you could study me.\nBernadette: I don\u2019t understand.\nHoward: Microbiology is the study of tiny living things.\nBernadette: I know, I\u2019m studying it.\nHoward: And I said you could study me \u2019cause I\u2019m a tiny living thing. It\u2019s a joke.\nBernadette: Are you sure?\nHoward: Do you like science-fiction?\nBernadette: No.\nHoward: Role-playing games?\nBernadette: Like in the bedroom or like Dungeons and Dragons?\nHoward: Either.\nBernadette: No.\nLeonard: Gonna be a long night.\nPenny: Yeah, well, it\u2019s your fault.\nLeonard: I had to ask. You didn\u2019t have to say yes.\nHoward: You like magic?\nBernadette: Not really.\nHoward: Okay.\nLeonard: Long, long night.\nScene: The comic book store.\n \nSheldon: I play my endless serpent. Raj will play ecstatic frenzy, which means Larry will have to play chaos overlord, then Captain Sweatpants, molten river. I play nightshade dryad, game, set and match. Now fetch me Wil Wheaton! bortaS bIr jablu\u2019DI\u2019 reH QaQqu\u2019 nay\u2019\nWil Wheaton: Did that guy just say revenge is a dish best served cold in Klingon?\nStuart: I believe so.\nWil Wheaton: What is wrong with him?\nStuart: Everyone has a different theory.\nScene: A restaurant.\n \nHoward: How about computers? Do you like computers?\nBernadette: I use them. I don\u2019t like them.\nHoward: Okay\u2026 Puppies? Where do you stand on puppies?\nBernadette: A puppy once bit my face.\nHoward: Of course it did.\nLeonard: How about that? Einstein was wrong.\nPenny: What?\nLeonard: Approaching the speed of light doesn\u2019t slow down time. Approaching them does.\nHoward (phone rings): Excuse me. Oh, damn. It\u2019s my mother.\nBernadette: Are you going to answer it?\nHoward: I\u2019m torn. She might be dying, and, you know, I wouldn\u2019t want to miss that. On the other hand, if I let it go to voicemail, I could play it over and over.\nBernadette: I know how you feel. My mother makes me crazy.\nHoward: Not as crazy as my mother makes me.\nBernadette: Oh, yeah? Does your mother call you every day at work to see if you\u2019ve had a healthy lunch?\nHoward: My mother calls me at work to see if I had a healthy bowel movement.\nBernadette: Okay, well, does she lay out your clothes for you in the morning like you\u2019re nine years old?\nHoward: You live with your mother?\nBernadette: No. That\u2019s the sad part.\nHoward: Ooh, rough. Okay, check this out. My mother made me wear rubber gloves to kindergarten so I wouldn\u2019t pick up a disease from the other children.\nBernadette: That\u2019s nothing. I couldn\u2019t ride a bicycle \u2019cause my mother was afraid I\u2019d hit a bump and lose my virginity.\nHoward: Oh, wow. You didn\u2019t, did you?\nBernadette: Not on a bicycle. In a Camry.\nHoward: Corolla!\nBernadette: Oh!\nHoward: More wine?\nBernadette: I\u2019d love some.\nHoward: Listen, you have to come to shabbat dinner at my house sometime.\nBernadette: Why?\nHoward: A catholic girl like you wearing a big cross like that might just give my mother the big brain aneurysm I\u2019ve been hoping for.\nBernadette: Okay, but only if you come to Sunday dinner at my house wearing a yarmulke.\nHoward: It\u2019s a date.\nPenny: Am I a matchmaker or what?\nScene: The comic book store.\nRaj: Lava serpent.\nStuart: Nest of snakes.\nWil Wheaton: Underworld guardian.\nSheldon: Underworld guardian. We skirmish to the death.\nWil Wheaton: Invisibility spell.\nSheldon: Luminescence spell.\nWil Wheaton: Water nymph.\nSheldon: Fire demon.\nWil Wheaton: Two-headed tiger.\nSheldon: Three-headed lion.\nWil Wheaton: Sulphur.\nSheldon: Brimstone.\nRaj: Problem, Wil Wheaton?\nWil Wheaton: Hang on.\nSheldon: You\u2019re holding two moderate spell cards, a small rock and a potion of Zancor, which will be about as much help as an air conditioner on the ice planet Hoth. Your only move is to play the potion, lose the skirmish, and two moves later, the game.\nWil Wheaton: I think he\u2019s got me.\nSheldon: The year was 1995, the place, Jackson, Mississippi. Having spent ten hours on a bus, during which I had to twice violate my personal rule against relieving myself on board a moving vehicle, I finally arrived at the fourth annual Dixie-Trek convention only to find that my idol Wil Wheaton decided he had better things to do than to show up and sign my action figure.\nWil Wheaton: What?\nSheldon: You betrayed me, Wil Wheaton. Now I have my revenge.\nWil Wheaton: You went to the \u201995 Dixie-Trek? Oh, dude, my grandmother had just died, and I had to go to her funeral.\nSheldon: Your mee-maw died? That\u2019s terrible.\nWil Wheaton: Yeah, it was. But I\u2019m really sorry that I disappointed you.\nSheldon: No, no, I understand. Anything happened to my mee-maw, I\u2019d be one inconsolable moon pie. I should clarify that statement by explaining that she calls me moon pie.\nWil Wheaton: It\u2019s special relationship, isn\u2019t it, between a boy and his grandmother?\nSheldon: Oh, yes.\nRaj: Okay, great, everybody loves their grandmas! Now, come on, Sheldon, finish him off!\nWil Wheaton: It\u2019s okay, Sheldon. I let you down. I deserve it. Potion of Zancor.\nRaj: What are you waiting for? Kill Wil Wheaton! From hell\u2019s heart, stab at him!\nSheldon: I can\u2019t.\nRaj: Sure you can. Do it! Do it!\nSheldon: No. I came here to defeat Wil Wheaton, the man who destroyed my dreams. But I can\u2019t defeat Wil Wheaton, the man who loved his mee-maw. Enchanted bunny.\nRaj: No! Not enchanted bunny!\nWil Wheaton: I call my mee-maw nana. And she\u2019s going be very happy to hear that my small rock kills your enchanted bunny. Game over, moon pie.\nSheldon: I\u2026 I\u2026 I don\u2019t understand. Your grandmother\u2019s alive?\nWil Wheaton: Oh, you catch on quick. Come on, Stewie, let\u2019s get our prize money.\nStuart: That was fun.\nSheldon (while camera zooms out from Sheldon to above planet in a pastiche of the famous Wrath of Khan scene): Wheaton!

If you can\u2019t get me to stop eating your food, what makes you think you can get me to stop using your Wi-Fi?\nSheldon: I believe that you\u2019re capable of great change. Like when I finally got you to stop saying Valentimes Day.\nLeonard: You want to hear something weird?\nPenny: Sure.\nSheldon: In the year 2000, Pope John Paul II was named an honorary Harlem Globetrotter.\nLeonard: What are you talking about?\nSheldon: You asked Penny if she wanted to hear something weird.\nLeonard: Yeah, because I have something weird to tell her.\nSheldon: Oh. I thought it was a game.\nPenny: What\u2019s yours?\nLeonard: There\u2019s this guy, Jimmy Speckerman, who used to torment me in high school. He sent me a message through Facebook. He\u2019s in town and wants to have drinks.\nSheldon: Okay, Penny, if it were a game, here are your choices. An e-mail from an old acquaintance, or the head of one of the largest religious institutions in the world slam dunking to Sweet Georgia Brown. Pick.\nLeonard: Just do it, \u2019cause he\u2019s not gonna let it go.\nPenny: Basketball Pope.\nSheldon: And that\u2019s how it\u2019s done.\nPenny: What are you gonna do about your bully? Are you gonna see him?\nLeonard: I don\u2019t know.\nSheldon: Is this the fellow who peed in your Hawaiian Punch?\nLeonard: No, that was a different guy.\nSheldon: Was he the one who wedgied you so hard, your testicle reascended, and you spent your whole Christmas break waiting for it to come back down?\nLeonard: No, that was a different, different guy.\nSheldon: Was he the one who used your head to open a nut?\nLeonard: No.\nSheldon: Oh, oh, oh. Was he the one who made you eat your arm hair?\nLeonard: No, but, actually, that was this guy\u2019s sister.\nPenny: All right, well, what do you think he wants?\nLeonard: I don\u2019t know.\nSheldon: You know, the holidays are just around the corner. Maybe he wants to see if he can lodge the other testicle up there.\nLeonard: I told you. That was a different guy.\nPenny: Hmm. That\u2019s too bad. We could have spent New Year\u2019s Eve waiting for the ball to drop.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: It\u2019s two a.m. What are you doing up?\nSheldon: Nobel Prize acceptance ceremony streaming live from Stockholm.\nLeonard: Sure. You want to see what all the scientists are wearing this year.\nSheldon: Look at these men. They\u2019ve managed to win the top science prize in the world with no more understanding of the quantum underpinnings of the expansion of the early universe than God gave a goose. You should pay attention, Leonard. Someday this could be you up there.\nLeonard: Thanks.\nSheldon: So, what\u2019s got you up? Did you have a bad clam?\nLeonard: I didn\u2019t have clams.\nSheldon: I don\u2019t watch you 24 hours a day. I don\u2019t know what you do.\nLeonard: It\u2019s this Jimmy Speckerman thing. I can\u2019t decide if I should agree to see him or not. Of course that might be because the last time I ran into him, he made me floss with my own shoelaces.\nSheldon: Wear loafers. Look at Dr. Saul Perlmutter up there, clutching that Nobel Prize. What\u2019s the matter, Saul? You afraid someone\u2019s going to steal it? Like you stole Einstein\u2019s cosmological constant?\nLeonard: You know what? I am tired of living in fear of this guy. I\u2019m gonna go see him and finally say all the things I should have said in high school. You know, pick on someone your own size, you did not have sex with my mother, and yes, I do know why I\u2019m hitting myself.\u201d\nSheldon: Oh, now Perlmutter\u2019s shaking the King\u2019s hand. Yeah, check for your watch, Gustaf. He might have lifted it.\nScene: Penny\u2019s bedroom.\nBernadette: I love this dress. How come I never see you wear it?\nPenny: \u2018Cause when I wear it, it\u2019s a shirt. So, what\u2019s Howard doing tonight?\nBernadette: Oh, they all went with Leonard to confront his childhood bully.\nPenny: Oh, terrific. High school quarterback against four mathletes.\nAmy: When Leonard gets back, I\u2019d love to check his serotonin levels. Do you think he\u2019d let me draw a syringe full of his blood?\nPenny: Hmm, he\u2019s not crazy about needles, but if you get him to go jogging, it\u2019ll just pour out of his nose.\nBernadette: I don\u2019t think I can meet the girl who was always mean to me. Tammy Bodnick. One time while I was in gym class, she stole all my clothes and left an elf costume in my locker.\nPenny: Oh, that\u2019s awful.\nBernadette: Worst part was, it was too big.\nAmy: That\u2019s nothing. In ninth grade, the girls put Rogaine in my hand lotion. Within six months, the nicknames began to fly. I think the one that hurt the most was Gorilla Fingers Fowler.\nPenny: Wow. You poor thing.\nBernadette: What about you?\nPenny: Oh. I don\u2019t know. I guess my school was a nice place. We didn\u2019t really have bullies.\nAmy: Come on, no one ever gave anyone mean nicknames or picked on them or put gum in their hairy knuckles so the school nurse had to use peanut butter to get it out?\nPenny: No, we weren\u2019t really like that. I mean, look, we played pranks on each other, but it was never mean. Like, okay, this one girl, Kathy Geiger, got really good grades, so we blindfolded her, tied her up and left her in a cornfield overnight.\nBernadette: Oh, my God, that\u2019s awful.\nPenny: No, it was funny. Everyone laughed.\nAmy: Did Kathy Geiger laugh?\nPenny: Uh, probably. It\u2019s hard to say. She kind of had an ear of corn in her mouth.\nAmy: Who would have thought Fuzzy Fingers Fowler is best friends with a bully?\nPenny: What? I was not a bully.\nBernadette: Kind of sounds like you were. And maybe a felon.\nAmy: Shh. That\u2019s how you wind up in a cornfield.\nScene: A bar.\nRaj: Is that him over there?\nLeonard: No.\nRaj: How about that guy? He looks like he\u2019d hate you.\nLeonard: You know, I can really do this by myself.\nHoward: Hey, we\u2019re here to support you, buddy.\nLeonard: No, you\u2019re not. You\u2019re here to see if I get my underwear pulled over my head.\nHoward: You wore underwear? You fool.\nRaj: So, have you figured out what you\u2019re going to say to him?\nLeonard: You bet. I am going to make him apologize for all the crap he pulled on me in school.\nHoward: That\u2019s quite a list. I can\u2019t read your handwriting, what\u2019s that word?\nLeonard: Scrotum.\nRaj: What\u2019s that one?\nLeonard: Uh, stapled.\nJimmy (arriving): Leonard.\nLeonard: Oh, hi.\nJimmy: Holy crap, man, it\u2019s good to see you.\nLeonard: Yeah. You, too. Uh, Jimmy, this is Sheldon and Raj and Howard.\nJimmy: Hi. Fellas. Hey, can I get a beer? Wow. Look at you. Little Leonard Hofstadter. I hear you\u2019re a big-time scientist now.\nSheldon: And there\u2019s the first zinger. Ouch.\nLeonard: I\u2019m doing okay, I guess.\nJimmy: Okay? Come on, I read online you\u2019re a physicist at a university, you won some medal.\nLeonard: The Newcomb medal.\nJimmy: Yeah, congratulations.\nSheldon: Congratulations? The Newcomb medal? Oh, please. That\u2019s the scientific equivalent of a smiley face sticker on your homework.\nJimmy: From what I read, it sounded like a big deal.\nSheldon: Oh, good Lord, are we going to stand here and listen to him tear Leonard apart like this?\nRaj: Hey, I won a Newcomb medal, too.\nSheldon: My point.\nJimmy: You should have seen this guy back in the day. Huh? He was so little, he could fit in just about anywhere. Lockers, trash cans. Oh, man, how did you get inside that backpack?\nLeonard: Oh, I can\u2019t take all the credit. You helped a lot.\nJimmy: Yeah. We were practically a comedy team.\nHoward: Like the Black Death and Europe.\nLeonard: Jimmy, I\u2019m kind of curious why you wanted to see me.\nJimmy: Okay, here it is. I have this great money-making idea. I just need a gear head to get it to the finish line.\nSheldon: Technically, Howard\u2019s the gear head. Leonard\u2019s just a dime store laser jockey.\nLeonard: What\u2019s the idea?\nJimmy: This is just between us, right?\nLeonard: Right.\nJimmy: Okay. What do you think about a pair of glasses that makes any movie you want into 3D?\nRaj: That sounds amazing. First movie I\u2019m watching, Annie.\nHoward: How exactly would these glasses work?\nJimmy: How the hell should I know? That\u2019s why I need a nerd.\nLeonard: I don\u2019t think something like that\u2019s even possible.\nJimmy: Aw, come on, you can figure it out. You\u2019re like the smartest guy I\u2019ve ever known.\nSheldon: The smartest? All right, you know, I may not have a firm grasp on sarcasm, but even I know that was a doozy. Leonard, you can\u2019t live in fear of this man forever.\nLeonard: Sheldon, I got this.\nSheldon: You clearly don\u2019t. What my spineless friend lacks the courage to say is you\u2019re a terrible person who took advantage of his tiny size, his uncoordinated nature and his congenital lack of masculinity.\nLeonard: Sheldon.\nSheldon: Leonard, I platonically love you, man, but face it, you\u2019re a mess.\nJimmy: I don\u2019t understand.\nLeonard: I think what he\u2019s trying to say is that maybe in high school you picked on me a little bit.\nSheldon: A little bit? The man Super Glued Hershey\u2019s Kisses to your nipples.\nRaj: That\u2019s funny because those aren\u2019t the kind of kisses you want on your nipples.\nJimmy: What is that?\nSheldon: This is a list of your heinous acts against Leonard. One of which is certainly the cause of him wetting his bed well into his teens.\nLeonard: 14 is not, oh , yeah, never mind.\nJimmy: What\u2019s this word?\nLeonard: Nancy. You called me Nancy for three years.\nSheldon: You really need to work on your penmanship.\nJimmy: Oh, man, I, I don\u2019t know what to say. I always thought we were just having some fun.\nLeonard: It wasn\u2019t fun for me.\nSheldon: You\u2019re being too kind, Leonard. You ruined him.\nLeonard: Come on, guys.\nRaj: That was pretty badass, dude.\nSheldon: I help the weak. It\u2019s yet another way I\u2019m exactly like Batman.\nLeonard: Hey, for the record, Jimmy wasn\u2019t the reason I wet the bed. That one has my mother written all over it.\nScene: Penny\u2019s bedroom. Penny is on the phone.\nPenny: Anyway, I\u2019m really sorry I made fun of your stutter in high school.\nBernadette: You\u2019re doing great.\nPenny: Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Oh, God, just finish the sentence. Okay, well, I\u2019m sorry you feel that way. Bye. No one wants to hear my apologies.\nAmy: I think your mistake is doing it over the phone. If they could look into your eyes, they\u2019d melt.\nBernadette: Penny, it doesn\u2019t matter what you did in the past. You\u2019re a good person now.\nPenny: That\u2019s easy for you to say. You weren\u2019t just called a b-b-b-b-bitch.\nAmy: Perhaps you could assuage your guilt through altruism. Which word\u2019s tripping you up? Assuage or altruism?\nPenny: Both.\nBernadette: You\u2019ll feel better by doing something nice for someone.\nPenny: I actually knew that.\nAmy: I never doubted you.\nBernadette: Every other week I serve at a soup kitchen downtown.\nPenny: Ooh, I can\u2019t do that. If I stand over a steaming pot, my hair just goes boing! What else could I do?\nAmy: There\u2019s Habitat for Humanity, building houses for the poor.\nPenny: Okay, come on, I don\u2019t even have my own house, I\u2019m going to build one for someone else?\nAmy: How about donating some of your clothes?\nPenny: Oh, my God, that\u2019s perfect. \u2018Cause I have so many clothes I don\u2019t wear, and they\u2019re just taking up space, and I go shopping to buy more stuff and I have no place to put it. This will totally fix that.\nBernadette: What about helping people?\nPenny: And helping people.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: Here\u2019s your cocoa.\nSheldon: Oh, half and half instead of whole milk?\nLeonard: Yes.\nSheldon: Heated to precisely 183 degrees?\nLeonard: Yes.\nSheldon: Seven little marshmallows, no more no less?\nLeonard: You got one for good luck. (Knock on door) I\u2019ll get it.\nSheldon: One for good luck. Must be the kind of math they do at Princeton.\nJimmy: Hey.\nLeonard: What are you doing here?\nJimmy: I want to apologize for stapling your balls and throwing you naked in the girls\u2019 locker room, stuffing that parrot down your pants. What\u2019s this word?\nLeonard: Laxative.\nJimmy: Oh, right. Junior prom. That was not cool, man. I am so, so sorry.\nLeonard: Really?\nJimmy: Yeah. I just hope you can forgive me.\nLeonard: Uh, yeah. Sure, I guess.\nJimmy: You\u2019re a beautiful guy.\nLeonard: Well, yeah, thanks, Jimmy.\nJimmy: Okay, I got to go.\nLeonard: Are you okay to drive?\nJimmy: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I drive better drunk. You know, it makes you pay attention.\nLeonard: No, no, no, come on in. I\u2019ll make you a cup of coffee.\nJimmy: I wouldn\u2019t be imposing?\nLeonard: No.\nSheldon: Yes.\nLeonard: Sheldon, we can\u2019t let him drive.\nSheldon: Then take away his keys and make him wander the streets with the other drunks.\nLeonard: You remember Sheldon and Raj and Howard.\nJimmy: Not really, no. It\u2019s funny, huh, Leonard? Back in school, I was the winner and you were the loser. And now we\u2019re reversed. You\u2019re the winner.\nSheldon: You\u2019d think a winner could make a decent cup of cocoa.\nJimmy: You mind if I use your bathroom?\nLeonard: Yeah, just back there.\nHoward: How about that? After all these years, your big bad high school bully finally apologizes.\nLeonard: Yeah. It kind of rekindles your faith in the basic goodness of people.\nSheldon: You know what would be nice?\nRaj: What\u2019s that?\nSheldon: As a symbolic gesture to all the bullies who\u2019ve tormented us for years, we open our home to Jimmy and once he\u2019s asleep we kill him. I said it would be nice, I didn\u2019t say we should do it.\nScene: The clothing bank.\nPenny: Ah, I feel just like Mother Teresa. Except for the virgin part. That ship sailed a long time ago.\nBernadette: I think Mother Teresa would have washed the clothes first.\nPenny: Yeah, well, I bet her laundry room wasn\u2019t down five flights of stairs. You know, giving really is better than receiving. I used to think it was such a cliche, but it seems to be the\u2026 oh, look at these cute jeans someone just threw away.\nBernadette: Donated.\nPenny: Yes, to a poor waitress who loves a boot cut.\nBernadette: Penny.\nPenny: Come on, they would be so cute on me, and, ah, they go great with this sweater!\nAmy: I don\u2019t think Mother Teresa\u2026 Oh, that is adorable.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Leonard.\nLeonard: Yeah.\nSheldon: In case it comes up again, this right here is an imposition.\nLeonard: What was I supposed to do? He needed a place to sleep it off.\nSheldon: You\u2019re soft. This world\u2019s going to chew you up and spit you out.\nJimmy (belching): When did I have tacos?\nLeonard: Morning, Jimmy.\nSheldon: Oh, there it is, tacos.\nJimmy: Man, I tied one on.\nLeonard: Yeah, you did. So, uh, listen, it was great to see you again. And , and, and thanks for the apology.\nJimmy: What apology?\nLeonard: For all the crappy stuff you did to me in high school.\nJimmy: Geez, you\u2019re still harping on that? What a puss.\nLeonard: That\u2019s my French toast.\nJimmy: It\u2019s good. You really know your way around a kitchen, Nancy.\nSheldon: I\u2019m not going to say I told you so, but we could have killed him.\nLeonard: I might kill him right now.\nSheldon: The Dark Knight has your back. He\u2019s scared, but he has your back.\nLeonard: Okay, Jimmy, it\u2019s time for you to go.\nJimmy: Yeah, all right, let me just finish this.\nLeonard: No, you\u2019re done. I want you out of my apartment right now.\nSheldon: Well said, Boy Wonder.\nJimmy: Or what?\nSheldon: Don\u2019t answer that. It\u2019s a trick question. I speak from experience.\nLeonard: I\u2019m not afraid of you any more, Jimmy. Now get out! (Pushes him) Uh-oh.\nScene: Running down the stairwell.\nSheldon: You did it, Leonard, you stood up to your bully.\nLeonard: Yeah, I feel pretty good about myself. You think we can outrun him?\nSheldon: I don\u2019t need to outrun him, I just need to outrun you.\nScene: The clothes bank.\nBernadette: I don\u2019t feel good about this.\nPenny: Then sit in the car and keep it running.\nAmy: You were right, a whole new load.\nPenny: Come on, yoga top. Mama needs a new yoga top.\nAmy: Check it out, Bernadette, suede boots, your size.\nBernadette: God, they\u2019re cute.

What are we doing?\nAmy: I was gleefully following you to a life of crime, looking forward to the day we might be cell mates. I don\u2019t know about Bernadette.\nPenny: You know, this is wrong.

So, do you find the weather satisfying? Are you currently sharing in the triumph of some local sports team?\nPenny: What\u2019s wrong with you? you\u2019re freaking me out.\nSheldon: I\u2019m striking up a casual conversation with you. S\u2019u\u2019up?\nPenny: Please don\u2019t do that.\nSheldon: All right, But I\u2019m given to understand that when you have something awkward to discuss with someone, it\u2019s more palatable to preface it with banal chit chat.\nPenny: So, this wasn\u2019t the awkward part?\nSheldon: No.\nPenny: Oh, all right. S\u2019u\u2019up?\nSheldon: Oh, good, I used that right. Anyway, you\u2019re aware that Leonard has entered into a new romantic relationship which includes a sexual component?\nPenny: Okay, feeling the awkward now.\nSheldon: Her name is Dr. Stephanie Barnett and she is a highly distinguished surgical resident at Freemont Memorial.\nPenny: Yeah, Leonard told me.\nSheldon: Good. What he may have left out is how important this relationship is to me.\nPenny: To you?\nSheldon: Yes, see, of the handful of women Leonard\u2019s been involved with, she\u2019s the only one I have ever found tolerable.\nPenny: Well, what about me?\nSheldon: The statement stands for itself.\nPenny: Well, aren\u2019t you sweet?\nSheldon: Anyway, should you have any interaction with her, it would be most helpful that she not see you as a sexual rival.\nPenny: Yeah, I think she\u2019s pretty safe.\nSheldon: You say that now, but consider the following scenario, you\u2019re sitting in your apartment, it\u2019s late, you\u2019re alone, your hypothalamus is swimming in a soup of estrogen and progesterone and suddenly even Leonard seems like a viable sexual candidate, or a, uh, hookup as it\u2019s referred to by today\u2019s urban youth.\nPenny: Really?\nSheldon: Yes. Now, should that happen, I would ask you to find some way to suppress your libido.\nPenny: I could think about you.\nSheldon: Fine, whatever works.\nPenny: Always nice talking to you, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Uh, peace out!\nCredits sequence. \n\u00a0\nScene: The apartment.\n\u00a0\nSheldon: Well, this is very pleasant.\nLeonard: I\u2019m glad you\u2019re enjoying yourself.\nSheldon: And you said there\u2019d never be enough pasta for the three of us.\nLeonard: I stand corrected.\nSheldon: You know, Italian housewives have a rule of thumb. A handful of dry pasta about an inch in diameter is sufficient for each person as it doubles in volume when cooked.\nSteph: That\u2019s very interesting.\nSheldon: Thank you.\nLeonard: She doesn\u2019t mean it. She\u2019s just being nice.\nSheldon: Well, Stephanie, since Leonard seems to be dropping the conversational ball, I guess I\u2019ll just have to pick it up. Have you ever witnessed a violent crime?\nSteph: No.\nSheldon: Good. What\u2019s your favourite fruit?\nSteph: Ih-uh, strawberries.\nSheldon: Hmm, technically not a fruit, but all right. Where did you do your medical internship?\nSteph: Uh, Lawrence Memorial in Galveston, Texas.\nSheldon: Really? That\u2019s where I was born!\nSteph: You\u2019re kidding!\nSheldon: I spent so much of my childhood at that hospital. When I was 12, I got to ride there in a helicopter.\nSteph: Why, what-what-what happened?\nSheldon: Radiation burns. A little mishap while I was building my own cat scanner.\nSteph: I\u2019m sorry, you tried to build your own cat scanner?\nSheldon: No, I didn\u2019t try, I succeeded. In fact, I was briefly able to see the inside of my sister\u2019s guinea pig, Snowball, before he caught fire. It led to an interesting expression in our house, not a snowball\u2019s chance in a cat scanner.\nLeonard: Uh, Sheldon?\nSheldon: Excuse me. When I come back, just for fun, the subject will be alternative history. Specifically, how would the civil war have gone differently if Lincoln had been a robot sent from the future? (To Leonard) Look at that, there\u2019s even pasta left over.\nLeonard: Do you understand that this was supposed to be a date?\nSheldon: I do. Do you? Because frankly, you\u2019ve been in a foul mood since I sat down.\nLeonard: Okay, here\u2019s my question, why did you sit down?\nSheldon: To help. Look, if you fail at this relationship, and history suggests you will, then we risk losing the medical officer that our landing party has always needed.\nLeonard: What landing party?\nSheldon: You\u2019re Kirk, I\u2019m Spock, Wolowitz is Scotty, Koothrappali is the guy who always gets killed, and now we\u2019ve got McCoy.\nScene: A cinema.\nSteph: So, we\u2019re all standing around looking at the post-op x ray and there it is, clear as day, right in the guy\u2019s chest cavity, one of my earrings.\nLeonard: Oh, my god, what did you do?\nSteph: What do you think I did? I discreetly slipped off the other earring, put it in my pocket and then got the hell out of there!\nSheldon (arriving): I have a bone to pick with you, sir.\nLeonard: Oo-oo-oh!\nSteph: Hi, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Hi, Stephanie. I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m late, but your companion left the most indecipherable invitation.\nLeonard: What invitation?\nSheldon: We\u2019re going to the movies. What movie? What theatre? What time? If you were trying to make it impossible to locate you, you couldn\u2019t have done a better job.\nLeonard: Oh, clearly I could have.\nSheldon: It took me nearly 20 minutes to go through the browser history on your computer to see what movie times you looked up. Wait here, I\u2019ll find us seats.\nSteph: No, no, we have seats.\nLeonard: Not the right seats. (Sheldon moves around the theatre sitting in various seats and shouting \u201cHa!\u201d)\nSteph: What is he doing?\nLeonard: He\u2019s finding the acoustic sweet spot.\nSteph: Does he always do this?\nLeonard: Sometimes he brings a toy xylophone. I am really sorry about this.\nSteph: No, it\u2019s fine. you know, he\u2019s sweet.\nSheldon: My apologies, you\u2019ve been sitting in it all along. Leonard, you want to slide over one?\nLeonard: No, just sit here.\nSheldon: Oh, yeah, this is it.\nScene: Outside Leonard\u2019s bedroom. \nSheldon (Knock, knock, knock) : Leonard (knock, knock, knock)  Leonard (knock, knock, knock)  Leonard.\nLeonard: What, Sheldon? What, Sheldon? What, Sheldon?\nSheldon (showing him laptop): Tell me what you see here.\nLeonard: The blunt instrument that will be the focus of my murder trial?\nSheldon: This is Stephanie\u2019s facebook page. Now, where it should say in a relationship, what does it say?\nLeonard: Stephanie Barnett is single.\nSheldon: Yeah, furthermore, earlier this evening, she threw a digital sheep at some guy named Mike. Who\u2019s Mike? Why does he get a digital sheep and not you?\nLeonard: It\u2019s just her facebook page and we\u2019ve only been going out a couple of weeks.\nSheldon: You don\u2019t see it, do you? We\u2019re losing her.\nLeonard: Okay, I\u2019m going to make this very simple for you. You are not in this relationship, I am. Ergo, you have no say in anything that happens between me and Stephanie.\nSheldon: I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t allow that. Pursuant to Starfleet General Order 104 Section A, you are deemed unfit and I hereby relieve you of your command.\nLeonard: General Order 104, Section A does not apply in this situation.\nSheldon: Give me one good reason why not.\nLeonard: Because this is not Star Trek\nScene: Outside Penny\u2019s door.\n\u00a0\nSheldon (Knock, knock, knock) : Penny (knock, knock, knock)  Penny (knock, knock, knock)  Penny.\nPenny: What?\nSheldon: This is banana bread.\nPenny: This is a door knob.\nSheldon: It\u2019s my understanding that an unsolicited gift of food can be a precursor to an impromptu invitation to come in and chat.\nPenny: Sheldon, would you like to come in?\nSheldon: I suppose I could spare a few minutes. Were you robbed?\nPenny: No.\nSheldon: How can you be sure?\nPenny: Sheldon, what do you want?\nSheldon: I\u2019m certain this will come as no surprise to you, but Leonard is failing in yet another relationship.\nPenny: He\u2019s having problems with Stephanie?\nSheldon: She\u2019s sending virtual livestock to random men on the internet. If I have any hope of keeping them together, I need data. Specifically, I need to know exactly what Leonard did that caused you to pop an emotional cap in his buttocks.\nPenny: What?\nSheldon: Again, urban slang. In which, I believe I\u2019m gaining remarkable fluency. So, what is the down and the low? And don\u2019t worry, this is all entirely confidential, so, you feel free to include any and all shortcomings in the bedroom.\nPenny: We never got to the bedroom.\nSheldon: Because?\nPenny: Oh, okay, all right, you know what? I\u2019ll tell you what happened. We were young, we were very much in love, but we could only communicate through a time-traveling mailbox at my lake house.\nSheldon: It\u2019s not enough that you made me watch that movie, but now you mock me with it?\nScene: The university cafeteria.\nSheldon: Gentlemen, I have a question about dating and relationships.\nRaj: You told me you were going to have the talk with him.\nHoward: I\u2019ve been waiting for someone to have the talk with me.\nSheldon: More to the point, it\u2019s about finding a way to keep Leonard and Stephanie together.\nHoward: Oh, I don\u2019t think you can.\nSheldon: Well, why not?\nHoward: Look at Leonard\u2019s record. 27 days with Joyce Kim.\nRaj: During which she defected to North Korea.\nHoward: Two booty calls with Leslie Winkle.\nRaj: For which she awarded him the nickname \u201cspeed of light Leonard.\u201d\nHoward: And a three hour dinner with Penny.\nRaj: Which would have been two and a half if they ordered the souffle when they sat down.\nHoward: Based on the geometric progression, his relationship with Stephanie should have ended after 20 minutes.\nSheldon: Yes, I\u2019m aware of the math, Y equals 27 days over 12 to the nth, the issue remains, how do we circumvent his inevitable rejection?\nRaj: Well, if you want to guarantee his appeal to Stephanie, your best bet would be to kill all the other men on the planet.\nHoward: I\u2019ll tell you what you shouldn\u2019t do. Don\u2019t spritz him with that body spray from the commercial where the women undress when they smell it, that doesn\u2019t work at all, no matter how much you put on.\nSheldon: So, that\u2019s all you\u2019ve got? Apocalyptic genocide and go easy on the cologne?\nHoward: Yes.\nRaj: Yeah.\nScene: Outside Penny\u2019s door.\n\u00a0\nSheldon (Knock, knock, knock) : Penny (knock, knock, knock)  Penny.\nPenny: What?\nSheldon (Knock, knock, knock) : Penny. Zucchini bread.\nPenny: Oh, thank you.\nSheldon: May I come in?\nPenny: No.\nSheldon: I see. Apparently my earlier inquiry regarding you and Leonard crossed some sort of line. I apologize.\nPenny: Well, thank you.\nSheldon: So, have you and I returned to a social equilibrium?\nPenny: Yes.\nSheldon: Great. New topic. Where are you in your menstrual cycle?\nPenny: What?\nSheldon: I\u2019ve been doing some research online, and apparently female primates, you know, uh, apes, chimpanzees, you, they find their mate more desirable when he\u2019s being courted by another female. Now, this effect is intensified when the rival female is secreting the pheromones associated with ovulation. Which brings me back to my question, where are you in (Penny slams door). Clearly, I\u2019m 14 days too early.\nScene: The apartment. \nLeonard: All I\u2019m saying is if they can cure yellow fever and malaria, why can\u2019t they do something about lactose intolerance?\nSteph: Leonard, you\u2019re going to have to let this go. You had a little cheese dip, you farted, I thought it was cute.\nSheldon: Oh, hi Stephanie.\nSteph: Hi.\nLeonard: Want some more wine?\nSteph: Yeah, I assume I\u2019m not driving anywhere tonight. (Sheldon lets out a loud noise).\nLeonard: What are you doing?\nSheldon: I have a craving for white asparagus that apparently is destined to go unsatisfied.\nLeonard: Excuse me. What the hell is wrong with you?\nSheldon: I\u2019m helping you with Stephanie.\nLeonard: By making constipated moose sounds?\nSheldon: When I fail to open this jar and you succeed it will establish you as the alpha male. You see, when a female witnesses an exhibition of physical domination she produces the hormone oxytocin. If the two of you then engage in intercourse this will create the biochemical reaction in the brain which lay people naively interpret as falling in love.\nLeonard: Huh? Would it work if I just punched you in the face?\nSheldon: Yes, actually it would, but let\u2019s see how the lid goes. I\u2019m not strong enough, Leonard, you\u2019ll have to do it.\nLeonard: Oh, for god\u2019s sakes.\nSheldon: Go ahead, it\u2019s pre-loosened.\nSteph: Do you want some help with that?\nLeonard: No, no, no, I got it.\nSheldon: No, yeah, yeah, he\u2019s got it, and that\u2019s not surprising. This is something I long ago came to peace with in my role as the beta male. Open it. (Leonard tries again. Then taps jar on counter. Jar breaks.)\nSteph: Oh my god, are you okay?\nLeonard: No, I\u2019m not. I\u2019m bleeding.\nSheldon: Like a gladiator!\nSteph: Oh, honey, you\u2019re going to need stitches.\nLeonard: Stitches? With a needle?\nSteph: Well, yeah, I mean, just a few.\nLeonard: Oh, okay, yeah, hang on a sec. (Throws up in sink)\nSheldon: FYI, I was defrosting a steak in there.\nScene: The hospital.\nSheldon: What a beautiful job Stephanie did. I might have gone with a mattress suture instead of a blanket stitch, but you can\u2019t argue with her results. It\u2019s a shame it won\u2019t scar, the war wound is a time-honoured badge of masculinity.\nLeonard: I can\u2019t remember a time when you weren\u2019t talking.\nSheldon: Just for the record, my efforts to establish you as the alpha male were not aided by you bursting into tears.\nLeonard: I did not burst into tears, my eyes just got a little watery.\nSheldon: Watery?\nLeonard: She stuck a needle into my hand!\nSteph: Hey, how\u2019s my big cry baby?\nLeonard: I didn\u2019t cry.\nSteph: Okay, I\u2019m just teasing you. But, yeah, you did. Alright, it\u2019s all good. what do you say we get you home and put you to bed?\nLeonard: Oh, are you still going to spend the night?\nSteph: Uh, no, I think that you probably need to rest.\nSheldon: She\u2019s right, as long as you\u2019re vomiting, coitus is contra-indicated.\nLeonard: Thank you, Dr. Cooper.\nSheldon: You\u2019re welcome, Dr. Hofstadter.\nSteph: Okay, I\u2019m going to go get your discharge papers.\nLeonard (after Sheldon tuts): What?\nSheldon: Well, you seem like a perfectly pleasant person. I just can\u2019t understand why women have such a hard time loving you.\nScene: The Apartment.\n\u00a0\nLeonard: Hey, can you open this for me?\nRaj: Can I see your stitches?\nLeonard: Sure. (Holds out hand. Howard starts to retch).\nRaj: Answering the question once and for all why Wolowitz bailed out of medical school.\nPenny (entering): Leonard, congratulations.\nLeonard: What for?\nPenny: Your facebook status update. Leonard Hofstadter is in a relationship.\nLeonard: What? no. no, that\u2019s not right.\nHoward: Oh, man, did you switch your status before she did? Speaking as an expert, way to look needy.\nPenny: Seriously? You went first, after only two weeks? That\u2019s bold.\nLeonard: It\u2019s not bold, it\u2019s a mistake. I didn\u2019t change my status.\nPenny: Well, then who did?\nSheldon: I had no choice, he cried in front of her.\nLeonard: You hacked my facebook account?\nSheldon: Oh, it\u2019s hardly hacking when you use the same password for everything, Kal-el.\nLeonard: Are you insane? Now she\u2019s going to think I\u2019m desperate. You\u2019ve destroyed this relationship! And you want to know what the worst part is? You don\u2019t even understand what you did wrong because you can\u2019t conceive of something that you are not an expert in!\nSheldon: In which I am not an expert.\nLeonard: Don\u2019t even! I don\u2019t want to hear another word out of you.\nPenny (after Raj lets out a noise): What\u2019s wrong, Lassie? Timmy fall down the well? (He points) Oh, wow. She just updated her facebook status.\nHoward: Stephanie Barnett is in a relationship with Leonard Hofstadter.\u201d\nLeonard: Really? Oh, look at that, I have a girlfriend.\nSheldon: If I am permitted to speak again, Dr. Sheldon Cooper for the win.\n\u00a0\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "2_4": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The apartment.

Don\u2019t!\nSheldon: I\u2019ll tell you why.\nLeonard and Howard: O-o-o-oh!\nSheldon: I had to sanitize my hands because the university replaced the paper towels in the rest rooms with hot air blowers.\nPenny: I thought the blowers were more sanitary?\nLeonard and Howard: Why? Don\u2019t!\nSheldon: Hot air blowers are incubators and spewers of bacteria and pestilence. Frankly it would be more hygienic if they just had a plague infested gibbon sneeze my hands dry.\nRaj (entering excitedly): Hey guys, I just got the most amazing new\u2026 (spots Penny) ew-ew-ew\nPenny: Gosh, Raj, do you think you\u2019ll ever be able to talk in front of me without being drunk?

Anyway, because of my discovery, People magazine is naming me one of their thirty under-30 to watch.\nLeonard and Howard together: Well, wow, that\u2019s incredible.\nSheldon: Excuse me. Thirty what, under thirty what, to watch what?\nRaj: Thirty visionaries under thirty years of age to watch as they challenge the preconceptions of their fields.\nSheldon: If I had a million guesses I never would have gotten that.\nRaj: It\u2019s pretty cool, they\u2019ve got me in with a guy who\u2019s doing something about hunger in Indonesia, and a psychotherapist who\u2019s using dolphins to rehabilitate prisoners, and Ellen Page, star of the charming independent film Juno.\nHoward: Oh, I\u2019d so do her.\nLeonard: You\u2019d do the dolphins.\nHoward: Do I get an honourable mention for designing the telescope camera mounting bracket you used.\nRaj: Sorry, it\u2019s not part of my heartwarming and personal narrative, in which a humble boy from New Delhi overcame poverty and prejudice and journeyed to America to reach for the stars.\nHoward: Poverty? Your father\u2019s a gynaecologist, he drives a Bentley.\nRaj: It\u2019s a lease.\nSheldon: I\u2019m confused. Was there some sort of peer review committee to determine which scientists would be included?\nRaj: Peer review? It\u2019s People magazine. People picked me.\nSheldon: What people?\nRaj: The people from People.\nSheldon: Yeah, but exactly who are these people? What are their credentials, how are they qualified, what makes accidentally noticing a hunk of rock that\u2019s been traipsing around the solar system for billions of years more noteworthy than any other scientific accomplishment made by someone under thirty?\nRaj: Boy, I bet Ellen Pages friends aren\u2019t giving her this kind of crap.\nLeonard: Are you proud of yourself?\nSheldon: In general, yes.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: Sheldon\u2019s office.

No, I beg to differ. Of the three of us, I was by far the most supportive.\nLeonard: Really, do tell.\nSheldon: How will Raj ever reach true greatness if his friends lower the bar for him? When I was eleven, my sister bought our father a \u201cworld\u2019s greatest dad\u201d coffee mug, and frankly the man coasted until the day he died.\nLeonard: Okay, let\u2019s try it this way, what if the People magazine thing is the best Raj is ever going to achieve?\nSheldon: I had not considered that.\nLeonard: Come on.\nSheldon: I often forget other people have limitations.

Look at me, I could be grinding on the fact that without my stabilizing telescope mount he never would have found that stupid little clump of cosmic schmutz, but I\u2019m bigger than that.\nSheldon: Fine, what do you want me to do?\nLeonard: Smile.

Boys, I\u2019ve got a question for you. Who in this room discovered a star?\nRaj: Actually, 2008 NQ sub 17 is a planetary body.\nGablehauser: I\u2019m not talking about you, I\u2019m talking about me. You, my exotic young friend are my star.\nSheldon: Well, you didn\u2019t discover him, you merely noticed he was here, much like he did with 2008 NQ sub 17.\nLeonard: Sheldon!\nSheldon: Oh, sorry.

(Smiles) \nGablehauser: Let me ask you something, what do you think the business of this place is?\nLeonard (after he, Sheldon and Howard whisper to each other): Science?\nGablehauser: Money.\nHoward: Told you.\nGablehauser: And this boy\u2019s picture in People magazine is going to raise us a pile of money taller than\u2026 well, taller than you (ruffling Howard\u2019s hair.) \nHoward: I have a master\u2019s degree.\nGablehauser: Who doesn\u2019t? Dr Koothrappali, have you ever had lunch in the President\u2019s dining room?\nRaj: I didn\u2019t even know there was a President\u2019s dining room.\nGablehauser: It\u2019s the same food as the Cafeteria, only fresh. Come on little buddy.\nRaj: Okay, big buddy. See you tonight guys.

They shot me in front of a starry background where I posed like this. (Stares into space.) They\u2019re going to digitally add a supernova, they say it\u2019s the perfect metaphor for my incandescent talent.\nSheldon: Right, a ball of hot flaming gas that collapses in on itself. (Leonard nudges him. He smiles. Phone rings.) \nRaj: Excuse me. Oh, it\u2019s my assistant Trevor. Go for Koothrappali. Uh-huh.\nHoward: They gave him an assistant? If I want a new pen I have to go to the bank with wire cutters.\nSheldon (still smiling): Have we at this point met our social obligations?\nLeonard: Not yet.\nRaj: Okay, just put it on my calendar but start thinking of a reason why I can\u2019t go, alrighty? Koothrappali out. God bless that boy, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do without him.\nLeonard: You just got him this afternoon.\nRaj: Yes, but I\u2019m finding that having a lackey suits me.\nLeonard: A lackey?\nRaj: Oh, I\u2019m sorry, is that politically incorrect? In India we just call them untouchables.\nSheldon: Now?\nLeonard: Almost.\nRaj: Speaking of untouchables, I\u2019ve got great news for you guys. People magazine is having a reception this Saturday, and I managed to get you invited.\nHoward: Oh, gee, thanks.\nRaj: Oh, you\u2019re welcome. Of course, I couldn\u2019t get you into the VIP section, because, you know, that\u2019s for VIPs, and you guys are just, you know, Ps.\nSheldon: There\u2019s a tribe in Papua New Guinea where, when a hunter flaunts his success to the rest of the village they kill him, and drive away evil spirits with a drum made of his skin.

(Smiles)\nPenny (bringing another grasshopper): Here you go, Raj, you might want to drink this one slowly.\nRaj: Okay, so, Saturday night, can I count on my posse?\nHoward: Gee, I\u2019d love to Raj, but I can\u2019t make it.\nRaj: Oh, okay, Leonard?\nLeonard: Well, uh, no I\u2026 the\u2026 no.\nRaj: Sheldon?\nSheldon: I can make it, but I won\u2019t.\nPenny: What are you guys talking about?\nRaj: Well, there\u2019s a reception for my magazine article on Saturday.\nPenny: And you guys aren\u2019t going? I can\u2019t believe you, Raj is celebrating a tremendous accomplishment and you\u2019re not even going to be there to support him?\nSheldon: A tremendous accomplishment would be if the planetary body he discovered were plummeting toward Earth and he exploded it with his mind.\nHoward: That would be cool. I\u2019d go to that reception.\nPenny: Come on, this is huge, Raj is going to be in People magazine. And he didn\u2019t even have to knock up one of the Spears sisters.\nRaj: Would you like to go with me?\nPenny: Of course I would, I would be honoured.\nRaj: Really? Cool.\nPenny: Shame on you guys. (Leaves)\nRaj: Look at that. I got a date with Penny. I can\u2019t believe it took you a whole year.\nSheldon: Now?\nLeonard: Now. (They all get up and leave. Raj looks around himself, then leans over to the next table.)\nRaj: Hey, buddy. I\u2019m going to be in people magazine.\nCharlie Sheen (turning round): Yeah, call me when you\u2019re on the cover.\nScene: Outside Penny\u2019s door. Raj in a suit knocks on the door with his foot as he has a glass of champagne in both hands. He drinks one. Penny opens door, she is dressed up also.\nPenny: Oh, Raj, look at you!\nRaj: I know, I am resplendent like the noonday sun, am I not?\nPenny: Um, yeah, starting with the champagne a little early aren\u2019t you?\nRaj: It was in the limo. They sent a limo. I have a limo. I just love saying limo. Here, sip on this while you\u2019re getting ready.\nPenny: Oh, I\u2019m ready.\nRaj: That\u2019s what you\u2019re wearing.\nPenny: Um, yeah, why what\u2019s wrong with it?\nRaj: Nothing, I was just hoping for something a little more, you know, redonkulous.\nPenny: Yeah, well, this is all the donkulous you\u2019re gonna get.\nRaj: Okey dokey, let\u2019s roll. Alright, it\u2019s time to raise the roof. Oo-ooh, oo-ooh.\nPenny (to Leonard who is just coming up the stairs): Hey Leonard.\nLeonard: Hey.\nRaj: Dude.\nLeonard: You look very nice.\nRaj and Penny together: Thank you.\nPenny: Uh, come on, good night Leonard.\nLeonard: Good night.\nRaj: Hey, Leonard, did you see my limo downstairs.\nLeonard: Yeah.\nRaj: It\u2019s bigger than the house my grandfather grew up in.\nLeonard: Terrific.\nRaj: It has more food too.\nPenny: Alright, come on, come on.\nRaj (leaving, singing): I\u2019m coming up so you better get this party started.\nLeonard (entering apartment): Hey.\nHoward: Hey, good news, you don\u2019t have to sulk about Penny any more, look, there are hundreds of Croatian women just waiting for you to contact them.\nLeonard: Anythingforagreencard.com?\nHoward: I\u2019ll lend you my user name, it\u2019s wealthybigpenis.\nLeonard: You\u2019re joking.\nHoward: Well, you gotta make it easy for them, they\u2019re just learning English.\nLeonard: Pass.\nHoward: So you\u2019re just going to sit around here and mope while Penny is out with Doctor Apu from the Kwik-e-Mart?\nLeonard: It\u2019s not a date, and that\u2019s racist.\nHoward: It can\u2019t be racist, he\u2019s a beloved character on the Simpsons.\nLeonard: Let\u2019s just eat so I can get to bed. With any luck tonight will be the night my sleep apnoea kills me.\nSheldon: Did you remember to ask for the chicken with broccoli to be diced not shredded?\nLeonard: Yes.\nSheldon: Even though the menu description specifies shredded?\nLeonard: Yes.\nSheldon: Brown rice, not white?\nLeonard: Yes.\nSheldon: Did you stop at the Korean grocery and get the good hot mustard.\nLeonard: Yes.\nSheldon: Did you pick up the low sodium soy sauce from the market?\nLeonard: Yes.\nSheldon: Thank you.\nLeonard: You\u2019re welcome.\nSheldon: What took you so long?\nLeonard: Just sit down and eat.\nSheldon: Fine. (Opens carton. Shows it to Leonard in disgust.)\nLeonard: Alright, it\u2019s shredded, what do you want me to do?\nSheldon: I want you to check before you accept the order.\nLeonard: Sorry.\nSheldon: Were you distracted by the possibility that Koothrappali might have intercourse with Penny tonight?\nLeonard: He\u2019s not going to have intercourse with Penny.\nSheldon: Then there\u2019s no excuse for this chicken. You know, this situation with Koothrapali brings to mind a story from my childhood.\nHoward: Oh goody, more tales from the panhandle.\nSheldon: That\u2019s Northwest Texas, I\u2019m from East Texas, the Gulf region, home to many Vietnamese shrimpers.\nLeonard: Do the shrimpers feature in your story?\nSheldon: No. Anyway, when I was eight, a Montgomery-Ward delivery van ran over our cat, Lucky.\nHoward: Lucky?\nSheldon: Yes, Lucky.\nLeonard: He\u2019s irony impaired, just move on.\nHoward: Okay, dead cat named Lucky, continue.\nSheldon: While others mourned Lucky, I realised his untimely demise provided me with the opportunity to replace him with something more suited to my pet needs. A faithful companion that I could snuggle with at night, and yet would be capable of killing upon telepathic command.\nHoward: So, not a puppy?\nSheldon: Please, no, nothing so pedestrian. I wanted a griffin.\nLeonard: A griffin?\nSheldon: Yes, half eagle, half lion.\nLeonard: And mythological.\nSheldon: Irrelevant. See, I was studying recombinant DNA technology and I was confident I could create one, but my parents were unwilling to secure the necessary eagle eggs and lion semen. Course my sister got swimming lessons when she wanted them.\nHoward: Sheldon, not that we don\u2019t all enjoy a good lion semen story, what\u2019s your point.\nSheldon: My point is, if Koothrappali is moving on to a new life of shallow, undeserved fame, perhaps this is an opportunity to create a better cohort.\nLeonard: You want to breed a new friend?\nSheldon: That\u2019s one option, but who has the time? But consider this, the Japanese, they\u2019re doing some wonderful work with artificial intelligence, now, you combine that with some animatronics from the imagineers over at Disney, next thing you know, we\u2019re playing Halo with a multi-lingual Abraham Lincoln.\nHoward: Sheldon, don\u2019t take this the wrong way, but, you\u2019re insane.\nLeonard: That may well be, but the fact is, it wouldn\u2019t kill us to meet some new people.\nSheldon: Uh, for the record, it could kill us to meet new people. They could be murderers, or the carriers of unusual pathogens, and I\u2019m not insane, my mother had me tested.\nLeonard: If we do get a new friend, he should be a guy you can trust. A guy who has your back.\nHoward: And he should have a lot of money, and live in a cool place down by the beach where we could throw parties.\nSheldon: He should share our love of technology.\nHoward: And he should know a lot of women.\nLeonard: Yeah, let\u2019s see, money, women, technology, okay we\u2019re agreed, our new friend is going to be Iron Man.\nScene: Raj\u2019s apartment. Raj is heard singing in a drunk voice through the door. He enters with his arm around Penny.\nRaj: Welcome to the Raj Mahal.\nPenny: Yes, it\u2019s very nice, goodnight Raj.\nRaj: No, wait, the evening\u2019s not over.\nPenny: Yes it is.\nRaj: No, it\u2019s time to put on some R. Kelly and suck face.\nPenny: Oh, wow, is the evening over.\nRaj (as a ringing noise is heard): Wait, wait, that\u2019s my mummy and daddy calling from India. I want you to meet my parents.\nPenny: Wait, meet them.\nRaj (inhales deeply, picks up laptop, presses a button. His mother and father appear on the screen): Hello mummy and daddy, good to see you. I\u2019m not drunk.\nMrs Koothrappali: Why would you say that?\nRaj: Just making conversation. Mummy, daddy, I want you to meet my new squeeze, Penny.\nPenny: I am not your squeeze. There is no squeezing.\nDr Koothrappali: I can\u2019t see her, centre her in the frame.\nRaj: Here you go, cute huh?\nMrs Koothrappali: She\u2019s not Indian.\nDr Koothrappali: So, she\u2019s not Indian, the boy\u2019s just sowing some wild oats.\nPenny: No, no, there\u2019s no sowing, no squeezing, and no sucking face.\nMrs Koothrappali: What if he gets her pregnant. Is this little hotsy-totsy who you want as the mother of your grandchildren.\nRaj: What right do you have to pick who I can have children with?\nDr Koothrappali: Look, Rajesh, I understand, you\u2019re in America, you want to try the local cuisine. But trust me, you don\u2019t want it for a steady diet.\nRaj: Now you listen to me, I am no longer a child, and I will not be spoken to like one. Now if you\u2019d excuse me, I have to go throw up.\nMrs Koothrappali: What\u2019s wrong with him?\nPenny: I don\u2019t know, maybe it\u2019s the local cuisine. Okay, well, it\u2019s nice to meet you, just gonna set you on down over here, and I\u2019m going to leave so, Namaste. (Leaves, then almost immediately returns) And FYI, you\u2019d be lucky to have me as a daughter-in-law.\nDr Koothrappali: She\u2019s feisty. I like that.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment. She is in her bathrobe. A note slides under the door. \nPenny (opening door to find Raj outside): Raj, what are you doing. (He hands her the note). No. No notes. If you have something to say to me, say it.\nRaj (tries several times. Finally, in a high pitched squeak): Sorry.\nPenny: Oh, sweetie, it\u2019s okay. (She hugs him. As she does, Leonard exits his apartment to see Penny, in bathrobe, hugging Raj who is apparently about to leave. As she goes back inside, Raj turns, smiles, and puts both thumbs up. Leonard turns, with an upset look, to Sheldon who is standing behind him. Sheldon gives him his exaggerated smile.)\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "1_11": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The living room of the apartment. Leonard and Sheldon are playing the three dimensional chess game from the original Star Trek series. It is Leonard\u2019s move. He takes his time, moving round the board and checking things from various angles. Finally he tentatively makes a move. Sheldon moves almost immediately.\nSheldon: Checkmate.\nLeonard: O-o-o-o-h! Again?\nSheldon: Obviously you\u2019re not well suited for three-dimensional chess, perhaps three dimensional candyland would be more your speed. \nLeonard: Just reset the board.\nSheldon: It must be humbling to suck on so many different levels. \nPenny (knocking and entering): Hi guys.\nLeonard: Hey! \nPenny: Did you get my mail.\nLeonard: Yeah, right here. How was Nebraska?\nPenny: Oh, better than North Dakota! (Pause) I guess that joke\u2019s only funny in Nebraska.\nSheldon: From the data at hand you really can\u2019t draw that conclusion. All you can say with absolute certainty is that that joke is not funny here. \nPenny: Boy, it\u2019s good to be back. \nLeonard: How was your family?\nPenny: Ugh, it was the worst trip, everyone got sick over the weekend.\nSheldon: Sick? \nLeonard: Here we go. \nSheldon (running to opposite side of the room): What kind of sick?\nPenny: Oh, the flu I guess.\nSheldon: I don\u2019t need you to guess, I need you to know, now when did the symptoms first appear?\nPenny: Maybe Friday.\nSheldon: Friday, was that morning or afternoon? \nPenny: I\u2026 I don\u2019t\u2026\nSheldon: Think woman, who blew their nose and when? \nLeonard: Sheldon, relax, she doesn\u2019t have any symptoms, I\u2019m sure she\u2019s not contagious.\nSheldon: Oh please, if influenza was only contagious after symptoms appear it would have died out thousands of years ago. Somewhere between tool using and cave painting, homo habilus would have figured out to kill the guy with the runny nose. \nLeonard: Penny, you\u2019ll have to excuse Sheldon, he\u2019s a bit of a germophobe. \nPenny: Oh, it\u2019s okay, I understand.\nSheldon: Thanks for your consideration, now please leave.\nLeonard: You\u2019d better go before he starts spraying you with Lysol. \nPenny: Okay, well, thank you for getting my mail.\nLeonard: No problem. Welcome home. (Sees Penny out. Turns to find Sheldon spraying the air with Lysol.)\nSheldon: What?\nCredits sequence\nScene: The kitchen\nLeonard: What the hell are you doing?\nSheldon: I\u2019m making petrie dishes to grow throat cultures. \nLeonard: With lime jello?\nSheldon: I need a growth medium, and someone polished off the apricot yoghurt. Here, swab my throat.\nLeonard: I don\u2019t think so.\nSheldon: Leonard! If I\u2019m going to get ahead of this thing I need to find out what\u2019s growing in my throat. \nLeonard: Sheldon, you are not sick. This is, but you are not. \nSheldon: We have no idea what pathogen Typhoid Penny has introduced into our environment. And having never been to Nebraska I\u2019m fairly certain that I have no cornhusking antibodies. \nLeonard: Sheldon, don\u2019t you think you\u2019re overreacting? \nSheldon: When I\u2019m lying comatose in a hospital relying on inferior minds to cure me, these jello cultures and my accompanying notes will give them a fighting chance. \nLeonard: I\u2019m going back to bed. \nSheldon: Wait. (Handing him a measuring jug) Put this in the bathroom.\nLeonard: What for? \nSheldon: I need to measure my fluid intake and output to make sure my kidneys aren\u2019t shutting down.\nLeonard: I mix pancake batter in this! \nSheldon: No, that measuring cup has always been for urine.\nLeonard: You had time to make a label for everything in this apartment, including the label maker, but you didn\u2019t have ten seconds to make one that said urine cup? \nSheldon: It\u2019s right here on the bottom. \nLeonard: Huh. I guess I owe the Betty Crocker company a letter of apology. \nScene: Sheldon\u2019s bedroom. Sheldon wakes up and coughs. Picks up an electronic thermometer and takes his temperature.\nSheldon: Oh, dear God. (Shouting) Leonard! Leonard, I\u2019m sick!\nCut to Leonard entering living room in panic, stumbling and trying to put on a pair of trousers.\nSheldon (voice off): Leonard! Leonard I\u2019m sick!\nLeonard grabs jacket and leaves through front door.\nSheldon (entering, wrapped in duvet): Leonard! Leonard! Leonard. Leonard, my comforter fell down, and my sinuses hurt when I bend over. Leonard? (Bends to get phone) Ow! \nLeonard (voice on phone): Hey.\nSheldon: Leonard, where are you? \nLeonard (running down stairs): I\u2019m at work. \nSheldon: At six-thirty in the morning? \nLeonard: Yes.\nSheldon: On Sunday? \nLeonard: Yes.\nSheldon: Why? \nLeonard: They asked me to come in.\nSheldon: Well, I didn\u2019t hear the phone ring.\nLeonard: They texted me. \nSheldon: Well, as I predicted, I am sick. My fever has been tracking up exponentially since 2am, and I am producing sputum at an alarming rate. \nLeonard: No kidding?\nSheldon: No. Not only that, it has shifted from clear to milky green. \nLeonard: Alright, well, get some rest and drink plenty of fluids. \nSheldon: What else would I drink? Gasses? Solids? Ionised plasma?\nLeonard: Drink whatever you want.\nSheldon: I want soup.\nLeonard: Then make soup. \nSheldon: We don\u2019t have soup. \nLeonard: I\u2019m at work, Sheldon. (A woman enters the apartment building with a barking dog.) \nSheldon: Is that a dog?\nLeonard: Yes, \nSheldon: In the lab?\nLeonard: Yes, they\u2019re training dogs to operate the centrifuge for when they need dogs to operate the centrifuge for blind scientists, I have to go. \nScene: Howard\u2019s bedroom. The phone is ringing.\nHoward\u2019s Mother (voice): Howard, it\u2019s the phone.\nHoward: I know it\u2019s the phone, Ma, I hear the phone.\nHoward\u2019s Mother: Well who\u2019s calling at this ungodly hour? \nHoward: I don\u2019t know.\nHoward\u2019s Mother: Well ask them why they\u2019re calling at this ungodly hour. \nHoward: How can I ask them when I\u2019m talking to you! (Into phone) Hello.\nLeonard: Howard, it\u2019s Leonard, code Milky Green. \nHoward: Dear Lord, not Milky Green! \nLeonard: Affirmative, with fever.\nHoward\u2019s Mother: Who\u2019s on the phone.\nHoward: It\u2019s Leonard.\nHoward\u2019s Mother: Why is he calling.\nHoward: Sheldon\u2019s sick.\nHoward\u2019s Mother: Were you playing with him? \nHoward: For God\u2019s sake, Ma, I\u2019m twenty six years old.\nHoward\u2019s Mother: Excuse me Mr Grown-up. Whadda-ya want for breakfast.\nHoward: Chocolate milk and eggoes please! \nLeonard: Howard, listen to me.\nHoward: Hang on, call waiting.\nLeonard (voice): No, don\u2019t, don\u2019t\u2026.\nHoward: Hello.\nSheldon: Howard, I\u2019m sick. \nHoward (imitating his mother\u2019s voice): Howard\u2019s sleeping, this is his mother. Why are you calling at this ungodly hour? \nSheldon: I need soup.\nHoward: Then call your own mother. (To Leonard) It was Sheldon.\nLeonard: I tried to stop you. \nHoward: It\u2019s my own fault, I forgot the protocol we put in place after the great ear infection of \u201906. \nLeonard: You call Koothrappali, we need to find a place to lay low for the next eighteen to twenty four hours. \nHoward: Stand by. Ma, can my friends come over?\nHoward\u2019s Mother: I just had the carpets steamed. \nHoward: That\u2019s a negatory. But there\u2019s a Planet of the Apes marathon at the New Art today. \nLeonard: Five movies, two hours apiece. It\u2019s a start. \nScene: The Cheesecake Factory.\nWaitress: Homeless crazy guy at table eighteen. \nPenny: No, just crazy. Sheldon, what are you doing here?\nSheldon: I\u2019m sick, thank you very much. \nPenny: How could you have gotten it from me, I\u2019m not sick.\nSheldon: You\u2019re a carrier. All these people here are doomed. You\u2019re doomed! \nPenny: Shhh! Sheldon, what do you want.\nSheldon: I want soup.\nPenny (over Sheldon\u2019s strange throat clearance): Why didn\u2019t you just\u2026. (louder throat clearance) Why didn\u2019t you just have soup at home. \nSheldon: Penny, I have an IQ of 187, don\u2019t you imagine that if there were a way for me to have had soup at home I would have thought of it?\nPenny: You can have soup delivered.\nSheldon: I did not think of that. Clearly febrile delirium is setting in, please bring me some soup while I still understand what a spoon is for. \nPenny: Okay, what kind of soup do you want.\nSheldon: Well, my mother used to make me this split pea with little frankfurter slices and these home made croutons.\nPenny: We have Chicken Tortilla and Potato Leek. \nSheldon: Can I get any of those with little frankfurter slices and home made croutons?\nPenny: No.\nSheldon: Then surprise me. (Blows nose into handkerchief. Shows it to next table) Would you call that moss green or forest green? \nScene: The cinema. Everyone is wearing ape masks. \nHoward: Look at this, everyone went chimp. \nRaj: Well I\u2019d like to point out, I voted for orang-utan, but you shouted me down. (Phone rings).\nLeonard: Oh, hi Penny!\nPenny: Hey, where are you? \nLeonard: I\u2019m\u2026 uh\u2026 at work.\nPenny: You sound funny.\nLeonard: I\u2019m\u2026 uh\u2026 in a\u2026 I\u2019m in a radiation suit. What\u2019s up?\nPenny: Yeah, well I\u2019m at work too, and you\u2019ll never guess who\u2019s here infecting my entire station. \nLeonard (To Howard and Raj): Sheldon\u2019s at the Cheesecake Factory. (Into phone) Just tell him to go home. \nPenny: He won\u2019t leave, he says he\u2019s afraid he\u2019ll pass out on the bus and someone will harvest his organs.\n Leonard (To Howard and Raj): He\u2019s paranoid, and he\u2019s established a nest. \nPenny: Can you please come get him? \nLeonard: Uh, yeah, I\u2019d be\u2026 I\u2019d be happy to Penny. (Holds phone up, Howard makes warning siren noises) Oh my God there\u2019s a breech in the radiation unit (Raj joins in) The whole city is in jeopardy, oh my God, Professor Googenfeil is melting, gotta go, bye! (To Howard and Raj) I feel really guilty. \nRaj: You did what you had to do. (Steals some of Howard\u2019s popcorn)\nHoward: Take your stinking paws off my popcorn you damn dirty ape. \nScene: The stairwell.\nSheldon: Thanks for bringing me home. \nPenny: Oh, it\u2019s okay, I didn\u2019t really need to work today, it\u2019s not like I have rent or car payments or anything.\nSheldon: Good. Good.\nPenny: Okay, well, you feel better.\nSheldon: Wait, where are you going? \nPenny: Um, home, to write some bad cheques.\nSheldon: You\u2019re going to leave me? \nPenny: Sheldon, you are a grown man, haven\u2019t you ever been sick before? \nSheldon: Well, of course, but, not by myself. \nPenny: Really, never?\nSheldon: Well, once. When I was fifteen, and spending the summer at the Heidelberg Institute in Germany.\nPenny: Studying abroad?\nSheldon: No, visiting professor. Anyway, the local cuisine was a little more sausage-based than I\u2019m used to, and the result was an internal blitzkrieg with my lower intestine playing the part of Czechoslovakia. \nPenny: And there was no-one there to take care of you?\nSheldon: No. No, my mum had to fly back to Texas to help my dad because the house had slipped off the cinderblocks again. \nPenny: Again?\nSheldon: It was tornado season. And it was an aluminium house. Anyway, the housekeeper in the faculty residence didn\u2019t speak any English, when I finally managed to convince her I was sick, she said \u201cM\u00f6chtest Du eine Darmsp\u00fclung?\u201d\nPenny: What does that mean?\nSheldon: Based on what happened next, I assume it means \u201cwould you like an enema?\u201d\nPenny: Okay, sweetie, I\u2019ll take care of you, what do you need?\nSheldon: Well, my mom used to give me sponge baths. \nPenny: Okay, ground rules, no sponge baths, and definitely no enemas. \nSheldon: Agreed. \nScene: The cinema. \nRaj: Here we go, ten and a half hours of apey goodness. \nLeonard: Oh dammit, my glasses. Okay, I\u2019m blind here guys, can you help me find them?\nHoward: Sorry. (Crunching sound) Found \u2018em. \nLeonard: Oh great.\nHoward: Sorry, don\u2019t you have a spare.\nLeonard: Yeah, at home. \nRaj: Well if you leave now, you can be back before the gorillas rip the crap out of Charlton Heston. \nHoward: Unless Sheldon\u2019s there, in which case you\u2019ll be trapped forever in his whiny hyper neurotic snot-web. \nLeonard (Dials phone): Hi, Penny. I was wondering, is Sheldon still at the restaurant? Okay, that was very nice of you. Okay, gotta go, got kind of a full blown Chernobyl thing here, gotta go, bye. (To Howard) He\u2019s home, I\u2019m screwed. Ten and a half hours of apey blurriness. \nRaj: How about Lasic? \nLeonard: You want me to get eye surgery? \nRaj: Would you rather go back to the apartment and deal with Sheldon, or have a stranger carve out your corneas with a laser beam?\nHoward: Well?\nLeonard: I\u2019m thinking! \nScene: Sheldon\u2019s bedroom.\nPenny: Okay, nice and cosy, okay, I\u2019ll see you later.\nSheldon: Wait. Will you please rub this on my chest. \nPenny: Oh, Sheldon, can\u2019t you do that yourself?\nSheldon: Vaporub makes my hands smell funny. \nPenny: But Sheldon\u2026.\nSheldon: Please, please, please, please, please, please, please.\nPenny: I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m doing this. \nSheldon: No, no, counter-clockwise or my chest hair mats. \nPenny: Sorry. \nSheldon: Can you sing \u201cSoft Kitty\u201d. \nPenny: What?\nSheldon: My mom used to sing it to me when I was sick.\nPenny: I\u2019m sorry, honey, I don\u2019t know it.\nSheldon: I\u2019ll teach you. \u201cSoft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur, happy kitty, sleepy kitty, purr purr purr.\u201d Now you. \nPenny (after a loud sigh): Soft kitty, warm kitty\u2026\nSheldon: Little ball of fur. Keep rubbing. \nPenny (through gritted teeth): Little ball of fur. \nScene: The living room door, a fibre-optic camera emerges from underneath. We see the scene from its point of view. Cut to outside. Raj is holding a laptop, Howard is feeding the camera under the door. \nLeonard: What do you see, what do you see.\nRaj: The living room appears to be empty. \nLeonard: Okay, he must be in his bedroom. My spare glasses are in my bedroom, on my dresser, next to my Bat-signal. \nHoward: I\u2019m not going in there.\nLeonard: Raj?\nRaj: No way, Jose. \nLeonard: Well I can\u2019t do it, I can\u2019t see anything. \nHoward: It\u2019s all right, wireless mini-cam and Bluetooth headset. We\u2019ll be your eyes. \nLeonard: Fine.\nHoward: One more thing. This is a subsonic impact sensor. If Sheldon gets out of bed and starts to walk, this device will register it and send a signal to the laptop. At that point, based on the geography of the apartment and the ambulatory speed of a sick Sheldon, you\u2019ll have seven seconds to get out, glasses or no glasses.\nLeonard: Won\u2019t my footsteps set it off? \nHoward: No, you\u2019ll be on your hands and knees. Now you\u2019ll need to get the sensor as close as you can to Sheldon\u2019s room. \nLeonard: Well, how do I carry it if I\u2019m on my hands and knees?\nCut to Leonard entering apartment on hands and knees, carrying the sensor in his teeth. \nHoward: Stay low. Bear left. Now keep true.\nLeonard: What? \nHoward: It means go straight.\nLeonard: Then just say go straight. \nHoward: You don\u2019t stay go straight when you\u2019re giving bearings, you say keep true. \nLeonard: Alright (Bangs head on a trunk.) I just hit my head. \nHoward: Because you didn\u2019t keep true. (Time shift, Leonard is now outside bedrooms) Okay, turn right. \nRaj: The\u2026 the picture\u2019s breaking up. \nHoward: Angle your head to the right. A little more. A little more. (Leonard now has his head at right angles to his body) That\u2019s it, now just keep true. Alright, you\u2019re close enough to Sheldon\u2019s room, deploy the sensor. Now turn it on.\nLeonard: It wasn\u2019t on? \nHoward: No.\nLeonard: Then why did I have to crawl? \nHoward: Oh, I guess you didn\u2019t. \nLeonard: Okay, it\u2019s on.\nHoward: Good. From this point forward you will have to crawl. \nLeonard: I know. \nHoward: Hang on, the sensor\u2019s picking up something, turn your head back. (Camera angle shows a pair of female legs.) \nPenny: You rat bastard. \nHoward (running down stairs with Raj): Told you the sensor would work. \nLeonard: Hi!\nPenny: You deliberately stuck me with Sheldon. \nLeonard: Well, I had to, you see what he\u2019s like. \nSheldon (off): Penny! Penny, I\u2019m hungry. \nPenny: Uh, it\u2019s okay, sweetie, good news, Leonard\u2019s home!\nLeonard: No! \nPenny (handing him vaporub): Here you go, good luck, bye.\nLeonard: W-wait! \nSheldon: Leonard, I\u2019m hungry!\nLeonard: Wait! Penny! Take me with you! (Runs after her and bumps into pillar. Falls semi-conscious to the floor. \u00a0Sheldon appears in his comforter.) \nSheldon: I want grilled cheese. \nTime shift. Sheldon and Leonard are on the sofa. Sheldon is wrapped in his comforter, Leonard is holding an ice-pack to his head. \nSheldon: Do you think Penny will come here and take care of us? \nLeonard: I don\u2019t think Penny\u2019s ever coming here again. \nSheldon: I\u2019m very congested. \nLeonard: Yeah, so?\nSheldon: Can you go to the kitchen, and get me the turkey baster labelled mucus.\nLeonard: If I stand, I\u2019ll vomit. \nSheldon: Under the sink, yellow Tupperware bowl. \nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "9_6": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: Leonard\u2019s lab.\nSheldon: Leonard, I\u2019ve got terrible news.\nLeonard: What\u2019s going on?\nSheldon: Before I tell you, perhaps I should soften the blow. You\u2019re face is pleasingly symmetrical.\nLeonard: Just tell me.\nSheldon: A Swedish team of physicists is trying to scoop our super-fluid vortex experiment.\nLeonard: Oh, well, that kind of stinks.\nSheldon: That kind of stinks? Why aren\u2019t you more upset? Did I soften the blow too much? Because this here is more like a Picasso painting.\nLeonard: What are we going to do?\nSheldon: Perform the experiment immediately.\nLeonard: I\u2019d love to, but we need liquid helium and our shipment\u2019s on back order for a month.\nSheldon: A month? What? Are you kidding me? That would have been a good time for you to soften the blow.\nLeonard: That shirt brings out the blue in your eyes.\nSheldon: Thank you. Aren\u2019t you sweet.\nLeonard: Let\u2019s go check to see if the university has any helium in reserve.\nSheldon: Did you know that I almost didn\u2019t wear this shirt today?\nScene: Barry Kripke\u2019s office.\nLeonard: Hey, Barry, we\u2019re in trouble. We need liquid helium, does the department have any we can use?\nBarry: Sowwy, there\u2019s a showtage. And what we do have I need for my quantum excitation study.\nSheldon: But you won\u2019t need much for that.\nBarry: Twue, but if it\u2019s successful, I\u2019m having a pawty with bawwoons.\nLeonard: Come on, Barry, there\u2019s a Swedish team trying to run our experiment before us. Can\u2019t you spare any?\nBarry: Be honest, if the shoe was on the other foot, would you do this for me?\nLeonard: Yes.\nSheldon: Not a chance.\nLeonard: What are you doing?\nSheldon: He said be honest, so I was honest. Didn\u2019t your mother tell you? It\u2019s the best policy. So, what do you say?\nBarry: Hell no.\nSheldon: He could\u2019ve softened the blow.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: Leonard\u2019s lab.\nRaj: Why do you need Kripke? Can\u2019t you just go to Party City for helium?\nLeonard: We\u2019d have to go to every Party City in California.\nHoward: Sounds like you on Cinco de Mayo.\nRaj: Hey, people were still talking about that party on siete de Mayo.\nSheldon: Leonard, if that Swedish team beats us, I will never be able to enjoy anything from their country again. Which is a shame, because Swedish meatballs are my favourite toothpick-delivered meatball.\nHoward: If you need liquid helium so bad, I know a guy who can get you some, if you don\u2019t ask too many questions.\nLeonard: Who is he?\nSheldon: Where does he work?\nLeonard: How does he get the helium?\nSheldon: How many questions are too many questions?\nHoward: Maybe he\u2019s not for you.\nSheldon: Four questions. There answer\u2019s four.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s house.\nBernadette: Hey, you know who went out on a date the other night? Stuart.\nPenny: Oh, good for him.\nBernadette: I thought so, too.\nPenny: So is she, like, homeless, or framing him for a crime?\nBernadette: He\u2019s using some kind of dating app on his phone.\nPenny: Oh, which one? Maybe we can get Amy to try it.\nBernadette: I don\u2019t know. Stuart, can you come in here? He tried to explain it to me. It shows you pictures of people nearby, you swipe them around, it looks kind of like a game.\nPenny: Oh, and if you lose the game, you have to go out with Stuart.\nStuart: What\u2019s up?\nBernadette: Can you show us that dating app?\nStuart: Oh, yeah, sure. This thing has changed my life.\nPenny: Wow. So how many girls have you met?\nStuart: Two. I probably don\u2019t need to mention there\u2019s an entire number between that and zero.\nPenny: Well, so how does it work?\nStuart: Uh, well, it, it shows me all the single women in a five-mile radius who are using the app. If I like the way they look I hit thumbs up, if I don\u2019t, thumbs down.\nBernadette: Oh, what would make you give a girl a thumbs down?\nStuart: First time it happens I will let you know.\nScene: The apartment. \nLeonard: Oh, hey. I just heard back from the liquid helium guy.\nSheldon: What\u2019s he say?\nLeonard: He\u2019s got what we need and can meet us tonight.\nSheldon: Really? You know I don\u2019t like buying things at night. January 7th, 2009, I went to the Ralph\u2019s at 11:30pm to pick up Cracklin\u2019 Oat Bran for the morning and what did I see?\nLeonard: The man restocking the cereal shelves.\nSheldon: That\u2019s right. And what did he do?\nLeonard: He handed you the box directly and called you Stretch.\nSheldon: It\u2019s like it was yesterday.\nLeonard: Do you want liquid helium or not?\nSheldon: Of course I do. I don\u2019t want that Swedish team scooping us.\nLeonard: Then I\u2019m going to tell him we\u2019re in.\nSheldon: Leonard, wait. This is highly unethical.\nLeonard: We\u2019re just bending the rules a little. We have grant money to do the experiment, so we\u2019re going to spend it on the helium we need. It\u2019s not like when Dr. Goldfarb claimed he bought an electron microscope and he was really just keeping a Russian girl in an apartment in Van Nuys.\nSheldon: Was she helping him with his research?\nLeonard: Sure. So, are we doing this?\nSheldon: Well, but where does he get the helium?\nLeonard: Remember? Don\u2019t ask too many questions?\nSheldon: Uh, but this is violating university code.\nLeonard: A little, but if I may quote Einstein, the pursuit of science calls us to ignore the rules set by man.\nSheldon: Huh. All right, do it. Tell him we\u2019re in.\nLeonard: Done.\nSheldon: I can\u2019t find that quote on the Internet. Did you make that up?\nLeonard: Before I answer, may I just say your skin has never looked better.\nSheldon: Aren\u2019t you just made of sugar.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s house.\nAmy: I\u2019m not sure how I feel about this.\nPenny: Oh, come on, just let him put the app on your phone.\nBernadette: Yeah, Stuart got two dates with it.\nStuart: One of which would\u2019ve ended in sex had she not said no. Okay, all set.\nPenny: Okay, let me see. Nope, nope, nope, oh, he\u2019s cute.\nBernadette: Doesn\u2019t a teardrop tattoo mean he murdered someone?\nPenny: And he\u2019s sad about it.\nHoward: Hey.\nRaj: Hello.\nPenny: Hey.\nBernadette: Hey, I thought you were gonna be out late?\nHoward: If you wanted me to stay out later, you should\u2019ve given me more spending money.\nRaj: What are you guys up to?\nBernadette: We put Amy on a dating app, and we\u2019re seeing what\u2019s out there.\nRaj: Oh, fun. Let me see. Uh, no, no, uh, definitely not.\nHoward: What was wrong with that guy?\nRaj: Uh, he\u2019s Indian. We\u2019ve already got one of those. Ooh, we should find a nice Latino, really round us out.\nHoward: Hey, I want to try.\nAmy: Uh, excuse me, can I have my phone back?\nHoward: Hang on, I\u2019m trying to find you the next great love of your life. The man who will father your children. Okay, yes or no on white guy with dreadlocks?\nScene: A parking garage.\nLeonard: That must be him.\nSheldon: Oh, of course. An nondescript, white panel van. You may be familiar with it from the sentence, their bodies were found in a nondescript, white panel van.\nLeonard: Hey.\nMan: What\u2019s up?\nLeonard: Uh, I\u2019m Leonard. This is my friend\u2026\nSheldon: I\u2019m Skippy. Skippy Cavanaugh.\nMan: Great. You got the cash?\nLeonard: Uh, yeah, uh, right here.\nSheldon: Wait, hold on, hold on. How do we know that you\u2019re not gonna take the money and drive away?\nLeonard: What ya doing, Skippy?\nSheldon: Exactly what 1970s television crime dramas have taught us. You give us the helium first.\nMan: Oh, how do I know you\u2019re not gonna drive away without paying me?\nSheldon: Guess I\u2019m not the only one who watches \u201970s television crime dramas.\nLeonard: Look, you can trust us. We\u2019re respected scientists.\nSheldon: Well, he is. I\u2019m a wedding planner who can\u2019t find love himself. It\u2019s ironic, but the point is we can\u2019t trust you. You\u2019re a sketchy character in a parking garage.\nMan: Yeah, well, from my perspective, that\u2019s how you two appear to me.\nSheldon: Well, I never thought of it like that. Boy, frame of reference will just sneak up on you, won\u2019t it?\nLeonard: My friend does make a decent point about the money. I don\u2019t feel comfortable just handing it over up front.\nMan: Ah, no money, no helium. Seems we\u2019re at a, uh, stalemate.\nSheldon: Not technically. In chess, a stalemate refers to a situation in which there are no remaining moves. Uh, you have plenty of moves available. You could beat us up and steal the money. You could kill us, you know. Really, you\u2019re only limited by your imagination.\nMan: Huh. All these years I\u2019ve been using stalemate, when I really mean impasse. I feel foolish.\nLeonard: I don\u2019t think it matters if this is a stalemate or an impasse or a Mexican standoff. What are we gonna do here?\nMan: Oh, whoa, whoa, how can it bea Mexican standoff? Everybody knows you need three sides for that.\nSheldon: Not necessarily. Uh, many argue the essence of a Mexican standoff is that no one can walk away from the conflict without incurring harm.\nMan: Hmm, I don\u2019t follow.\nSheldon: Let me give you an example. Earlier today, I decoded the headers on your e-mail, and I know that your name is Kenneth Fitzgerald. From that, I figured out where you live and where you work. Now, to make this a Mexican standoff, I would say something like, uh, you give us the helium or I\u2019ll turn you in to the authorities.\nMan: Is that a threat?\nSheldon: Yeah, exactly. See, you\u2019re getting it.\nMan: Yeah, well, I know where you work, all right? And if you mess with me, I\u2019ll report you, then I\u2019ll pound your asses into the ground.\nSheldon: Perfect. Now we really are in a Mexican standoff. Is this one of those times where I\u2019ve won the battle but lost the war?\nLeonard: Afraid so, Skippy.\nSheldon: I told you we shouldn\u2019t go shopping at night.\nLeonard: All right, let\u2019s all just calm down. Nobody wants to report anybody.\nMan: No, I don\u2019t like this. I\u2019m out.\nLeonard: No, no, no. Wait, don\u2019t go. Just let me explain. We\u2019re physicists, and we\u2019re trying to prove a hypothesis that we\u2019ve been working on for over a year.\nMan: Really? What\u2019s the hypothesis?\nSheldon: Space-time can be interpreted as the surface of an n-dimensional superfluid.\nMan: Hmm. Could be, could be. Go on.\nLeonard: Okay, but now there\u2019s this Swedish team that read our paper and they\u2019re trying to beat us to our own discovery. We really need this helium.\nSheldon: And I\u2019m sorry I lied about being a wedding planner who can\u2019t find love. Although I am currently single, if you know anybody.\nLeonard: Here\u2019s the money. Can we do this?\nMan: Okay. It\u2019s a shame about those scientists ripping you off. I expected a higher ethical standard from our friends in Sweden.\nLeonard: It\u2019s actually pretty common in our field. There\u2019s not much you can do about it.\nMan: Well, for the right amount of money, if you know where they live, there\u2019s, uh, plenty we could do about it.\nSheldon: Did you hear that, Leonard? There\u2019s plenty we could do about it. Do you have a card?\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s house.\nPenny: Okay, here we go. Now everyone can see. All right. Where do we stand on cross-eyed Mike?\nRaj: You know he won\u2019t be looking at other girls.\nHoward: Unless they\u2019re sitting on the end of his nose.\nPenny: Okay, okay, okay. Thumbs down. Next.\nBernadette: Ew, check out his tiny teeth. He looks like a man-dolphin.\nPenny: Well if he\u2019s good in bed, she can throw him a fish.\nHoward: I love you, Amy. (Dolphin noises)\nAmy: Okay, I\u2019m starting to feel guilty. Aren\u2019t we being a little mean?\nRaj: That\u2019s a fair point. We wouldn\u2019t make fun of someone like this to their face.\nPenny: Look, it\u2019s Stuart.\nRaj: You may want to leave the room.\nScene: Leonard\u2019s lab.\nSheldon: Right this way, Uncle Harvey.\nLeonard: Will you stop with that already?\nSheldon: I\u2019m trying not to attract attention.\nLeonard: And tipping his hat to the cleaning lady didn\u2019t do that?\nSheldon: She said buenas noches. What was he supposed to do?\nLeonard: Let\u2019s just start the experiment.\nSheldon: Leonard, we should probably have our story straight in case we get caught.\nLeonard: We\u2019re not getting caught.\nSheldon: Well, you can\u2019t be sure of that. What if the helium dealer rats us out? What if Kripke asks where we got it? What if the university checks my family tree and finds out I don\u2019t have an Uncle Harvey?\nLeonard: The dealer doesn\u2019t care, Kripke has no authority over us, and you being related to a metal container would explain a lot. Help me hook this up.\nSheldon: Uh-oh.\nLeonard: What?\nSheldon: Well, did you see this sticker?\nLeonard: What is it?\nSheldon: It\u2019s partially torn off, but the segment that remains reads property of and the letter U.\nLeonard: It\u2019s probably USC or UCLA.\nSheldon: Yeah, but what if it\u2019s Property of U.S. Government? There\u2019s a national helium reserve in Amarillo, Texas. If this was stolen from there, we\u2019re accessories to a federal crime.\nLeonard: Let\u2019s not jump to conclusions. A lot of things start with U.\nSheldon: That\u2019s true. There\u2019s the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Department of Defence, U.S. Navy, you and I are going to jail.\nLeonard: Listen, we can do the experiment as planned and beat the Swedish team to the punch, or we can kiss our dreams good-bye because we were to afraid to break a few rules.\nScene: A university corridor.\nLeonard: Ma\u2019am.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s house.\nPenny: Okay, does everyone remember the rules? If he\u2019s shirtless, one sip. Posing with a pet, two sips. Pet and shirtless, chug like it\u2019s your job. And pull.\nRaj: I have that same underwear.\nPenny: Chug.\nPenny: Amy, you\u2019re getting a text.\nAmy: Oh, um, give me that.\nRaj: I had a great time last night.\nAmy: No, no, stop reading that.\nHoward: Who\u2019s Dave?\nPenny: You went on a date last night? Are you seeing someone?\nAmy: No, it, it\u2019s not like that.\nBernadette: And I\u2019d love to take you out again\u201d?\nAll: Amy/What?/Can\u2019t believe it/Oh, my God.\nAmy: Okay, it\u2019s like that.\nScene: The parking garage.\nLeonard: Thank you for coming back.\nMan: Yeah, well, normally I wouldn\u2019t, but my daughter\u2019s having a sleepover, and there\u2019s only so much screaming and Katy Perry a man can take.\nSheldon: Anyway, if you could just give us our money back, you can have your helium and we\u2019ll be on our way.\nMan: Yeah, well, is there something wrong with it?\nLeonard: No, nothing. We just changed our mind.\nSheldon: He has glasses and I\u2019m a know-it-all, we are not built for prison.\nMan: Yeah, I hear you. Well, you\u2019re good guys, so I\u2019ll, uh, I\u2019ll take the helium off your hands.\nLeonard: Thank you.\nMan: But you ain\u2019t getting your money back.\nSheldon: You\u2019re taking advantage of us? We clarified nomenclature together.\nMan: Look, I enjoy semantic digressions as much as the next guy, but, uh, this is business.\nLeonard: You know what? It\u2019s fine. Keep the money. We just want to be done with this.\nMan: No problem, but I am gonna have to charge you a small helium restocking fee.\nSheldon: I don\u2019t understand.\nLeonard: He wants more money.\nSheldon: Well, it better not be more than a thousand dollars. That\u2019s all I\u2019ve got on me.\nMan: That\u2019s exactly how much it is.\nSheldon: Finally, something breaks our way.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s house.\nPenny: I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re seeing someone and we don\u2019t even know about it.\nBernadette: Yeah, why wouldn\u2019t you tell us?\nAmy: Because it\u2019s new and weird and I\u2019m just trying to figure it all out. And I knew if I told you guys I had been out with a few people that you\u2019d get way too excited about it.\nStuart: A few people?\nBernadette: What?\nPenny: Amy.\nStuart: So, are we allowed to ask how it\u2019s going?\nAmy: It\u2019s going fine. It\u2019s mostly just been meeting people for coffee.\nRaj: What? I thought we were all\u2026 never mind.\nBernadette: I, I thought you weren\u2019t ready to start seeing people.\nAmy: Well, I don\u2019t have much experience dating, so I decided it would be good for me to, you know, get out there a little.\nPenny: Well, good for you.\nAmy: Thank you.\nBernadette: And how many guys have you gone out with?\nStuart: Please be less than two.\nAmy: Three.\nStuart: Damn it.\nScene: Leonard\u2019s lab. \nSheldon: Well, the Swedes might beat us, but at least we won\u2019t get gang-noogied in prison.\nLeonard: Is Ernest Goes to Jail the only prison movie you\u2019ve seen?\nSheldon: It scared me straight, Leonard.\nBarry: Hey, I\u2019ve been thinking. I was being petty. You can have my hewium.\nLeonard: Thank you, Barry.\nBarry: But you have to add my name to your paper.\nSheldon: That\u2019s preposterous.\nBarry: I don\u2019t know, seems fair. You can\u2019t do it without me.\nLeonard: Can you give us a minute?\nBarry: Take your time. I\u2019ll walk out backwards for dwamatic effect.\nSheldon: I don\u2019t like being extorted like this. Especially by him of all people.\nLeonard: Me neither, but what other choice do we have?\nScene: The parking garage.\nLeonard: I promise this is the last time.\nScene: The apartment. \nLeonard: It says right here on Wikipedia. A Mexican standoff is a confrontation between at least three parties.\nSheldon: How can you trust Wikipedia if they use between to refer to three parties?\nHelium Man: They should\u2019ve used among, right?\nSheldon: Or amongst, if they were feeling whimsically archaic.\nHelium Man: All right, enough with the chitchat. Are we gonna watch Ernest Goes to Jail or not?\nSheldon: Absolutely. But don\u2019t be surprised if this movie sets you on the straight and narrow.\nHelium Man: I am open to change.\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "8_9": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The apartment. \nAmy: This is an easy one.

Now think, there\u2019s a car named after him.\nSheldon: Of course there is. The Mini Cooper, \u2019cause it\u2019s me.\nAmy: How about this, he\u2019s a poor man\u2019s Sheldon Cooper.\nSheldon: Oh, Tesla.\nPenny: Hi.\nAmy: Hello.\nSheldon: Hey, how did it go?\nLeonard: Oh, not fun. The doctor shoved a camera up into my sinuses.\nPenny: Yeah, I watched. It was like the scary boat tunnel in Willy Wonka.\nAmy: Did they figure out what\u2019s wrong?\nLeonard: Yeah. It\u2019s a deviated septum. The surgery to correct it is simple. He\u2019s gonna do it next week.\nSheldon: Why would you have surgery?\nLeonard: Because I can\u2019t breathe. I snore, I get sinus infections.\nPenny: Yeah, back off, he\u2019s all mine.\nSheldon: But you don\u2019t have a life-threatening condition. Why would you take the risk of surgery?\nAmy: Sheldon, it\u2019s a routine procedure, I\u2019ve heard you complain about his snoring.\nSheldon: Yes, for the first five or six years, but I\u2019ve gotten used to it. It helps me sleep. He\u2019s like my mucus-powered white noise machine.\nLeonard: Sheldon, I\u2019m gonna get the surgery, it\u2019s no big deal. End of story.\nSheldon: Very well. I\u2019m done talking about it.\nLeonard: Thank you.\nSheldon: I believe it was your turn in the game.\nAmy: Okay.\nSheldon: Let\u2019s see. Oh, this person is most famous for never having gotten his nose mutilated with elective surgery and never living the rest of his life in the shadows as a hideous, disfigured freak.\nLeonard: I think you could give a better clue.\nSheldon: I don\u2019t.

I\u2019m wondering how I\u2019ll ever sleep without it.\nLeonard: If it helps you sleep, then why are you sitting here staring at me like the albino boogeyman?\nSheldon: Really Leonard. Insults? After I spent two hours in your closet, waiting for you to fall asleep?\nLeonard: What\u2019s your problem?\nSheldon: If the surgery is successful, the snoring is gone. And if you die during surgery, the snoring is gone.\nLeonard: It sounds like either way, I finally get some rest.\nSheldon: I have to be honest with you Leonard, I\u2019m truly worried.\nLeonard: I told you, there\u2019s nothing to worry about.\nSheldon: Well, I\u2019ve been doing some research and I\u2019ve learned that one in 700,000 people die from general anaesthesia.\nLeonard: Buddy, wh, do you realize that that also means 699,999 people don\u2019t die?\nSheldon: I suppose that\u2019s true. You\u2019re such a glass half-full kind of guy. I\u2019m going to miss that.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s apartment.\nRaj: Oh, so, my, uh, parents\u2019 40th anniversary\u2019s coming up and I can\u2019t think of a thing to get them.\nHoward: Damn, can you imagine being married to someone for 40 years?\nBernadette: Not anymore.\nRaj: Anyway, any ideas on a gift?\nBernadette: Well, what are some of the things they like?\nRaj: They used to like going to the Mumbai Symphony, but last year my mom thought they were phoning it in. Then my dad said based on their love life, she should know about phoning it in.\nBernadette: He said that to her?\nRaj: Well, they weren\u2019t speaking at the time, so he had a servant say it to her. Oh, maybe I could make a gift for them. I know how much you guys love the coasters I made for you.\nBernadette: They\u2019re yours in the divorce.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: Hey. What\u2019re you working on?\nSheldon: Remember when I said if you went through with your surgery, there was a one-in-700,000 chance of dying?\nLeonard: Yeah?\nSheldon: Well, I\u2019ve been crunching the numbers, and so far, I\u2019ve gotten your probability of death all the way to a sphincter-tightening one in 300.\nLeonard: Great timing. My check sphincter light just went on.\nSheldon: Leonard, what if you have an allergic reaction to the surgeon\u2019s latex gloves?\nLeonard: I\u2019m not allergic to latex.\nSheldon: Well, then why don\u2019t you wear the rubber gloves I bought for you to do the dishes?\nLeonard: For the same reason I don\u2019t wear the apron or the hair net.\nSheldon: Fine. What about epilepsy?\nLeonard: I don\u2019t have epilepsy, either.\nSheldon: You don\u2019t, but the surgeon might, hmm? And your carotid artery is just one shaky scalpel away from becoming the dancing fountain at Disneyland.\nLeonard: Sheldon, do you realize that driving is riskier than surgery?\nSheldon: I do. I have the drive to the hospital right here. That is if you make it to the car without falling down the stairs. And don\u2019t expect me to carry you, I do that enough in life.\nLeonard: Buddy, I, I get that you\u2019re worried about me and I, I appreciate that, but I\u2019m not going to die.\nSheldon: You don\u2019t know that.\nLeonard: Well, I do know that it won\u2019t be from an asteroid strike.\nSheldon: You know who else said that? Every cocky T. Rex currently swimming around in the gas tank of your car.\nLeonard: If there was an asteroid strike, wouldn\u2019t you die, too?\nSheldon: I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m smart and scrappy, I think I\u2019d find a way.\nLeonard: Tell you what, the surgery\u2019s not for a week, I\u2019ll think about it.\nSheldon: Thank you. And while you\u2019re thinking about it, if you have the surgery in Nicaragua during monsoon season, I can practically guarantee your death.\nScene: Raj\u2019s apartment.\nRaj (on phone): Yes. Okay. I, I understand. Of course, yes. I\u2019ll call you tomorrow. Bye.\nHoward: So I found this fencing school in Burbank that has a Jedi class. And if you\u2019re cool being the only adults there, they said they are.\nRaj: Dude, my parents just split up.\nHoward: What?\nRaj: Uh, that was my dad on the phone. He moved out.\nHoward: Oh, my God, I, I\u2019m sorry. I mean, if you\u2019re not up to it, we don\u2019t have to go out, we can just hang here.\nRaj: No, it\u2019s fine. It\u2019s not that big a deal. As long as they\u2019re happy, I\u2019m happy. And when I get to see them for the holidays, I\u2019ll get to celebrate Diwali twice, one at each house. That\u2019s double the Diwali.\nHoward: You sure you\u2019re okay?\nRaj: I\u2019m okay.\nHoward: You don\u2019t look okay.\nRaj: How can I be okay? I come from a broken home.\nScene: A waiting room.\nLeonard: The doctor said I should be out of surgery by ten.\nPenny: Okay. And Sheldon really believes we\u2019re at a public swimming pool?\nLeonard: He was so busy figuring out how many parts per million of urine we\u2019d be floating around in, he didn\u2019t even question it.\nScene: Amy\u2019s car.\nSheldon: 18 parts per million. And he\u2019s still doing it.\nAmy: Don\u2019t worry about that. I\u2019m happy to take you to work.\nSheldon: Well, thank you. And Leonard never lets me have French toast sticks in the car. I can\u2019t have syrupy fingers, but he can do the backstroke in a toilet bowl.\nAmy: It\u2019s nice they\u2019re getting exercise.\nSheldon: Although now that I think about it, Leonard would never go swimming in public without his swim shirt.\nAmy: I\u2019m sure he brought it.\nSheldon: No, but last year, at Magic Mountain, he got such a bad sunburn, we had to cut him out of it.\nAmy: He probably got a new one. Finish your breakfast. Look, there\u2019s an entire section of my dashboard that doesn\u2019t have any syrup on it.\nSheldon: You\u2019re acting odd. Why?\nAmy: I\u2019m odd all the time, everyone knows that. Just last night I tried to see how many fava beans I could fit in my mouth.\nSheldon: Tell me the truth.\nAmy: Twenty eight.\nSheldon: Come on.\nAmy: Fifty six.\nSheldon: Amy. What\u2019s going on?\nAmy: All right. Don\u2019t get upset, but, an earlier appointment opened up for Leonard and he\u2019s getting the surgery right now.\nSheldon: I see. Take me to Leonard.\nAmy: Just go to work, he\u2019ll be fine.\nSheldon: Amy, he\u2019s my best friend, and if you don\u2019t take me, I\u2019m going there anyway.\nAmy: Fine. It\u2019s sweet that you care about him so much.\nSheldon: I do. And I wouldn\u2019t be able to forgive myself if something happened to him and I wasn\u2019t at his bedside to say I told you so.\nScene: The waiting room. \nSheldon: Hello.\nPenny: We had a really nice swim.\nSheldon: Oh, stop it. I assume this medical centre\u2019s already treated the burns on your bottom from the recent pants fire.\nPenny: \u2018Cause I\u2019m a liar, liar?\nSheldon: That\u2019s for the fire marshal to determine.\nPenny: You had to tell him?\nAmy: He wore me down. And I was distracted, he has on extra baby powder today.\nSheldon: Is he okay?\nPenny: He\u2019s still in surgery.\nSheldon: Very well.\nPenny: He\u2019s gonna be all right. That is sticky.\nAmy: Come on, let\u2019s talk about something other than the surgery.\nSheldon: That\u2019s a good idea. Penny, did you and Leonard ever discuss funeral arrangements?\nPenny: I think she meant something a little happier.\nSheldon: I suppose we could try to make it a celebration, but he died so young.\nScene: Raj\u2019s office.\nHoward: Knock, knock.\nBernadette: Hi.\nRaj: Hey. What brings you by?\nBernadette: Oh, muffin much.\nHoward: Told you, not funny.\nBernadette: He\u2019s just not laughing because he\u2019s feeling blueberry. Tough crowd.\nRaj: I\u2019m sorry. This is very sweet. Thanks.\nHoward: So, how you doing?\nRaj: Better. I guess the news just hit me a lot harder than I expected.\nBernadette: Well, of course. I would be devastated if my parents split up.\nHoward: Why? Your father barely speaks to your mother.\nBernadette: Well, at least he stuck around, not like your dad, who just took off.\nHoward: As you can see, we\u2019re here to cheer you up.\nBernadette: Sorry, Raj. Do you have any sense of what happened with your folks?\nRaj: I think, over time, they started to resent each other, and instead of talking about the things that bothered them, they kept it bottled up, and the hate just grew.\nBernadette: It\u2019s a shame they spent all that time unhappy. But sometimes, there\u2019s muffin you can do about it. You get it, right?\nScene: The waiting room.\nPenny: Oh, it\u2019s nice you got him that.\nSheldon: Oh, this isn\u2019t for Leonard, no. Amy bought it for me.\nAmy: Stubbed his toe on the revolving door on the way in.\nSheldon: You know those confounded things make me dizzy.\nAmy: Who told you to keep going around?\nSheldon: There was a large plant in the lobby. It kept looking like the outside.\nPenny: Okay, listen, when Leonard comes out, he is not gonna feel great, so, please don\u2019t give him a hard time.\nAmy: Penny has a good point. This is like the man in the supermarket with the goiter on his neck. Whatever you\u2019re thinking, just keep it to yourself.\nSheldon: It was like a grapefruit.\nAmy: And I\u2019m sure he knew that before you held a grapefruit up next to it.\nSheldon: Well, I\u2019m not making any promises. Not only did Leonard take what I feel is an unnecessary risk, he deceived me.\nPenny: Okay, the reason he deceived you is you were being a pain in the ass.\nSheldon: The reason I was being a pain in the B is because I was worried about him, and no one else was.\nPenny: Really? You won\u2019t even say A?\nSheldon: You bet your sweet B I won\u2019t.\nPenny: Obviously, I care about Leonard. I\u2019m gonna spend the rest of my life with him.\nSheldon: And I\u2019m not? It\u2019s an earthquake. I knew it.\nPenny: Sheldon, it was just a little tremor.\nSheldon: A little tremor that turns routine sinus surgery into a frontal lobotomy. Oh, I don\u2019t care for this at all. Oh, I need to see he\u2019s okay.\nAmy: Sheldon, you can\u2019t go back there.\nSheldon: Try and stop me.\nAmy: Are you okay?\nSheldon: Why didn\u2019t you stop me?\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s apartment. \nBernadette: Can I tell you something? This whole thing with Raj\u2019s parents just got me a little worried about us.\nHoward: What are you talking about? We\u2019re fine. And Raj\u2019s parents probably split up because of Raj.\nBernadette: What?\nHoward: They always say the children aren\u2019t to blame, but, come on.\nBernadette: I\u2019m not joking, Howie. You heard what he said about his parents. It was the little things they kept bottled up. I don\u2019t want that to happen to us.\nHoward: How can I convince you it won\u2019t?\nBernadette: Well, is there anything about me you\u2019re keeping inside?\nHoward: I\u2019m not answering that. It\u2019s a trap.\nBernadette: So there are things you don\u2019t like.\nHoward: And here I am in the trap. You just keep talking. I\u2019m gonna chew my leg off.\nBernadette: Just tell me one thing that bothers you, and I promise I won\u2019t get mad.\nHoward: Okay. The truth is, sometimes, you\u2019re too beautiful.\nBernadette: Oh. Howie, be serious.\nHoward: Okay, okay. I really don\u2019t like how your wings poke me when we sleep \u2019cause you\u2019re an angel.\nBernadette: Okay, fine, maybe it was a bad idea.\nHoward: I just don\u2019t think the secret to a happy marriage is going out of our way to criticize each other. Although, there are ways to improve our communication. One thing I learned when I was in couples therapy was\u2026\nBernadette: Who were you in couples therapy with?\nHoward: Not important.\nBernadette: Was it your mom?\nHoward: Not important.\nBernadette: It was your mom.\nHoward: Anyway, the therapist had us tell each other what we loved about one another.\nBernadette: Oh, that\u2019s so sweet. I want to do that.\nHoward: All right.\nBernadette: Okay, um, I love that you make me laugh.\nHoward: Thank you. And I love that you\u2019re strong and independent.\nBernadette: And yet, I still love when you hold a door for me.\nHoward: I love that I\u2019m kind of a slob around here, and you\u2019re okay with that.\nBernadette: Uh-huh. And I love that I work and do all the cleaning, and you\u2019re okay with that.\nHoward: See, I am. Isn\u2019t this great?\nScene: The apartment.\nPenny: Come on, smile. This is gonna be my Christmas card.\nSheldon: You know this is all your fault.\nLeonard: How is it my fault?\nSheldon: I told you not to get the surgery.\nLeonard: Okay, first of all, the surgery was a success, and secondly, I didn\u2019t even want you there.\nSheldon: Wow. I don\u2019t know which hurts worse, my nose or my heart. Well, I\u2019m done speaking to you.\nAmy: Don\u2019t be like that. You two need to talk this out.\nPenny: Yeah, \u2019cause you sound really funny.\nLeonard: Sheldon, I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t tell you about the surgery, but you were worried about nothing.\nSheldon: Oh, you\u2019re hardly out of the woods, no. You still run the risk of infection, a blood clot, the possibility that an inattentive surgeon let a barn spider lay eggs in your nose. The minute you sneeze web, I\u2019m moving out.\nLeonard: I never thought I\u2019d say these words, but come on, nose spider.\nPenny: Who are you kidding? You were so panicked Leonard was gonna die, you\u2019ll never leave him.\nAmy: Sheldon will move out eventually.\nPenny: Yeah, once he figures out how to work a door.\nSheldon: I was not panicked, and I am not overly attached to Leonard.\nLeonard: You were so worried that you smashed your face trying to check on me. You love me.\nSheldon: Yeah. Tell me those aren\u2019t the words of a man with a spider eating its way through his brain. Amy, you\u2019re a neuroscientist. Crack his skull open, spray some Raid in there.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s apartment.\nBernadette: I love that you take pride in your looks, even when I have to pee in the morning, and you\u2019re in there spending an hour on your hair.\nHoward: I love that you\u2019re too good to pee in the kitchen sink.\nBernadette: I love that you have the confidence to speak, even without giving it an ounce of thought.\nHoward: And I love how your hair is always on the soap. It\u2019s like washing myself with a hamster.\nRaj: Hey, guys. Sorry I am so late. I was on the phone with my mother.\nBernadette: Oh, how is she?\nRaj: Pretty good. She bought the book Eat, Pray, Love and used it to set my father\u2019s Mercedes on fire. So, what\u2019s up with you guys?\nHoward: We\u2019re just saying all the things we love about each other.\nRaj: Oh, like you and I did at couples therapy.\nScene: The apartment. \nLeonard: Oh, what\u2019d you get?\nSheldon: Oh, I ordered it before your surgery. It\u2019s the urn I was going to put you in.\nPenny: Okay, that\u2019s morbid. Send it back.\nSheldon: I can\u2019t send it back, I had it engraved. Here lie the ashes of Leonard Hofstadter. He thought he was right, but his room mate knew better.\u201d\nLeonard: That\u2019s funny. Boy, I\u2019m gonna miss these painkillers.\nPenny: Hey, why did you get two? I\u2019m with stupid.\nSheldon: Oh, that one\u2019s mine.\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "8_22": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The apartment\nRaj: It\u2019s, like, the best one they make, I just can\u2019t get it to work.\nHoward: I\u2019ll figure it out.\nRaj: It streams HD video straight to your phone while it\u2019s flying.\nHoward: Nice. Where were you when I was single?\nLeonard: Okay, we should leave in about an hour. You all packed?\nPenny: Uh, yeah, I just need to throw in a few last minute things, you know, makeup, underwear, clothes.\nSheldon: If your bathroom floor counts as a carry-on, you\u2019re packed.\nAmy: Leonard, have you ever given a high school commencement speech before?\nLeonard: Nope. It\u2019s pretty exciting.\nSheldon: Aren\u2019t you afraid of being blinded?\nLeonard: How would I be blinded?\nSheldon: At the end of the ceremony, all the students throw those pointy hats in the air. It\u2019s all pomp and circumstance until someone loses an eye.\nLeonard: I\u2019ll take my chances.\nSheldon: Fine. I wonder if they make I told you so cards in braille.\nRaj: Look, the problem with commencement speeches is that they\u2019re boring. Ooh, do you own a T-shirt cannon?\nHoward: Why would he own a T-shirt cannon?\nRaj: I don\u2019t know. Why do I own one?\nAmy: I think it\u2019s really nice that you\u2019re sharing this experience with Penny.\nLeonard: Mm, I thought it\u2019d be fun to show her my old stomping grounds. I even know the exact spot where they used to stomp me.\nBernadette: Well, now you get to go back as a successful scientist.\nAmy: With a beautiful girl on your arm.\nSheldon: And a pointy hat sticking out of your eyeball.\nCredits sequence. \nScene: The hallway.\nLeonard: How\u2019d you get ready so fast?\nPenny: Oh, I pack light. Once, I got through an entire spring break with nothing but a long T-shirt and a belt.\nLeonard: Why did you need a belt?\nPenny: It\u2019s called an evening look. I\u2019ve never been to New Jersey before.\nLeonard: It gets a bad rap from shows like Jersey Shore and Real Housewives.\nPenny: So it\u2019s not really like that?\nLeonard: No, it\u2019s like that. Well, I\u2019m excited to show you around.\nPenny: You think we\u2019ll have time to visit your mom over there?\nLeonard: Yes. We\u2019ll also have time to put my junk in a garlic press, but I\u2019m not doing that either. (Receives text) Uh-oh. I just got an alert. Our flight\u2019s been cancelled.\nPenny: What?\nLeonard: Yeah, looks like there\u2019s a big storm all up the East Coast.\nPenny: Well, can we get on another airline?\nLeonard: I don\u2019t think so.\nPenny: So, that\u2019s it? We\u2019re not going?\nLeonard: I guess not.\nPenny: Well, that sucks.\nLeonard: Yeah. I worked hard on that speech, too.\nPenny: Oh. You could tell it to me.\nLeonard: Oh, thank you, but I\u2019m okay.\nPenny: Are you sure? I could pretend I\u2019m a high school cheerleader who can\u2019t control herself around esteemed alumni.\nLeonard: Greetings, distinguished cheerleaders.\nPenny: Ooh.\nScene: The apartment.\nHoward: Okay, the WiFi extender is on, the camera\u2019s on, they\u2019re both on the same network. We should be getting an image.\nSheldon: All I see is a black screen. And my own reflection. I look sad.\nHoward: Maybe we should recalibrate it.\nSheldon: All right.\nHoward: Step one, rapidly flip the calibration switch from the fully up to the fully down positions for at least ten times.\nSheldon: It actually says at least?\nHoward: Yeah.\nSheldon: Why would they say at least? Is it ten toggles? Is it a hundred toggles? You know? Is it a thousand toggles? Ten thousand toggles? A hundred thousand toggles?\nHoward: Sheldon.\nSheldon: You see where I\u2019m going with this.\nHoward: Just flip the switch until the lights on the drone change to solid yellow.\nSheldon: All right, that seems simple enough. Initiating calibration sequence. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. Well, I suppose ten is technically at least ten. But they\u2019re still getting at least one angry letter.\nHoward: Now I rotate it horizontally on its centre axis until the lights turn green.\nSheldon: Initiating rotation sequence. Don\u2019t look at me, initiate. What does red and yellow mean?\nHoward: It means the calibration failed. We have to start over.\nSheldon: Oh. Very well. Re-initiating calibration sequence. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten\u2026 eleven. It\u2019s a good thing I didn\u2019t send that letter.\nScene: Raj\u2019s apartment. Skype tone plays.\nRaj: Mm. Hello, Daddy. What\u2019s up?\nDr Koothrapalli: Not much, just wanted to see how my son\u2019s doing.\nRaj: Very well, thank you.\nDr Koothrapalli: Are you still dating that dermatologist?\nRaj: If you could feel how soft my skin is, you wouldn\u2019t have to ask.\nDr Koothrapalli: Oh, and there\u2019s something else I wanted to ask you. Why did you spend a month\u2019s rent on a toy helicopter?!\nRaj: Oh, you\u2019re where that bill goes.\nDr Koothrapalli: I\u2019m tired of indulging your foolish lifestyle. It\u2019s time you learned responsibility. And the only way to teach you that is to cut off your allowance.\nRaj: No, Daddy, no. There are lots of other ways to teach me responsibility. I know, you can give me an egg and make me take care of it for a week.\nDr Koothrapalli: No, my mind is made up. Starting now, you\u2019re on your own.\nRaj: But, Daddy, I, I miss my family so much, and with you and Mummy getting a divorce, I feel sad and empty. Buying a little toy every now and then helps me fill that void. So while I can\u2019t hug you every day, flying that helicopter\u2026\nDr Koothrapalli: I\u2019m cutting you off.\nRaj: Just to be clear, financially or mid-sentence?\nScene: The apartment.\nHoward: No red and yellow, no red and yellow.\nSheldon: Yay.\nHoward: It\u2019s green.\nSheldon: We did it. Oh, if it\u2019s this much fun to rotate, imagine when we fly it.\nHoward: Okay, now all I have to do is rotate it vertically until the lights turn off.\nSheldon: Oh, no.\nHoward: Oh. All right, playtime\u2019s over. Let\u2019s open this baby up.\nSheldon: Won\u2019t that void the warranty?\nHoward: Sheldon, I have a master\u2019s degree in engineering. I wipe my bottom with warranties. Except for AppleCare. That pays for itself in the long run.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment.\nPenny: Hi.\nLeonard: Hey, where\u2019d you go?\nPenny: I got you a little something to cheer you up.\nLeonard: Really? Sex last night, pancakes this morning, am I dying?\nPenny: Just open it.\nLeonard: A cap and gown? Why do I need a cap and gown?\nPenny: Because you are giving your commencement speech.\nLeonard: What are you talking about?\nPenny: I called your old high school and convinced them to let you give your speech over Skype.\nLeonard: Really? That\u2019s amazing. And you gave me the robes to give it in. Thank you.\nPenny: Yeah, now about those, uh, they came from a costume shop, and all they had left was sexy graduate, so they might be a little short.\nLeonard: Short and sexy, that\u2019s my wheelhouse.\nPenny: Yeah.\nScene: The apartment.\nHoward: Boy, oh, boy, that\u2019s a lot of pieces.\nSheldon: You know what they all do, right?\nHoward: Yes, of course.\nSheldon: What about this one?\nHoward: Well, I, how familiar are you with miniaturized integrated logic circuits?\nSheldon: Not very.\nHoward: That right there is a miniaturized integrated logic circuit.\nSheldon: So, can you get it working?\nHoward: I\u2019m an MIT-trained engineer. I\u2019ve built components for the space station.\nSheldon: I thought the zero-gravity toilet didn\u2019t work.\nHoward: It worked fine, it just wasn\u2019t designed for Russian cosmonauts and their potato-based diet.\nRaj: Hey, guys.\nHoward: Hey.\nSheldon: Hello.\nRaj: I have to return the helicopter. My father\u2026 What did you do?\nSheldon: Well, don\u2019t worry. He went to MIT. He can solve any problem, as long as it doesn\u2019t originate in a Russian man\u2019s colon.\nRaj: I don\u2019t freaking believe this.\nHoward: Relax, it\u2019ll be fine.\nRaj: No, you have to put this back together right now, so I can return it.\nSheldon: You can\u2019t return it. Howard wiped his bottom with the warranty.\nRaj: What?\nSheldon: I think metaphorically. But he was in the bathroom for a while.\nRaj: Howard, my father cut me off. I have to get my money back for this.\nHoward: Calm down.\nRaj: Okay. Okay, you\u2019re right. It\u2019s time for me to step up and take responsibility for my life. Be a man. (On phone) Hello, Mummy.\nMrs Koothrapalli: Hello, Rajesh. What a nice surprise.\nRaj: Well, I\u2019ve been thinking about you. How are you doing? Are you happy, Mummy?\nMrs Koothrapalli: Such a sweet boy for asking. Can\u2019t believe you come from the poison seed of your father.\nRaj: Well, I like to think I take mostly after you. Anyway, speaking of Daddy, I had a very strange conversation with him. He said he couldn\u2019t afford to send me money any more because of his active social life.\nMrs Koothrapalli: What does that mean, active social life?\nRaj: Well, let\u2019s not talk about him or whatever shenanigans he may or may not be up to. Let\u2019s talk about you.\nMrs Koothrapalli: Rajesh, is your father seeing someone?\nRaj: All I know, Mummy, is that he\u2019s a single wealthy doctor, and now, for some reason, there\u2019s no money for your little boy.\nMrs Koothrapalli: Well, however much money your father was giving you, I\u2019ll give you more.\nRaj: Thank you, Mummy, I love you. Helicopters for everybody.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment.\nPenny: What\u2019s taking so long?\nLeonard: I don\u2019t think this is gonna work.\nPenny: Just let me see. Sweetie, you know you\u2019re supposed to wear clothes underneath a graduation gown.\nLeonard: A, surprised you know that. B, I wanted to look like a sexy graduate for you.\nPenny: Oh. Well, you do.\nLeonard: Thank you.\nPenny: Yeah. You\u2019re gonna be on Skype, they\u2019re not gonna see your legs.\nLeonard: Well, I\u2019m gonna go put on some pants just in case. But I have to say, this is very freeing.\nPenny: Add a belt and I\u2019ll take you some place nice.\nLeonard: Oh. Done and done.\nScene: The apartment.\nHoward: Okay, I think I\u2019ve narrowed it down to a faulty pin on the onboard communication chip.\nSheldon: Very impressive. You know, when you\u2019re done with that, can you look at this? It doesn\u2019t make smoke anymore.\nHoward: One toy at a time.\nSheldon: Mm. Sorry. Ah, maybe it\u2019s for the best. I hear locomotive smoke is the second leading cause of death among train aficionados.\nRaj: What\u2019s the first one?\nHoward: Suicide.\nSheldon: Wrong. Obesity.\nBernadette: I have the tool you wanted.\nHoward: Thank you.\nRaj: You guys don\u2019t have to go to the trouble. I\u2019m back in the money now, I can just buy another helicopter.\nHoward: It\u2019s not about the money. It\u2019s about solving a problem. It\u2019s why I became an engineer. It\u2019s what I like to do, it\u2019s what I\u2019m trained to do. It\u2019s who I am.\nSheldon: Oh, look at you, the little engineer that could.\nBernadette: Why don\u2019t you just call tech support?\nHoward: Hey.\nSheldon: Whoa.\nRaj: Not cool.\nBernadette: What?\nHoward: There\u2019s two kinds of people in this world, those who call tech support, and those who make fun of the people who call tech support.\nBernadette: I call tech support all the time.\nHoward: Ha-ha.\nSheldon: You call tech support.\nRaj: What a baby.\nScene: Leonard\u2019s old school. \nHeadmaster: And now, for our commencement address, one of our most distinguished alumni, noted Caltech physicist Dr. Leonard Hofstadter.\nLeonard (on screen): Members of the faculty, students, I\u2019m excited to speak to you today. I can\u2019t help but remember the last time I was in this auditorium. Two guys from the lacrosse team played keep-away with my asthma inhaler. But enough about my ten-year reunion. I\u2019d also like to take a moment to thank my beautiful fianc\u00e9e for to helping make this speech possible, even though weather nearly prevented it.\nPenny: Oh. Hello. I, I didn\u2019t know he was gonna point it at me, so, don\u2019t do drugs and stay in school.\nLeonard: They\u2019re graduating.\nPenny: Okay, bye.\nScene: The apartment. \nHoward: All right, the power supply is reconnected. I think we\u2019re back in business. Let\u2019s just run a few tests before we take it outside. Sheldon, we got WiFi?\nSheldon: Check.\nHoward: GPS?\nRaj: Check.\nHoward: Battery charged?\nSheldon: Check.\nBernadette: Four hours of our lives gone? Check.\nHoward: All right. All systems go. In five\u2026\nTogether: Four, three, two, one.\nSheldon: That\u2019s what my train used to do.\nBernadette: Ready to call tech support?\nHoward: Give me the number. Probably wind up talking to some foreign guy who\u2019s reading from the same manual I have. (Raj\u2019s phone rings)\nRaj: It\u2019s my father, you jerks. Hello, Daddy.\nDr Koothrapalli: What did you say to your mother?\nRaj: Nothing. I was just calling to check in, make sure she\u2019s doing okay.\nDr Koothrapalli: Well, after talking to you, she seems to think I\u2019m some sort of playboy.\nRaj: Really? I don\u2019t know where she\u2019d get an idea like that. You know Mummy and her crazy imagination I\u2019m so lucky I take after you.\nDr Koothrapalli: You think you take after me?\nRaj: Well, I try to. I certainly wouldn\u2019t be a scientist if you hadn\u2019t been my role model. (Re-entering apartment) Who wants to go to Vegas in a real helicopter?\nScene: Leonard\u2019s old school.\nLeonard (on screen): It was L. Frank Baum who said no thief, however skillful, can rob one of knowledge, and that is why knowledge is the best and safest treasure, wow, I\u2019m boring myself. Sorry, I can\u2019t see any of your faces right now, but I bet they look like this. Uh, you know, I, I wrote an entire speech to say how high school prepares you and what a wonderful place it is, but I hated it. Maybe high school\u2019s great if you look like this, but I didn\u2019t even feel like I existed at that school. And now that I think about it, I bet a lot of you feel the same way. So, for the remainder of my speech, this is for the invisible kids. Uh, maybe you never fit in. Or maybe you\u2019re the smallest kid in the school, or the heaviest or the weirdest. Maybe you\u2019re graduating and you still haven\u2019t had your first kiss. By the way, 19, and Geraldine Coco, wherever you are, thank you. Maybe you don\u2019t have any friends. And guess what? That\u2019s okay. While all the popular kids are off doing whatever, I don\u2019t know what they were doing \u2019cause I was never there.\nPenny: I\u2019ll, I\u2019ll tell you later.\nLeonard: My point is, while you\u2019re spending all this time on your own, building computers or practicing your cello, what you\u2019re really doing is becoming interesting. And when people finally do notice you, they\u2019re gonna find someone a lot cooler than they thought. And for those of you who were popular in high school, it\u2019s over, sorry. Thank you and congratulations.\nScene: The apartment. \nTech Support Voice: Your call is important to us. All our technicians are busy helping other customers. Please stay on the line and someone will be with you shortly.\nHoward: What happened to me? When did I become an old man baffled by modern technology? Next thing you know, I\u2019ll be hitching my pants up to my armpits and complaining about the awful music the kids are listening to.\nSheldon: It is awful, isn\u2019t it? Listen to that noise.\nHoward: Hang on, hang on. It\u2019s working. I did it.\nRaj: How\u2019d you do that?\nHoward: No idea, but I did it.\nBernadette: Maybe you shouldn\u2019t be flying it inside.\nHoward: Well, I\u2019m not flying it.\nSheldon: Then who is?\nHoward: I don\u2019t know. Must be getting a WiFi signal from somewhere else.\nSheldon: Initiate landing sequence. Initiate landing sequence. Hey, the camera\u2019s working. Oh, look, it\u2019s me.\nTech Support Guy: Tech Support, can I help you?\nSheldon: Yes, it\u2019s a robot uprising. Call the police.\nScene: The hallway.\nLeonard: So you really think they liked it?\nPenny: Oh, sweetie, it was the best speech I\u2026\nSheldon: Don\u2019t worry, everyone in here is safe.\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "4_6": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The university cafeteria. \nHoward: Gagh!\nLeonard: Problem?\nHoward: This is the worst cobbler I\u2019ve ever eaten. I mean it tastes like it was made of actual ground-up shoemaker.\nSheldon: Amusing. A play on the two meanings of cobbler.\nRaj: Hey guys, guess who I found at LAX. My baby sister Priya.\nSheldon: Excuse me. I object. You propose a guessing game, yet you don\u2019t give me enough time to guess. For the record, I was going to say your sister Priya.\nPriya: Oh, Sheldon. You haven\u2019t changed a bit, have you?\nSheldon: Why would I change?\nLeonard: The hope has been that you\u2019d eventually bend to public opinion. So, Priya, what brings you back to LA?\nPriya: I have a one day layover on my way to Toronto. Corporate merger.\nRaj: Can you believe it? Little Priya\u2019s one of the lead attorneys for the biggest car company in India.\nSheldon: Given that when we met her she was finishing law school and planning an internship at a large Indian car company, it\u2019s actually extremely plausible.\nLeonard: And your poll numbers just keep dropping.\nPriya: I want to catch up with all of you, but first I really must visit the loo.\nLeonard: I\u2019m going too, I\u2019ll show you where it is.\nRaj: Alright, this goes without saying, but I\u2019m just going to say it anyway. Hands off my sister.\nSheldon: Why would I touch her, she\u2019s covered with airplane germs.\nRaj: I\u2019m so not talking to you. I\u2019m talking to him.\nHoward: Hey, I\u2019ve got a girlfriend now.\nRaj: Oh please. My sister\u2019s much hotter than your girlfriend and you know it.\nHoward: Let\u2019s just agree they\u2019re both hot.\nRaj: Dude, that\u2019s my sister you\u2019re talking about.\nHoward: Okay, forget who\u2019s hotter. The first time Priya came to LA, Leonard and I made a pact out of respect to our friendship, and to you, that neither of us would hit on her.\nRaj: Did you pinky swear?\nHoward: Yes.\nRaj: Okay then.\nSheldon: Cobbler. I\u2019m still laughing.\nScene: A corridor.\n \nPriya: It\u2019s really nice to see you again Leonard.\nLeonard: Yeah. It\u2019s good to see you too. Here you go.\nPriya: Thanks. (Grabs him and kisses him.) \nLeonard: Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa. (Looks around.) Okay.\nCredits sequence.\n \nScene: The cafeteria.\n \nHoward: So, you got any special plans with your sister?\nRaj: Oh, not really, just hang out.\nSheldon: I always tell people, if you have only one day in Los Angeles, make it a train day.\nRaj: Train day?\nSheldon: The fun starts with brunch at Carney\u2019s in Studio City, a hot dog stand in a converted railroad dining car. Next stop, Travel Town, an outdoor museum featuring 43 railroad engines, cars and other rolling stock from the 1880s to the 1930s. Finally, we\u2019re off to the glitz and glamour of Hollywood for dinner at, that\u2019s right, the Hollywood Carney\u2019s, a hot dog stand in a different converted railroad dining car.\nRaj: I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to do that.\nSheldon: Well then apparently, you hate fun.\nLeonard: Hmm, Priya\u2019s not back yet? Well, I guess that\u2019s not unusual, women, men, the whole sitting, standing deal, so, what are we talking about?\nRaj: Uh, my plans with Priya.\nSheldon: He rejected train day.\nLeonard: Did you make it clear that it\u2019s two different train cars turned into hot dog stands?\nSheldon: Abundantly.\nLeonard: I guess he just hates fun.\nSheldon: That\u2019s what I said.\nPriya: Okay, so, what\u2019s new with you guys.\nHoward: I have a girlfriend now.\nPriya: Hey, good for you.\nHoward: Yeah, I just wanna put it out there in case I inadvertently squirt any pheromones in your direction. Happy? (Raj nods). \n \nLeonard: So, uh, Priya, what are your plans while you\u2019re here.\nPriya: I don\u2019t know, I just have the one day.\nSheldon: Do you like trains?\nPriya: Not particularly.\nSheldon: You might as well just wait at the airport for your flight.\nScene: The apartment. Sheldon is on his laptop.\n \nSheldon: You are in a forest. There is quicksand to the west, a path leads to the east. Go east. An iron gate blocks your way. Open gate. It\u2019s locked. Hmm, well, so much for that.\nLeonard: It\u2019s getting pretty late, how come you\u2019re still up?\nSheldon: I\u2019ve found an emulator online that lets you play classic text based computer games from the 1980s.\nLeonard: That\u2019s pretty cool.\nSheldon: Oh yes. It runs on the world\u2019s most powerful graphics chip, imagination.\nLeonard: You\u2019ve really got to get out more.\nSheldon: Go north. You can\u2019t go that way. Go west. A troll blocks your passage. Okay, fasten your seatbelts, kill troll. With what? With sword. (There is a knock on the door.) You don\u2019t have the sword. Good golly, it\u2019s as if it\u2019s actually happening to me.\nPriya (at door): Raj finally went to bed.\nLeonard: Yeah, well, (kissing her) Sheldon\u2019s still up.\nPriya: You said he goes to bed at nine.\nLeonard: Yeah, he does but he got caught up in a computer game and\u2026\nSheldon: Hit troll with axe. Hit troll with axe. Hit troll with axe. Oh my, this is one tough troll.\nPriya: Can\u2019t you get rid of him?\nLeonard: If the past is any indication, no.\nSheldon: Leonard, I\u2019m trapped in quicksand, the axe is dragging me down.\nLeonard: Drop axe.\nSheldon: Drop axe. Brilliant.\nLeonard: Give me a minute. Sheldon,\nSheldon: Hold on. I have to figure out how to get the bucket, so I can carry the mud past the dragon.\nLeonard: Sheldon, you need to work in the morning.\nSheldon: I know.\nLeonard: Well then, bed mister.\nSheldon: Five more minutes.\nLeonard: Really? You\u2019re going to risk getting sleepy in the middle of your thermodynamic fluctuations seminar? You know what happens when you yawn in public.\nSheldon: Everyone will see my oddly shaped uvula.\nLeonard: You don\u2019t want that, do you?\nSheldon: No. But it\u2019s a shame our society mocks the differently uvulated. Who was at the door?\nLeonard: Oh, uh, building manager. They have to fix a pipe so the water will be off tomorrow from noon to two.\nSheldon: That\u2019s unacceptable. We\u2019re supposed to be given written notice.\nLeonard: No, no, it doesn\u2019t matter, we\u2019ll be at work.\nSheldon: Well, what if I spill tomato soup on my shirt and have to come home to change, only to find there\u2019s no water for an enzyme soak.\nLeonard: Bifurcated uvula, Sheldon!\nSheldon: I\u2019ll have the chicken noodle. Goodnight.\nLeonard (to Priya): We\u2019re going to have to be very quiet.\nSheldon: I know how to get the bucket! I can turn the axe around and use the handle to reach it. Let\u2019s see. Go north. You are in a forest. Go north. You are in a forest. Go north. You are in a forest. Oh dear, I believe I\u2019m lost. Well, I\u2019ll just have to get a fresh start tomorrow.\nLeonard: No, no, no, no, no. You just need, you just need, you just need to map it out. Come on, I\u2019ll help you. So, uh, you stopped at the stream and you turned north three times?\nSheldon: Yes.\nLeonard: You\u2019re right, you\u2019re lost, good luck.\nScene: Leonard\u2019s bedroom. Morning. \n \nPriya: Oh! Leonard, wake up.\nLeonard: Huh! Sorry!\nPriya: For what?\nLeonard: I don\u2019t know. When I\u2019m in bed with a girl, it\u2019s just, it\u2019s my go to response.\nPriya: It\u2019s six o\u2019 clock, I have to get back to Raj\u2019s before he wakes up and realises I\u2019m gone.\nLeonard: Oh, right, sure. I wish you could stay in LA a while longer.\nPriya: Mmm. Me too.\nLeonard: You know, I was thinking, there are some great research facilities in India.\nPriya: Where are you going with this, Leonard?\nLeonard: Well, I\u2019m just saying, I don\u2019t have any real ties here, so if I were to move to New Delhi we could, you know, go out.\nPriya: Leonard, didn\u2019t we have this conversation five years ago.\nLeonard: Well, yes, but, things have changed, you know, you\u2019re older, I\u2019m older. Look, no more superhero bedsheets.\nPriya: Sweetheart, just because we have fun when I come to town doesn\u2019t mean I want to have a serious relationship.\nLeonard: It doesn\u2019t?\nPriya: Mm-mm. And besides, I could never bring a white boy home to my parents. They\u2019d have a cow. Which is a much bigger deal in India.\nLeonard: I\u2019m not that white. My great-great grandmother was half Cherokee. I know that\u2019s not the right kind of Indian but it is something.\nPriya: Aha, you\u2019re funny.\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard. (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard. (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard.\nLeonard: What?\nSheldon: I heard a woman laughing.\nLeonard: Oh, uh, yeah, I was trying to see if I could laugh as a woman.\nSheldon: Oh. Well, good job, quite convincing. I smell perfume.\nLeonard: Air freshener.\nSheldon: And is that lipstick on your cheek and neck.\nLeonard: Uh, rash, that\u2019s a bad rash.\nSheldon: My sympathies. I am no stranger to the crimson scourge that is dermatitis. Can I interest you in a topical steroid from my lotion and unguent collection?\nLeonard: Uh, yeah, yeah, that sounds great.\nSheldon: Very well, I\u2019m sure I can find something that will help you ditch that itch.\nLeonard: Okay, he\u2019s in the bathroom, let\u2019s go.\nSheldon: Do you prefer ointment or cream?\nLeonard: Uh, cream.\nSheldon: With or without a numbing agent?\nLeonard: Without.\nSheldon: Really? Leonard, there are no heroes when it comes to dermatitis.\nLeonard: Fine. With.\nSheldon: Prescription or non-prescription strength.\nLeonard: Use your best judgement.\nSheldon: Well, I think I have a nice 2009 AnaMantle HC. It\u2019s usually indicated for acutely inflamed haemorrhoids, but it also goes nicely with non mucosal body parts.\nLeonard: Sounds great.\nSheldon: Excellent choice.\nLeonard (whispering): Right, right, alright. (They creep almost to the apartment door.)\n \nSheldon: Priya?\nPriya: Good morning, Sheldon.\nSheldon: For shame, Leonard. For shame. And to think I was ready to waste the last of my good haemorrhoid cream on you.\nScene: Leonard\u2019s car. \n \nLeonard: Making pretty good time, huh?\nSheldon: Is that really what you want to talk about, Leonard?\nLeonard: No.\nSheldon: What do you want to talk about?\nLeonard: Please don\u2019t tell anyone I spent the night with Raj\u2019s sister.\nSheldon: There it is. What if someone asks?\nLeonard: No-one\u2019s going to ask if I spent the night with Raj\u2019s sister.\nSheldon: Perhaps. But they might ask me something else.\nLeonard: Like what?\nSheldon: Like, has Leonard betrayed any of his friends recently?\nLeonard: Priya and I are both adults. We didn\u2019t betray Raj.\nSheldon: In fact, you did, but I was referring to Howard.\nLeonard: What are you talking about?\nSheldon: April 12th, 2005, Bob\u2019s Big Boy, Toluca Lake. Raj had just introduced us to Priya for the first time, and she was enjoying the sweet taste of Hindu rebellion in the form of a Bob\u2019s Super Big Boy hamburger. In order to preserve your friendship, you and Howard made a pinky swear that neither of you would attempt to woo her. I had a patty melt.\nLeonard: Okay, fine, I betrayed Howard.\nSheldon: And Raj.\nLeonard: Alright, and Raj.\nSheldon: And me.\nLeonard: You?\nSheldon: Violation of the roommate agreement, overnight guest notification clause.\nLeonard: Okay fine, I\u2019m, I\u2019m a horrible human being, I\u2019m the Darth Vader of Pasadena.\nSheldon: You\u2019re far too short to be Darth Vader. At best you might be a turncoat Ewok.\nLeonard: My point is, Priya\u2019s gone. And it would be much better if no-one else found out about this.\nSheldon: You mean, you want me to keep a secret.\nLeonard: Yes.\nSheldon: You know I can\u2019t keep a secret.\nLeonard: You can if you try. Think about it this way, if I were Batman and you were Alfred, you\u2019d keep that secret. Right?\nSheldon: Why do you get to be Batman?\nLeonard: Because, well, Batman has the secret.\nSheldon: Well Alfred has secrets too.\nLeonard: Like what?\nSheldon: Alfred knows that Barbara Gordon is Batgirl. Which I\u2019ve now just told to Batman. See, I can\u2019t keep a secret.\nScene: Leonard\u2019s lab.\n \nSheldon: Ta-da!\nLeonard: What.\nSheldon: Ta-da. It\u2019s short for da-da-da-da!\nLeonard: Kind of busy here, Sheldon.\nSheldon: I know, that\u2019s why I shortened it.\nLeonard: What do you want.\nSheldon: I came to go over your alibi for last night.\nLeonard: What alibi?\nSheldon: You\u2019ve asked me to lie on your behalf, and as you know, I am deeply uncomfortable with impromptu dishonest, so I\u2019ve provided you with an iron clad alibi. You couldn\u2019t have spent last night with Priya, because you were with another woman.\nLeonard: Oh, I\u2019m so sure I\u2019m going to regret this, but, who was I with?\nSheldon: The fun loving, and morally loose, Miss Maggie McGeary.\nLeonard: Oh, God.\nSheldon: You met her at Pasadena\u2019s most popular Irish watering hole, Lucky Baldwin\u2019s, where Maggie spends her nights tending bar, with a head full of curls and a heart full of dreams.\nLeonard (reading a napkin Sheldon has handed him): Leonard, call me if you\u2019re interested in coitus. Sincerely, Maggie McGeary.\nSheldon: And if anyone were to actually call that number they will hear this.\nMechanical voice on Sheldon\u2019s phone: Top of the morning to you. You\u2019ve reached Maggie McGeary. Leave a message after the wee little beep.\nSheldon: It\u2019s pretty convincing, huh? And it wasn\u2019t even a real person. And here is the clincher. A lock of Maggie\u2019s flaming auburn hair.\nLeonard: Where did you get that?\nSheldon: From an orang-u-tan in the primate lab.\nLeonard: An orang-u-tan?\nSheldon: Well, no-one\u2019s going to run a DNA test on it, Leonard, honestly you over-think everything.\nLeonard: Sheldon, I don\u2019t need an alibi. Nobody\u2019s going to ask about last night as long as you just zip your lip. (Sheldon makes lip zipping movement.) Thankyou. Now don\u2019t worry, everything is going to be fine. (Sheldon writes \u201cI doubt it\u201d on Leonard\u2019s whiteboard.\n \nScene: The cafeteria.\n \nLeonard: Hey.\nRaj: Hey, Leonard, will you please tell Howard my sister\u2019s never been attracted to him.\nLeonard: C\u2019mon Raj, how am I supposed to know who she\u2019s attracted to. Or was attracted to. Or who she might be attracted to. In the future.\nSheldon: And I have nothing to contribute to this conversation. Because I too know absolutely nothing about Priya\u2019s preferences in male companionship. And with that, I will re-zip my lip.\nRaj: Hey, so what did you guys think of the new episode of Caprica last night?\nLeonard: I didn\u2019t see it.\nHoward: Didn\u2019t see it? What were you doing?\nLeonard: Uh, I was out.\nRaj: On Caprica night?\nLeonard: Yeah, I, uh, went for a drink.\nHoward: Really, you, and where, where did you go?\nLeonard: To, uh, Lucky Baldwin\u2019s.\nSheldon: Oh, I\u2019ve heard of that place, isn\u2019t that Pasadena\u2019s favourite Irish watering hole.\nLeonard: Yes.\nSheldon: Did you meet anyone interesting there, perhaps a promiscuous redheaded barmaid?\nLeonard: As a matter of fact I.. I\u2026 I can\u2019t\u2026 I can\u2019t\u2026 I can\u2019t do it.\nSheldon: Sure you can, you\u2019re doing fine, it\u2019s very believable.\nLeonard: Look, I\u2019m sorry Raj, but the truth is I was with Priya last night.\nSheldon: Don\u2019t listen to him, he\u2019s still light headed from all the Irish whiskey and pickled eggs in his system.\nRaj: What were you doing with Priya?\nSheldon: I believe they engaged in coitus but, more importantly, if Leonard had not abandoned his story, would you have found it plausible?\nRaj: What? You slept with my sister?\nLeonard: Yeah.\nHoward: How could you? We had a pact!\nRaj: Excuse me, I think how could you she\u2019s my sister takes precedence over a five year old pinky swear!\nSheldon: May I point out, in a parallel universe, your friends are saying Maggie McGeary, she sounds lovely.\nLeonard: Look, I admit it, I may have crossed a line here, but come on, Raj, your sister is a grown woman. To her, I\u2019m a forbidden piece of white chocolate.\nRaj: I\u2026 I don\u2019t believe it, this is a terrible betrayal of my trust.\nLeonard: No, no, no, would it help if I told you that I offered her my heart and she kind of stomped on it.\nRaj: How hard did she stomp?\nLeonard: Very hard.\nRaj: Okay, I\u2019m good.\nHoward: Yeah, well, Raj, I just want to say that I\u2019d never betray your trust. Unlike Leonard, I respect you.\nLeonard: Really?\nHoward: Mmm.\nLeonard: Was it out of respect that you didn\u2019t tell Raj about the time you dropped his iPhone in a urinal?\nRaj: Dude! I put that thing on my face!\nSheldon: I think a more amusing violation of Raj\u2019s trust is when Howard convinced him that foreigners give presents to Americans on Thanksgiving.\nHoward: Hey, I didn\u2019t see you giving back your Snoopy snowcone maker.\nRaj: That was all a lie? This year\u2019s gifts are already wrapped!\nHoward: And as long as we\u2019re talking about betraying our friends, how about the month Sheldon spent grinding up insects and mixing them into Leonard\u2019s food.\nSheldon: Well, excuse me. That was not a betrayal, that was an experiment to determine at what concentration food starts tasting mothy.\nLeonard: You put moths in my food?\nSheldon: For science.\nRaj: I can\u2019t believe you kissed my sister with moth mouth.\nLeonard: Well, uh, I can\u2019t believe you used Sheldon\u2019s toothbrush.\nSheldon: You used my toothbrush?\nRaj: Not the brush part, just the little rubber thing to pick food from my teeth and massage my gums.\nLeonard: Okay, I, I, I think it\u2019s safe to say that we\u2019ve all done some things we\u2019re not particularly proud of. But come on, we\u2019re friends. Friends overlook each other\u2019s minor lapses. For the record, Howard, I\u2019m sorry that I broke our pact.\nHoward: Thankyou, and I\u2019m sorry about your phone. And Thanksgiving. And while we\u2019re at it, you don\u2019t have to wash our clothes on the fourth of July.\nRaj: As long as we\u2019re apologising, Sheldon, I, I\u2019m sorry I used your toothbrush.\nSheldon: And I\u2019m sorry. But that behaviour is beyond the pale and cannot be tolerated. We are no longer friends.\nRaj: I got you a talking Thomas the Tank Engine for Thanksgiving.\nSheldon: With real puffing smoke?\nRaj: Yes.\nSheldon: Alright. But I\u2019m watching you.\nScene: The apartment. Sheldon is making snowcones.\n \nLeonard: Hey, you got Snoopy out. Can I have a snowcone?\nSheldon: Well, sure.\nLeonard: These are pretty god, what flavour is this?\nSheldon: Guess.\nLeonard: Papaya?\nSheldon: No.\nLeonard: Guava?\nSheldon: You\u2019re so close.\nLeonard: I give up.\nSheldon: Mango, caterpillar.

You said you liked it!\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "5_16": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The cafeteria.\nSheldon: Gentlemen, I think I\u2019ve come up with a fun way to get young people interested in science. Physics Mad-Libs. Now, give me a number.\nLeonard: Five.\nSheldon: Uh-huh. And an irrational constant.\nHoward: E.\nSheldon: And a funny Greek letter.\nRaj: Gamma.\nSheldon: I said funny.\nRaj: Upsilon?\nSheldon: Good one. And an electrical charge.\nLeonard: Positive.\nSheldon: Ha. Perfect. Okay. Get this. Professor Jones told the symposium he had a new method for calculating the mass of a muon. Five times the limit of E to the upsilon as in a (laughs uncontrollably). Okay. No, no. I\u2019ll start over. Professor (laughs again)\nHoward: I haven\u2019t seen him laugh that hard since the day Leonard made that multiplication error.\nSheldon: Oh, Oh, Lord, that multiplication error! He thought he carried the one. But he didn\u2019t.\nLeonard: It\u2019s not funny. That mistake got published.\nSheldon: Stop! I\u2019m going to wet myself!\nRaj: Hey, guys, guys, President Siebert is headed this way.\nHoward: I wonder what he wants.\nLeonard: Doesn\u2019t look happy, so I\u2019m guessing he wants to talk to Sheldon.\nSeibert: Dr. Cooper?\nLeonard: Told ya.\nSheldon: Oh, President Siebert, I assume you\u2019d like to respond to one of the suggestions I put in the box by your office.\nSeibert: No, and stop installing suggestion boxes everywhere.\nSheldon: You don\u2019t like written suggestions. You don\u2019t like when I give them to you while we\u2019re urinating in the men\u2019s room. If I didn\u2019t know any better, I\u2019d say that you\u2019re one of those stubborn people who are not open to suggestions.\nSeibert: Dr. Cooper, the physics department chair tells me you\u2019re refusing to take your vacation.\nSheldon: I don\u2019t need a vacation.\nSeibert: You\u2019re obligated to take one. And I\u2019d also like you to know the most-often received suggestion in my suggestion box you installed without asking me is can Dr. Cooper take a vacation? Okay, settled, then. I\u2019ll see you all on Monday, except for you.\nSheldon: But if I don\u2019t come into work, what am I supposed to do with myself?\nSeibert: Read, rest, travel.

That\u2019s how Velma and Scooby smuggled Shaggy into the old lighthouse.\nLeonard: What are you going to do when you get to the university? People are going to recognize you.\nSheldon: Will they, Leonard? (Puts on cap and long-hair wig)\nLeonard: Fine. Just get back under your blanket, and I\u2019ll drive you there.\nSheldon: And no more singing.\nLeonard: Fine.\nSheldon: I have GPS on my phone. I know you turned around.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment.\nPenny: I\u2019m so glad you talked Howard out of having your wedding invitations in Klingon.\nBernadette: Turn it over. I\u2019m hoping my relatives think it\u2019s Hebrew.\nAmy: This is really happening. I\u2019m gonna be a maid of honour. I\u2019m gonna wear a beautiful dress and walk down that aisle and, finally, I will have my special day.\nBernadette: You mean my special day?\nAmy: They\u2019re gonna need an extra-large veil for somebody\u2019s head.\nBernadette: If I ever actually ever get married.\nPenny: Why wouldn\u2019t you?\nBernadette: My dad. Because I make a lot more money than Howie, he\u2019s putting a lot of pressure on me to get a pre-nup.\nPenny: Ouch.\nBernadette: Yeah. Howie\u2019s gonna freak out.\nAmy: Parental pressure can be daunting. I remember the battle with my mother about shaving my legs. Last year, I finally gave in and let her do it.\nBernadette: I just don\u2019t know how I\u2019m gonna break it to him.\nPenny: You know, I\u2019m a big believer in breaking bad news to a guy when you\u2019re in bed with him. That\u2019s how I told my high school boyfriend I slept with his brother. That\u2019s how I told his brother the same thing.\nBernadette: I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t want to manipulate him with sex.\nPenny: Oh, sweetie, that\u2019s what sex is for.\nAmy: You know, the connection between marriage and money is nothing new. In fact, the term wed referred to the money and livestock that the groom paid the bride\u2019s father. For example, you\u2019re adorable, intelligent and a good earner. I could conservatively see you going for at least two oxen and a goose. (To Penny) You would fetch a unicorn.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: Sheldon, there are a million great vacations you could take. What about Hawaii?\nSheldon: Hawaii is a former leper colony on top of an active volcano where the disappointing ending to Lost was filmed. Mahalo for nothing, Hawaii.\nHoward: How about Florida? They\u2019ve got Cape Canaveral, they\u2019ve got Disney, they\u2019ve got my Aunt Ida and the world\u2019s largest collection of diabetic candy. Plus, if you get sweaty enough, her plastic-covered furniture is like a flume ride.\nSheldon: My family took a trip to Florida when I was a child. A seagull stole a hot dog from me on the beach. I got the message.\nRaj: You know, if I had a week off, I\u2019d go back to the Two Bunch Palms Resort and Spa in the desert. I tell you, an hour on the massage table with Trevor, and you\u2019ll feel like you were born without bones.\nHoward: I don\u2019t think I could ever let a guy give me a massage.\nRaj: Really? What was I doing to your neck last night while you were playing X-Box?\nSheldon: It\u2019s like I\u2019m living in a dictatorship. You must take a vacation, you must have fun, you must enjoy life.\nHoward: I don\u2019t think you have a good handle on dictatorships.\nLeonard: Sheldon, everybody takes vacations.\nSheldon: One time they tried to make Richard Feynman take a vacation, but he chose instead to expand his mind and learn something new. He went to work in his friend\u2019s biology lab. Richard Feynman was a famous American physicist, part of the Manhattan Project.\nHoward: Everyone in the world of science knows who Richard Feynman was.\nSheldon: Now you do, too. Oh! I have a brilliant idea. Amy\u2019s a biologist. I\u2019ll go work in her lab.\nHoward: Isn\u2019t that just Feynman\u2019s idea?\nSheldon: Ten seconds ago, you never heard of him. Now you\u2019re an expert.\nScene: The hallway.\nLeonard: Hey.\nPenny: Hey, you.\nLeonard: Is that your laundry? You only have, like, six things in there.\nPenny: Yeah, I didn\u2019t have any quarters, so I\u2019ve been sneaking stuff into other people\u2019s loads all day. Hey, if I tell you something, will you promise not to tell anybody?\nLeonard: It doesn\u2019t matter what I say, you\u2019re gonna tell me anyway.\nPenny: What? That is not true. Bernadette wants a pre-nup.\nLeonard: Wow. That\u2019s rough.\nPenny: So you\u2019re saying if I became a famous movie star, we got married, you wouldn\u2019t sign a pre-nup?\nLeonard: Absolutely not. If I\u2019m gonna be stuck at home with the kids while you\u2019re on location cheating on me with Ryan Gosling, then Leonard gots to get paid. So, you think about us getting married?\nPenny: I think about a lot of things. I think about us getting married, I think about us breaking up. Once in a while, I think about how I didn\u2019t leave a note on that Mercedes I dinged in the parking lot last month, but then I have a glass of wine and it passes.\nLeonard: Joke all you want, but you think about it.\nPenny: Well, tell you one thing, if I ever do get married, no Klingon invitations.\nLeonard: Good luck catching a man with that attitude.\nScene: Amy\u2019s laboratory.\nSheldon: Boy, oh, boy. This vacation is off to a wonderful start. The smell of formaldehyde, the whir of the centrifuge, the distant chatter of lab animals being dispatched for dissection. Mm, I can already feel my cares just melting away.\nAmy: I\u2019m excited to work with my boyfriend. It\u2019s gonna be romantic.\nSheldon: Way to kill the mood.\nAmy: Come on, Sheldon. We can be like Marie Curie and her husband, Pierre, who spent their days working side by side, bathed in the glow of their love and the radium that ultimately killed her. Screw Beauty and the Beast, that\u2019s the love story Disney should tell.\nSheldon: Okay, what do we start with? Maybe splicing some genes, clone a sheep, perhaps grow a human ear on a mouse\u2019s back? Ha-ha, I\u2019m a freak!\nAmy: Oh, I\u2019m gonna be doing some brain stem histology while you put yourself on the business end of a sponge and wash those beakers.\nSheldon: Wash those bea\u2026 Oh, I get it, a little hazing for the new fella. Yeah, I\u2019d better keep and eye out for, what, shoe polish on the microscope, or mad cow disease in my grilled cheese sandwich?\nAmy: No, I just need those beakers washed. Hippity-hop, quick like a bunny.\nSheldon: What? Excuse me, you have Dr. Sheldon Cooper in your lab. You\u2019re gonna make him do the dishes? That\u2019s like asking the Incredible Hulk to open a pickle jar.\nAmy: Sheldon, you\u2019ve never worked in a lab like this before. You have no experience in the field of biology.\nSheldon: I have plenty of experience in biology. I bought a Tamagotchi in 1998. And it\u2019s still alive. Let\u2019s do this.\nScene: The cafeteria.\nLeonard: Where\u2019s Howard?\nRaj: No hi, Raj? No how are you, Raj? Just straight to where\u2019s the other white guy?\nLeonard: I\u2019m sorry. So, listen, I heard something about him. Can you keep it between us?\nRaj: Ooh, gossip. When I first got here, I thought you Americans really gossiped around the water cooler. So I hung out there for, like, a month, but the only gossip I ever heard was about some creepy guy hanging out by the water cooler.\nLeonard: Bernadette wants to get a pre-nup.\nRaj: Oh, that\u2019s a shame, he\u2019s gonna be devastated.\nLeonard: I never know what to do in these situations. Should I give him a heads-up?\nRaj: Hmm. I\u2019m gonna give you the same advice I yell at the TV when the Bachelor\u2019s handing out roses. Follow your heart.\nHoward: Check it out. Look at the size of that Rice Krispie Treat. Same price.\nLeonard: Hey, Howard, I need to tell you something.\nHoward: I know, it\u2019s not on my wedding diet. I don\u2019t care.\nLeonard: Uh, listen, I heard that Bernadette\u2019s thinking about asking you for a pre-nup.\nHoward: A pre-nup? Wow.\nLeonard: What are you gonna do?\nHoward: I don\u2019t know.\nRaj: Follow your heart.\nHoward: You know what, it\u2019s not a big deal. She makes more money than me. She wants to protect her financial interests. It\u2019s completely reasonable.\nLeonard; Good. That\u2019s a healthy attitude.\nHoward: Yeah, actually, it\u2019s good for both of us. I have assets to protect, too.\nRaj: Like what?\nHoward: I\u2019ve got some rare comic books. The Vespa\u2019s almost paid off. And Ma and I have a primo double cemetery plot at Mt. Sinai right near the guy who played Mr. Roper on Three\u2019s Company.\nRaj: Mr. Roper\u2019s dead? You can\u2019t just spring that on a guy.\nScene: Amy\u2019s laboratory.\nSheldon: Here you go. This is now the only lab with glassware washed by a man with two doctorates and a restraining order signed by Carl Sagan.\nAmy: Soap spots. Wash \u2019em again.\nSheldon: Y-you\u2019re being ridiculous. Those are perfectly clean.\nAmy: Sheldon, this beaker used to contain cerebral spinal fluid from an elephant that died of syphilis. If it\u2019s, in fact, perfectly clean, drink from it.\nSheldon: Biologists are mean.\nLater.\nAmy: All right, perhaps this task will be a little bit more up your alley. I need you to count the bacteria spores on these petri dishes.\nSheldon: There was something wrong with that detergent. That was way too bubbly.\nAmy: I\u2019m sure it was.\nSheldon: I intend to write that soap company a strongly worded letter.\nAmy: Yeah, good for you. Now, start counting.\nSheldon: You know what this place needs? A suggestion box.\nLater.\nSheldon: 366\u2026 367\u2026\nAmy: How\u2019s it going?\nSheldon: How\u2019s counting going? When I was in kindergarten, I recited pi to a thousand places for the school talent show. I think I got this.\nAmy: Great.\nSheldon: Aw, nuts! One\u2026\nLater.\nSheldon: This is preposterous. I think you\u2019re giving me these tasks because you\u2019re afraid if you give me anything meaningful to do, I\u2019ll show you up.\nAmy: Really? Is that what you think?\nSheldon: Yes, that\u2019s what I think. And I\u2019m super smart, so it\u2019s probably true.\nAmy: Hey, I\u2019ve been training in the field of neurobiology for 12 years. You\u2019ve been here for three hours, and you\u2019ve spent one of them in the bathroom.\nSheldon: I\u2019m sorry. It takes me a while to get things going on an unfamiliar toilet.\nAmy: Sheldon, I\u2019ve given you the simplest things to do, and you haven\u2019t done one of them right.\nSheldon: Maybe that\u2019s because I\u2019m not being challenged. It\u2019s the same reason Einstein failed math.\nAmy: Maybe the math was too bubbly for him.\nSheldon: You think you\u2019re doing science by cutting up that brain? They could do the same thing at any Quiznos. And they\u2019d offer to toast it for me, too.\nAmy: Okay, smart guy. I\u2019m about to remove the locus coeruleus, which is incredibly delicate work. Have at it.\nSheldon: All right. I\u2019m no stranger to a little gray matter. Locus coeruleus. Locus coeruleus.\nAmy: You\u2019re getting warmer, it is, indeed, in the brain. Hope your hands are steady. It\u2019s the width of a single hair. But this is just biology, so I\u2019m sure it\u2019s no problem for a genius like you.\nSheldon: It\u2019s not. I\u2019ll have you know, in the field of physics, we work with particles so small, they make fat jokes about the locus coeruleus, i.e., when your locus coeruleus sits around the house, it sits around the house.\nAmy: Oh, are we nervous, Dr. Cooper?\nSheldon: No. What you see is a man trembling with confidence. Does a locus coeruleus normally bleed that much?\nAmy: No. But your thumb does.\nSheldon: Oh, dear. (Faints)\nAmy: Yeah, you\u2019re a biologist.\nScene: The bar at the Cheesecake Factory.\nHoward: What are you doing here?\nSheldon: I\u2019m on vacation. Social convention dictates that I let my hair down at a local watering hole. Social convention is stupid.\nHoward: What happened to your thumb?\nSheldon: You know, I have ten fingers and ten toes. If I tell you a story about each one of them, we\u2019ll be here all day, let\u2019s just move on.\nBarman: What can I get you?\nSheldon: Ah, seeing as I\u2019m on vacation, a pina colada seems appropriate. Extra pineapple slices, extra whipped cream, extra cherries, extra umbrellas, and, uh, hold the rum. Don\u2019t let me have too many of those.\nPenny: Hey, what are you guys doing here?\nHoward: We\u2019re grown men, we drink at bars.\nPenny: No and no. Everything okay with you and Bernadette?\nHoward: Oh, yeah, sure.\nPenny: You and Amy? Good?\nSheldon: Oh, better than good.\nPenny: You know those girls text me every detail of their lives as it happens.\nHoward: I\u2019m not signing a pre-nup.\nPenny: All right, Howard Wolowitz, listen up. You sign anything she puts in front of you, because you are the luckiest man alive. If you let her go, there is no way you can find anyone else. Speaking on behalf of all women, it is not gonna happen, we had a meeting. And you, a grown man fainting at the sight of a little blood.\nSheldon: Excuse me, this is a fairly substantial wound. (Removes plaster. Faints again)\nScene: Amy\u2019s laboratory.\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Amy? (Knock, knock, knock) Amy? (Knock, knock, knock) Amy?\nAmy: What do you want?\nSheldon: I was kind of hoping I could continue vacationing in your laboratory. After all, I did book the whole week.\nAmy: Do you honestly think you can just waltz back in here after the way you behaved yesterday?\nSheldon: I was not myself. I had lost a lot of thumb blood.\nAmy: That\u2019s not an apology.\nSheldon: That is your opinion.\nAmy: I want a real apology.\nSheldon: I\u2019m sorry that you weren\u2019t able to\u2026\nAmy: No.\nSheldon: That my genius\u2026\nAmy: No.\nSheldon: That the soap was\u2026\nAmy: Sheldon.\nSheldon: Fine. Sorry.\nAmy: You\u2019re forgiven. Now, if you want to stay, get started on those beakers. They\u2019re still dirty from yesterday.\nSheldon: Next year I\u2019m going to Epcot.\nScene: Bernadette\u2019s car.\nBernadette: Are you mad at me?\nHoward: No. I\u2019m not mad at you. I just wish you would have come to me, so I didn\u2019t have to hear it through the nerd-vine.\nBernadette: So, what are we gonna do?\nHoward: You really want me to sign a pre-nup?\nBernadette: I don\u2019t know. My dad\u2019s pretty insistent on it, though.\nHoward: Why don\u2019t I talk to your dad, man-to-man?\nBernadette: Really? Oh, that\u2019d be so great.\nHoward: Done.\nBernadette: I should probably give you a heads-up about a couple of things. Even though he\u2019s retired from the police force, he still carries his gun. But don\u2019t worry, he won\u2019t shoot it. It\u2019s more of a fashion statement.\nHoward: Okay.\nBernadette: And just to be safe, when you talk to him, don\u2019t bring up Jimmy Carter, gardeners, foreign people, homosexuals, Sean Penn, Vatican II, gun control, organic food, the designated hitter rule, recycling or the fact that you\u2019re Jewish.\nHoward: Got it, got it. Will you e-mail me that list?\nBernadette: So the thing to watch for, if he\u2019s shouting at you, you\u2019re okay, but if he starts to get real quiet, leave as quickly as you can without making eye contact. Not in a straight line, throw some zigs and zigs in there.\nHoward: You know, this isn\u2019t that pressing. Why don\u2019t I talk to him about it in May.\nBernadette: In May you\u2019re gonna be on the International Space Station.\nHoward: They\u2019ve got a phone.\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "5_19": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The stairwell\nRaj: Hey, want to spend some time playing the new Star Wars game this weekend?\nLeonard: Oh, I don\u2019t know. I kind of promised myself I\u2019d get off the computer, be more physically active. Get some exercise.\nHoward: You\u2019re about to walk up three flights of stairs.\nLeonard: Good point, I\u2019m in.\nRaj: You know what would be great? Let\u2019s do it like the old days.\nLeonard: You mean, are you talking gaming marathon?\nRaj: Yeah. Start Saturday morning, go 48 hours, sleeping bags, junk food.\nHoward: Turn off our phones so our moms can\u2019t call.\nLeonard: It would be like our World Of Warcraft a few years ago when the neighbours called the cops on us.\nHoward: They called the cops because of the smell. They thought we were dead.\nRaj: We were badass back in the day.\nLeonard: All right, let\u2019s do it.\nHoward: 48 hours of Star Wars gaming.\nRaj: It\u2019s on like Alderaan.\nLeonard: Hey, Sheldon, clear your weekend. Starting Saturday morning, Star Wars< marathon\nRaj: Woo-hoo!\nSheldon: Movies or video games? Or board game? Or trading card games? Or Lego\u2019s? Or dress up? Or comic books? Or dramatic readings of novelizations? Yes to all!\nLeonard: We are going to play the online game.\nSheldon: The online game? Bully!\nAmy: Gentlemen, as much as I\u2019m sure Sheldon would enjoy playing intergalactic make-believe, he and I have other plans. We are attending my Aunt Flora\u2019s 93rd birthday party.\nSheldon: Just tell her I can\u2019t come.\nAmy: She\u2019ll be disappointed if we don\u2019t show up.\nSheldon: She\u2019s 93. She won\u2019t be disappointed for very long.\nAmy: No, hang on. I followed all the protocols set forth by you in the relationship agreement. I made a written record request 72 hours in advance. I checked the tyre pressure on the car. I even contacted the Centres For Disease Control to find out what shots they recommend for travel to Orange County. FYI, it\u2019s none.\nSheldon: Amy, the relationship agreement was not designed for either one of us to get our way.\nAmy: You use it to get your way.\nSheldon: I use it to get the right way. The fact that the right way is also my way is a happy coincidence.\nAmy: You gave me your word. You\u2019re coming with me.\nLeonard: We\u2019ll miss you, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Yeah, well, who wants to spend the whole weekend, running around a bunch of pretend planets battling made up monsters. That\u2019s for babies.\nHoward: Yeah, but it\u2019s got lightsabres.\nSheldon: Yeah, please, Amy! It\u2019s got lightsabres!\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The comic book store.\nSheldon: Hello Stuart.\nStuart: Hey Sheldon. Help you with anything?\nSheldon: Yes. I\u2019m attending a party this weekend, for a 93-year-old woman. Can you recommend a gift?\nStuart: Uh, I don\u2019t know. Could put a tennis ball on the end of Excalibur. Make a pretty badass cane.\nSheldon: Do you supply the the tennis ball?\nStuart: No.\nSheldon: Then no. What else?\nStuart: Hmm. Oh, have this collectors edition Batman utility belt. Maybe she can use it as a wearable pill caddy.\nSheldon: Well, she\u2019d just look silly wearing that without the rest of the costume.\nStuart: I\u2019m sorry Sheldon, that\u2019s it. That\u2019s all I got.\nSheldon: Oh, it\u2019s not your fault. I\u2019ve been to the model train store. I\u2019ve been to Radio Shack. This woman is impossible to shop for.\nLeonard: I\u2019d make fun of Sheldon for having girl problems if I wasn\u2019t in shock that Sheldon has girl problems.\nSheldon: No, Leonard, go ahead and mock. Like my daddy always said, Shelly, women aren\u2019t anything but flippin\u2019 pains in the bottom.\nLeonard: That\u2019s what your father used to say?\nSheldon: Well, I took out the bad words and the yeehaw, but you get the gist.\nHoward: Look, if you don\u2019t want to go to the party, just don\u2019t go. You\u2019re a grown man. Act like one. Tell Amy you want to spend the weekend having a sleepover and playing video games with your friends. Maybe she\u2019ll dig it. Women like a firm hand on the tiller.\nRaj: I can never find the tiller. I got a book; it didn\u2019t help.\nSheldon: Yeah, I always thought if I were ever enslaved, it would be by an advanced species from another planet, not some hotsy-totsy from Glendale.\nHoward: Now, I downloaded an app that might be helpful in this situation. (Phone makes whip sound)\nSheldon: You\u2019re right. I\u2019m smart as a whip. I should be able to figure this out.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment.\nLeonard: Hey, listen, I kind of made plans with the guys this weekend, but then I wondered, because we\u2019re in this relationship-beta-test, if I should have asked you first. Then I thought if I did check with you first, you\u2019d think that I was taking things to seriously. And then, then I got a nosebleed.\nPenny: You don\u2019t have to check with me. Do whatever you want.\nLeonard: Oh. I guess I was hoping for a different reaction, but okay.\nPenny: Really, what were you hoping for?\nLeonard: I don\u2019t know, maybe that you\u2019d be a little upset, and then you\u2019d realize that I\u2019m a stallion that has to run free. And that would turn you on a little.\nPenny: Okay, I\u2019m an actress. Ask me again.\nLeonard: Do you mind if I spend the weekend playing video games with the guys?\nPenny: Whu\u2026 the entire weekend? You mean I wouldn\u2019t see you at all? But I ju\u2026 No, no, I knew what I was getting into. You can\u2019t put a saddle on Leonard Hofstadter. Oh, my, is it getting hot in here? Ay, papi.\nLeonard: Ay papi? What is that?\nPenny: An acting choice.\nLeonard: Oh. So you chose that when you become turned on, you turn into Speedy Gonzalez?\nPenny: Choo got a problem with that, papi?\nLeonard: Uh-uh.\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Penny! (Knock, knock, knock) Penny! (Knock, knock, knock) Penny!\nPenny: Sorry, Stallion. Your weird friend Giraffe is here.\nSheldon: Hello, Penny. I just stopped by to bring you this gift.\nPenny: Gummy bears? Thank you.\nSheldon: Now that you\u2019re in my debt, please manipulate Amy into releasing me from my commitment to attend her aunt\u2019s tedious birthday party.\nPenny: Not a chance.\nSheldon: All right. I thought the candy might not be enough so let me up the ante. These are Cooper Coupons. These are for various things I can do for you. Um, oh, this one is for one free grammar check. Uh, you could use it for emails, letters, tattoos, what have you. Um, oh, this is fun one. This is an afternoon with me at the California Science Center, where I point out their mistakes.\nLeonard: Keep an eye on those expiration dates, I\u2019ve been burned more than once.\nPenny: All right, sweetie, I\u2019m not going to get involved in your relationship.\nSheldon: Oh, come on. It\u2019s just a simple favour. Now, when\u2019s the last time I asked you to do something for me?\nPenny: Yesterday. You made me look in your ear to see if there was a ladybug in it.\nSheldon: When is the last time I asked you to do something that wasn\u2019t a medical emergency?\nPenny: Yesterday. You made me look in your ear to see if there was a ladybug in it.\nSheldon: All right, then, I have no choice but to go on to plan B.\nPenny: What\u2019s that?\nSheldon: I\u2019m going to run around outside with a wet head and try to catch a cold.\nScene: Amy\u2019s car.\nAmy: Good morning.\nSheldon: Hello.\nAmy: I think you\u2019re really going to enjoy yourself today. Not only do you get to meet my relatives, but since my aunt\u2019s nursing home is catering the party, all of the food is incredibly soft. It\u2019s like a vacation for your teeth.\nSheldon: All right.\nAmy: You sure you\u2019re okay with this?\nSheldon: Yes. I decided to find a way that I could have this experience and enjoy it.\nAmy: Thank you. That means a lot to me.\nSheldon: Oh, don\u2019t thank me. Thank wireless technology. I realized, I can go to your aunt\u2019s awful party and still spend the whole day gaming with my friends.\nAmy: Sheldon, my relatives are going to want to talk to you, and you\u2019re going to be sitting there playing a game? Isn\u2019t that a little rude?\nSheldon: Oh, I got that covered. Headset. I won\u2019t hear a word the old geezers are saying.\nAmy: You know, if playing that game is more important to you than honouring your commitment to me, and you don\u2019t mind me showing up at a party all by myself after I\u2019ve already told everybody I\u2019ll be bringing somebody, then, fine. Go home and play your game.\nSheldon: Thanks. Ooh, listen, I wouldn\u2019t mind a piece of birthday cake, provided the old gal\u2019s candle blow is clean and dry.\nScene: The apartment.\nRaj: Here you go. I\u2019ve got everything we\u2019ll need for the big game. Low fat turkey jerky, low-carb beer, 100-calorie snack packs.\nLeonard: You pick up a Y chromosome while you were there? You might be short one.\nRaj: Hey, I plan on levelling up in the game, not my swimsuit size, thank you very much.\nSheldon: Gentlemen, the game offers us a choice between playing for the Republic and the light side, or the Sith Empire and the dark side.\nLeonard: Well, we\u2019re always the good guys. In D&D, we\u2019re lawful good, in City Of Heroes, we\u2019re the heroes, in Grand Theft Auto, we pay the prostitutes promptly and never hit them with a bat.\nSheldon: Those women are prostitutes? You said they were raising money for stem cell research.\nHoward: Hey, guys, I got a surprise.\nLeonard: Uh, if it\u2019s yoghurt that helps ladies poop, I think Raj beat you to it.\nHoward: No. Bernadette\u2019s going to be playing with us. So, that\u2019s pretty cool, huh? Right? Sure it is, yeah.\nRaj: What, you invited your girlfriend? This is supposed to be our weekend.\nHoward: I had no choice. Last night, she said, why don\u2019t we go out for brunch tomorrow and then maybe the Arboretum. And I said, well, no, I promised the guys I was going to play a video game with them all weekend. And she said, that sounds like fun, can I come, too? And then I didn\u2019t answer for a second, and then she said, well, do you not want me to come? And then I bought her a new laptop and the game, and she\u2019s parking the car right now.\nSheldon: Is the whip sound app contextually appropriate here?\nLeonard: Uh, it is, but I think you might\u2019ve waited too long for it to be funny. (Whip sound) I was wrong, it\u2019s still funny.\nSheldon: Oh, good. Hah-hah!\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment.\nPenny: Amy, what\u2019s wrong?\nAmy: My boyfriend\u2019s a jerk.\nPenny: Well, I know he didn\u2019t cheat on you, so what happened?\nAmy: I had to go to my aunt\u2019s party all by myself, and everybody was like, where\u2019s this boyfriend you\u2019re always talking about? Is he real, or did you make him up like Armin the miniature horse breeder?\nPenny: Who\u2019s Armin the miniature horse breeder?\nAmy: The pretend boyfriend I invented to get my family off my back. It unravelled quickly when I couldn\u2019t answer the question how\u2019d you two meet?\nPenny: I would have thought at a miniature horse show.\nAmy: Oh, that\u2019s good.\nPenny: Mm.\nAmy: I panicked and said Woodstock. I just wanted to show Sheldon off to my family.\nPenny: Sure, I get that. I mean, he\u2019s your first boyfriend and all.\nAmy: Not just my first boyfriend, he\u2019s the best boyfriend. I mean, think about it. I\u2019m dating Sheldon Cooper.\nPenny: Yes. On purpose.\nAmy: He\u2019s handsome, he\u2019s lanky, he\u2019s brilliant, and his skin has that pale, waxy quality.\nPenny: Well, sickly is the new sexy.\nAmy: Yeah.\nPenny: Mm. You know, Amy, sometimes when you\u2019re in a relationship with someone you really care about, the sucky part is, it leaves you open to getting hurt.\nAmy: Do you ever worry about Leonard doing that to you?\nPenny: That\u2019s hilarious. No.\nScene: The apartment.\nBernadette: Get that guy! Get that guy! Pew! Pew! Pew! Pew!\nSheldon: Dr. Rostenkowski, it may interest you to know that saying pew, pew, pew isn\u2019t as effective as pressing your blaster key. In the same way that saying whee doesn\u2019t make the land speeder go.\nBernadette: Pew!\nLeonard: Raj, Imperial Troopers on your tail.\nRaj: Got him. When Gandhi advocated his philosophy of non-violence, I bet he didn\u2019t know how much fun it was killing stuff.\nLeonard: All right, I think we got them all. Let\u2019s divide up the loot.\nBernadette: Ooh, look at this pretty purple robe I just got. You should put on yours and then we\u2019ll match.\nHoward: But I worked hard to get this armour.\nBernadette: Sorry, I just thought it\u2019d be nice if people knew we were a couple.\nHoward: Fine, I\u2019ll change. (Whip sound) \nSheldon: Hah-hah!\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment.\nAmy: I don\u2019t think I want to play a game.\nPenny: Oh, come on. They\u2019re playing one across the hall, we should, too. Okay, we are gonna take turns bouncing a quarter off the table, and if it goes into this cup, the other person has to drink. Then you get to go again\u2026\nAmy: Like that?\nPenny: Wow. Yeah, b-beginner\u2019s luck. So, now I will drink this entire cup of beer, and you will go again and we can\u2026 uh\u2026 all right. So, yeah, okay, now I\u2019m gonna drink this entire cup and then I\u2019m going to drink another one\u2026 Okay, seriously, stop. What the hell?\nAmy: Spent a lot of my childhood throwing coins into wishing wells hoping for friends. At a certain point, you start doing trick shots just to keep things interesting.\nPenny: Whoa, whoa, give me a second to catch up here. Hold on. (Sound of cheering)\nAmy: That\u2019d be my boyfriend. Happier playing his dopey Star Trek game with his friends than hanging out with me.\nPenny: Wars.\nAmy: What?\nPenny: Star Wars. They get all cranky when you mix the two up.\nAmy: What\u2019s the difference?\nPenny: There\u2019s absolutely no difference.\nAmy: How do I get him to treat me better?\nPenny: All right. Let me give you a little girlfriend 101. Usually the first move out of the gate is you withhold sex, but that will work better after Sheldon hits puberty. So, I\u2019d say give him the silent treatment.\nAmy: No, he loves that.\nPenny: Hmm.\nAmy: Our record for sitting in a room together and not speaking to each other is six-and-a half hours. He said it was a magical evening.\nPenny: All right, then we\u2019re gonna have to go with an oldie but goodie, making a scene.\nAmy: I don\u2019t think I\u2019d be good at that.\nPenny: That\u2019s why you\u2019re lucky to have me. Back in Omaha, there are two different restaurants I\u2019m not allowed into. Both Chili\u2019s.\nScene: The apartment.\nRaj: Bernadette, remember, your character\u2019s the healer in our group. You\u2019re in charge of healing all of us, not just Howard.\nBernadette: I can\u2019t help it. My Howie Wowie has an owie.\nSheldon: That is the most sickeningly sweet thing I have ever experienced. And I am sipping Kool-Aid through a Red Vine.\nAmy (bursting in): Sheldon Cooper, I\u2019ve got a bone to pick with you, and I\u2019m about to do it in front of all your friends.\nPenny: Yeah, you pick that bone. You pick that bone clean!\nAmy: I\u2019m gonna publicly shame you, and then sit back as societal pressure compels you to modify your behaviour.\nPenny: Ooh, burn!\nAmy: And if you don\u2019t start treating me better, I\u2019m leaving you for a miniature horse breeder named Armin.\nSheldon: Armin who?\nAmy: Armin\u2026 damn it.\nPenny: Sheldon, she wanted to show you off to her family, and you stood her up, okay? Look at this adorable, smushy face. Smush, smush, smush, smush.\nAmy: You\u2019re hurting me.\nPenny: No, Sheldon hurt you.\nAmy: Before; now it\u2019s you.\nPenny: Oh.\nSheldon: I think I understand. You\u2019re the one person who can say Sheldon Cooper is your boyfriend, but that rings hollow if you can\u2019t lord him over others in the flesh. I forget what I bring to the party and what I take away when I leave. Please accept these valuable Cooper Coupons as restitution.\nPenny: Sheldon, she doesn\u2019t want your stupid\u2026\nAmy: Ooh, Science Center. Redeeming. Let\u2019s go.\nSheldon: Well played, Amy Farrah Fowler. Let me get my coat. (Whip sound) Oh, grow up, Leonard.\nRaj: But e-excuse me, I have something to say. None of you may realize it, but I was very much looking forward to this weekend. It was gonna be like the old days, the four of us hanging out playing video games before you guys all got girlfriends. Do you have any idea what it\u2019s like to be the only one without a girlfriend? Even if I get one someday, I\u2019ll still be the guy who got a girl after Sheldon Cooper!\nPenny: And that\u2019s how a girl makes a scene. I\u2019m sorry, sweetie. You\u2019re right. You deserve your weekend. Come on, Amy, let\u2019s go.\nAmy: What about the Science Center?\nPenny: I\u2019ll let you hold my hair while I throw up.\nAmy: Rain check.\nBernadette: I\u2019m gonna go, too.\nHoward: I\u2019ll miss you.\nBernadette: I\u2019ll miss you.\nHoward: I\u2019ll miss you more.\nBernadette: No, I\u2019ll\u2026\nRaj: Just leave! Okay, now. This is the way it\u2019s supposed to be. Men together, fighting the forces of evil.\nAll: Hear! Hear!\nRaj: I can\u2019t believe this is only 64 calories.\nScene: Some time later. The guys are asleep.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Howard Joel Wolowitz! I\u2019ve been worried sick for two days, and I know you turned off your phone! You open up this door right now because I\u2019ve had it up to here! I have been to the morgue and the hospital, and I spent the last half hour walking up these ferkakta stairs!\nHoward: That\u2019s my ride, got to go. (Whip sound)\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "4_13": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The Cheesecake Factory\nPenny: Hey. So you guys ready to order?\nSheldon: Since we come in every Tuesday night at six o\u2019clock and order the same exact thing, and it\u2019s now six oh eight, I believe your question not only answers itself but also stands alongside such other nonsensical queries as who let the dogs out? and, uh, How are they hanging?\nPenny: Okay. So, the usual, with extra spit on Sheldon\u2019s hamburger.\nAmy: Penny, a moment? Do you have plans this weekend?\nPenny: Oh, gee, Amy, I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m actually pretty busy this weekend.\nSheldon: Probably serving food that was ordered today.\nAmy: That\u2019s too bad. I was hoping you could be my plus-one at the Institute of Interdisciplinary Studies\u2019 symposium on the impact of current scientific research on societal interactions.\nPenny: The what?\nLeonard: It\u2019s an annual science conference. We\u2019ve all been invited to speak.\nPenny: Oh. Oh, okay, well, you know, like I said, I have plans, so.\nAmy: Shame. Since you\u2019re my best friend, I thought it would be a good bonding opportunity.\nPenny: I\u2019m your best friend?\nAmy: Don\u2019t you read my blog?\nPenny: Oh, don\u2019t feel bad. I never read Leonard\u2019s, and I used to sleep with him.\nAmy: Do you know anybody else who would appreciate an all-expense-paid spa weekend at a four-star resort in Big Sur?\nPenny: No, I really, I\u2019m sorry, free what? Sorry, what, what?\nLeonard: I think her weekend just opened up.\nPenny: Wait, wait, just to be clear, when you guys say spa, does that mean the same thing as when regular people say it?\nLeonard: Pretty much. Except we keep our shirts on in the sauna.\nPenny: You know, it is going to be difficult, but I\u2019m going to cancel my plans so I can do this for my bestie.\nAmy: Please don\u2019t touch my breasts.\nPenny: I, I wasn\u2019t going to.\nAmy: All right. I just want to establish boundaries.\nPenny: Boy, this is great. I haven\u2019t had a vacation in ages.\nSheldon: In order to take a vacation, one first has to work.\nPenny: You know, for a smart guy, you really seem to have a hard time grasping the concept, don\u2019t piss off the people who handle the things you eat.\nAmy: That does seem to be a valid principle.\nSheldon: I trust Penny will adhere to the Official California Restaurant Workers\u2019 Solemn Oath of Ethics and Cleanliness.\u201d\nAmy: I don\u2019t believe there\u2019s any such thing.\nSheldon: You lied to me?\nCredits sequence.\n \nScene: The apartment.\n \nSheldon: Good morning. If I could have everyone\u2019s attention, please? I know we\u2019re all eager to get on the road to Big Sur, so if we focus, I\u2019m sure we can get through this orientation in under a half an hour. Then it\u2019s just Q&A, quiz, safety drills, pose for commemorative group photo and we\u2019re off.\nLeonard: Don\u2019t worry. Just sit next to me during the quiz, and you can copy my answers.\nSheldon: Raj? What are you doing? I don\u2019t think so. You\u2019ve had your allotted six ounces. The first bathroom break isn\u2019t until the Denny\u2019s located near Bakersfield, which is approximately two and half hours away. Remember, people, we\u2019re only as strong as our weakest bladder.\nHoward (after Raj whispers to him): Nobody cares about your Kegel exercises.\nSheldon: All right. We have seven people, and two cars. In the lead car, driven by Leonard, will be myself, Amy Farrah Fowler and Penny.\nAmy: Yes! He had you in the other car, but I got you upgraded.\nPenny: Yay!\nSheldon: She made the case that if we break down in the middle of nowhere, your Nebraska backwoods skills and brawny hands will give us the best chance to survive in the wild.\nPenny: Brawny?\nLeonard: They\u2019re bigger than mine.\nScene: Leonard\u2019s car. \nSheldon: Red Leader to Red Five, come in. Red Leader to Red Five, come in. Howard, you promised.\nHoward (voice): Fine. \u00a0Red Five to Red Leader. What do you want now?\nSheldon: It\u2019s eleven fifteen. I\u2019m requesting your quarter-hourly location update.\nHoward: Still right behind you.\nSheldon: Copy that, Red Five. Radio contact is sufficient. No need to extend your middle finger.\nPenny: So, Amy, I\u2019ve been wondering, are you and Sheldon going to be sharing a room?\nAmy: No, we discussed it. We decided we didn\u2019t want to jeopardize our relationship by getting to know each other too well.\nSheldon: Indeed. Nothing sours a friendship more than over-familiarity with someone\u2019s toilet routine.\nLeonard: I can vouch for that.\nPenny: Hey.\nLeonard: Not you, him.\nPenny: Oh. Thanks.\nLeonard: Although yours was an eye-opener.\nAmy: Don\u2019t worry, Penny. You\u2019re my plus-one. You\u2019ll bunk with me. And FYI, travel makes me constipated, so I\u2019m the ideal hotel roommate.\nPenny: Terrific. Are we there yet?\nScene: Bernadette\u2019s car. \nBernadette: I hope we get there in time to see the keynote address.\nHoward: Really? You want to see the keynote?\nBernadette: Yeah, it sounds fun. Super bacteria: global apocalypse or exciting research opportunity?\nHoward: Actually, I was thinking we could go straight to the room and take a nap.\nBernadette: Really? And miss the keynote?\nHoward: We can watch it later on C-SPAN. Besides, I was really looking forward to you and me napping together in the hotel.\nBernadette: Well honey, if you\u2019re that tired, why don\u2019t you just take a nap here in the car?\nHoward: No, see, it\u2019s not\u2026\nBernadette: Hang on. It\u2019s Leonard. Hi, Leonard.\nLeonard (voice): Yeah, hi. Listen, I just got a text from Raj. He wanted me to tell you that when Howard says nap, he means sex.\nBernadette: Oh. Thank you, Raj.\nScene: Leonard\u2019s car. \nLeonard: Are you an element in the actinoid series?\nSheldon: No. Amy?\nAmy: Are you usually radioactive when found in nature?\nSheldon: No.\nAmy: Are you in the lanthanoid series?\nSheldon: Amy, it\u2019s Penny\u2019s turn. Penny?\nPenny: Uh, I don\u2019t know. Are you food?\nSheldon: That\u2019s not apropos. We\u2019ve already established I\u2019m found in the periodic table.\nPenny: Well, it\u2019s a table, right? I mean, why can\u2019t there be food on it?\nSheldon: I knew she wasn\u2019t lead car material.\nPenny: Who elected you Road Trip God?\nSheldon: Leonard.\nLeonard: It was a late-night vote. We were all exhausted, and he was threatening to filibuster. It\u2019s not technically Road Trip God, it\u2019s Travel Supervisor.\nSheldon: Although Road Trip God does have a certain ring to it.\nPenny: I don\u2019t understand why you people just let him bully you like this. Someone should stand up to him. What\u2019s he going to do?\nScene: Bernadette\u2019s car. \nPenny: I can\u2019t believe you let him kick me out of the car.\nHoward: What could we do? He\u2019s the Travel Supervisor.\nBernadette: Don\u2019t worry, Penny. This is a better car anyway.\nHoward: Yeah. It\u2019s the Love Car.\nPenny: Should I ask?\nBernadette (singing): They say we\u2019re young and we don\u2019t know, we won\u2019t find out until we grow.\nHoward (singing): Well, I don\u2019t know if all that\u2019s true, \u2019cause you got me, and, baby, I got you.\nTogether (singing): Babe, mm da-da, da-da, da-da, I got you, babe, da-da, da-da, da-da, I got you, babe\u2026\nPenny: Red Leader, I\u2019m really sorry.\nScene: The hotel. \nHoward and Bernadette (singing): I got you, babe.\nAmy: I missed you.\nPenny: You know what? I missed you, too.\nVery tall and powerfully built man: Bernadette?\nBernadette: Oh, my God, Glenn!\nGlenn: Great to see you!\nBernadette: Are you here for the conference?\nGlenn: Yeah, I\u2019m doing a global warming panel.\nBernadette: Oh, good for you. Uh, Glenn, this is my boyfriend Howard.\nGlenn: Oh. Nice to meet you.\nHoward: Hi. Ow. Hi.\nGlenn: You\u2019re a lucky man. Bernie\u2019s a great gal.\nHoward: Yes. Bernie sure is.\nGlenn: Well, I got to run. The panel\u2019s tomorrow morning. It\u2019s called, Remembering Snow: A Look Back.\nBernadette: I\u2019ll try to catch it.\nGlenn: Oh, great. Bye.\nBernadette: Bye.\nHoward: Hey, Bernie?\nBernadette: Yeah?\nHoward: Please tell me he\u2019s your gay cousin.\nBernadette: No. He was one of my professors in college.\nHoward: Oh! That\u2019s a relief.\nBernadette: Then we went out for a year. Come on, let\u2019s check in, so we can take that nap.\nHoward (after Raj whispers to him): No, it\u2019s not necessarily proportional. Shut up!\nScene: Howard\u2019s hotel room.\nHoward: That green bag is Dr. Cooper\u2019s. Here\u2019s an extra five. Make him wait. Oh. Right to the nap, huh? Okay? Uh, so, this Glenn guy. You say you went out with him for, like, a year.\nBernadette: Do we really need to talk about my old boyfriend now?\nHoward: No. I guess not. What is he, like, six-four, six-five?\nBernadette: Six-seven.\nHoward: Probably has a hard time finding a suit that fits.\nBernadette: Is something bothering you?\nHoward: No. It\u2019s just\u2026\nBernadette: What?\nHoward: I\u2019m just thinking. If you had sex with that guy, I mean, there\u2019s nothing I can do here that will make any kind of impact.\nBernadette: Howard, it\u2019s not a contest. I love you. I want to be with you.\nHoward: Yeah, great, love you, too, but, if it were a contest, I wouldn\u2019t have a chance, right?\nBernadette: You can\u2019t think that way.\nHoward: Yep. Loser.\nBernadette: Howard, stop it.\nHoward: Sorry. I just never figured that a guy like me going out with a girl like you would ever have to compete with a guy like that.\nBernadette: Wait a minute, a girl like me? What\u2019s that mean?\nHoward: I\u2019m\u2026 I\u2026\nBernadette: Are you saying you don\u2019t think I\u2019m hot enough to go out with a guy like Glenn?\nHoward: No! No, I\u2019m saying exactly the opposite.\nBernadette: I\u2019m too hot to go out with a guy like Glenn?\nHoward: Yeah, let\u2019s go with that.\nScene: Amy\u2019s hotel room.\nAmy (exiting bathroom): Still nothing. Remind me to try again in an hour.\nPenny: Will do.\nAmy: So, girl talk?\nPenny: Um, sure. What do you, what do you got in mind?\nAmy: Do you subscribe to the Freudian theory of penis envy?\nPenny: Um, I never really thought about it. Why?\nAmy: Sometimes I think it might be nice to have one.\nPenny: Really?\nAmy: Not for sex, for convenience. You can\u2019t deny that, by comparison, our internal plumbing is extremely high maintenance.\nPenny: Again, I\u2019ve never given it much thought.\nAmy: We have time now. Think about it.\nPenny (knock on door): Oh, good. Hey.\nBernadette: Can I stay here tonight?\nPenny: Yeah. Why, what happened?\nBernadette: Howard\u2019s a complete and total ass.\nPenny: Oh, yeah, that. Come on in.\nBernadette: Thanks. I\u2019ll sleep on the floor.\nAmy: Not necessary. Penny and I are perfectly comfortable sharing a bed.\nPenny: We are?\nAmy: Of course, we\u2019re best friends.\nPenny: Oh, right, right, the blog.\nAmy: Word of warning, though. I\u2019m prone to night terrors, so if I wake up kicking and screaming, don\u2019t panic. Just pin me down and stroke my hair, and I\u2019ll be fine.\nScene: Leonard\u2019s room. \nPenny: Hey, can I stay here tonight?\nLeonard: Shh-shh-shh-shh. Sheldon\u2019s asleep. What\u2019s going on?\nPenny: Well, Howard\u2019s a complete and total ass, Bernadette\u2019s in my bed, and no matter how much you stroke Amy\u2019s hair, she bites.\nLeonard: What?\nPenny: Never mind. Can I stay here or not?\nLeonard: Uh, sure.\nPenny: All right.\nLeonard: So, how do you wanna do this?\nPenny: Well, I\u2019m not getting in bed with him.\nLeonard: Yeah, it is a little like getting into Dracula\u2019s coffin.\nPenny: We\u2019re just gonna have to make the best of this.\nLeonard: Okay, when you say make the best of it.\nPenny: Sleep.\nLeonard: Right. So we\u2019ll just call the middle here the Neutral Zone.\nPenny: The what?\nLeonard: Star Trek. You know, the Neutral Zone between the Federation and the Romulan Empire.\nPenny: Oh, okay. Just like old times.\nLeonard: Of course, sometimes the Federation and the Romulans would enter the Neutral Zone to negotiate a temporary truce.\nPenny: Sweetie, let me put this in a way you\u2019ll understand. From the waist down, my shields are up.\nLeonard: Got it, got it. We can do all kinds of stuff from the waist up, you know?\nPenny: Go to sleep.\nLeonard: Good night.\nSheldon: Please tell me you\u2019re not having coitus.\nPenny: We are not having coitus.\nSheldon: Can you guarantee that it won\u2019t happen at any time during the night?\nPenny: Yes.\nLeonard: No.\nScene: Raj\u2019s room.\nTV Announcer: Next on Turner Classic Movies, Bridget Jones\u2019s Diary.\nRaj: Oh, my God, I\u2019m crying already.\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Raj? (Knock, knock, knock) Raj? (Knock, knock, knock) Raj? I need to sleep here tonight.\nRaj: Why?\nSheldon: Howard is a complete and total ass, Bernadette is in Penny\u2019s bed, Amy bites, and Penny may or may not have coitus with Leonard.\nRaj: Okay. Come on in.\nScene: Leonard\u2019s room. \nPenny: Leonard, are you asleep?\nLeonard: No.\nPenny: I really appreciate you letting me stay here tonight.\nLeonard: Sure, no problem.\nPenny: I know it\u2019s kinda weird.\nLeonard: True dat.\nPenny: True dat?\nLeonard: I\u2019ve gotten a lot more street since we broke up.\nPenny: Right. Still mad at me about that?\nLeonard: No. No, I understand. I got too intense, you had to back off.\nPenny: Thank you.\nLeonard: I\u2019ve gotten a lot better at that, you know. I\u2019ve dated four different women since we broke up and I didn\u2019t tell any of them that I loved them and wanted to have their babies.\nPenny: Good for you.\nLeonard: Okay, good night.\nPenny: Good night. You know, maybe it wouldn\u2019t be the worst idea in the world to violate the Neutral Zone for just one night. Oh!\nRaj: Hey, Leonard, Sheldon kicked me out of the room, gave me your key.\nLeonard: Penny\u2019s here. (Raj whispers to him) No, we don\u2019t want to watch Bridget Jones\u2019s Diary!\nScene: A conference room.\nSheldon: Good morning and welcome to Science and Society. I\u2019m Dr. Sheldon Cooper, BS, MS, MA, PhD, and ScD. OMG, right? Perhaps that joke was a little too hippie-dippy for this crowd. All right then, we\u2019ll begin with opening remarks. Miss Rostenkowski, would you like to start us off by discussing your assessment of science\u2019s responsibility to society?\nBernadette: Sure. I think all branches of science have to move cautiously these days. It\u2019s not just giant nuclear weapons that can destroy the world. As a microbiologist, I can tell you even the tiniest organisms can still tear you a new one.\nHoward: Interesting. I think what you might need to know about my colleague is that though she claims her field of interest\u00a0 is tiny organisms, she certainly has spent her fair share of time around what we can assume was pretty massive weaponry.\nBernadette: I think Mr. Wolowitz needs to keep in mind that the past is the past. But he should know that I am the kind of girl who could get all the giant missiles she wants.\nAmy: Are we talking about women wanting penises? Because I\u2019d like to weigh in.\nSheldon: Dr. Koothrappali, would you care to join the conversation?\nRaj: Certainly. I\u2019d like to raise two points. Number one, I think they are talking about penises. And number two, these mimosas are kicking my little brown ass.\nLeonard: I\u2019d like to kick your little brown ass.\nRaj: What did I do?\nLeonard: Oh, I don\u2019t know. Maybe when you walk into a hotel room and you see a guy getting back together with his girlfriend, you should consider doing something other than crawling into the adjoining bed.\nRaj: I did. You said no Bridget Jones.\nPenny (voice): We weren\u2019t getting back together! It was a one-time thing!\nSheldon: Excuse me. We\u2019re not taking comments or questions from the audience just yet.\nPenny(voice): Oh, shut up, Sheldon!\nAmy: Hi, bestie.\nPenny(voice): Yeah, hi.\nSheldon: All right, why don\u2019t we see if we can bring this back to topic.\nHoward: Let me ask you something, Bernie.\nSheldon: I guess not.\nHoward: How would you feel if you met my ex-girlfriend and she was like Angelina Jolie?\nBernadette: Oh, come on, Howard, be realistic.\nHoward: What, I\u2019m not hot enough for Angelina Jolie?\nRaj: I\u2019d like to weigh in here. No.\nSheldon: All right, why don\u2019t we open it up to Q&A from the audience?\nPenny (voice): Yeah, I have a question. Is there anybody who can get me the hell out of here and back to Los Angeles tonight?\nGlenn (voice): I\u2019m driving back to L.A. tonight.\nBernadette: Um, Penny, that\u2019s Glenn. Glenn, that\u2019s Penny.\nLeonard: No!\nScene: Bernadette\u2019s car. \nSheldon (voice): Red Leader to Red Five. Red Leader to Red Five. Anybody up for a little game? I spy with my little eye, a nonferrous metal. (Howard throws walkie-talkie out of window)\nScene: Leonard\u2019s car. \nSheldon: Must be out of range.\nAmy: Leonard, can I ask you a question?\nLeonard: Sure.\nAmy: Are you bothered by the fact that your former girlfriend left the symposium with what is probably the most beautiful man I\u2019ve ever seen in my life?\nLeonard: No. Why do you ask?\nAmy: Because we\u2019re going 120 miles per hour.\nSheldon: All right, if no one\u2019s going to guess, I was spying the aluminium rims on the police car we passed a few miles back.\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "1_15": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: A corridor at the University.\nLeonard: On the other hand, some physicists are concerned that if the super collider actually works, it will create a black hole and swallow up the Earth ending life as we know it. \nRaj: Psh, what a bunch of crybabies. No guts, no glory man. \nLeonard (looking at an orange notice on the noticeboard): Hey, check it out, the school of pharmacology is looking for volunteers.\nRaj: We are testing a new medication for social anxiety, panic attacks, agoraphobia and obsessive compulsive disorder. Why would they be looking for test subjects here? \nLeonard: I don\u2019t know, Raj. Maybe the comic book store doesn\u2019t have a bulletin board. (Sees crowds in the corridor) What\u2019s going on?\nHoward: Shhh! Hot girl in Sheldon\u2019s office. \nLeonard: Sheldon\u2019s office? Is she lost? \nHoward: Don\u2019t think so. I followed her here from the parking lot. \nLeonard: Maybe she\u2019s his lawyer.\nHoward: Well she\u2019s free to examine my briefs.\nLeonard: Howard\u2026\nHoward: I know, I\u2019m disgusting, I should be punished. By her, oh look, I did it again. \nGirl: Well, that should do it.\nSheldon: Thank you for coming by. (He rises from his desk. Everyone rushes to look nonchalant.) Hello.\nLeonard: Oh, hey buddy. \nSheldon: Buddy.\nHoward: Sorry I\u2019m late, I\u2019m working on a project that may take me up on the next space shuttle.\nSheldon: How can you be late, I wasn\u2019t expecting you at all. \nHoward: Nobody ever expects me, sometimes you just look and\u2026 BAM! (shakes girl\u2019s hand) Howard Wolowitz. \nLeonard: Sheldon, are you going to introduce us? \nSheldon: Oh, alright, this is Missy, Missy this is Leonard and Rajesh and you\u2019ve already met Howard. \nMissy: It\u2019s nice to meet you.\nLeonard: You too, swell, also.\nHoward: Yeah. \nLeonard: So, how do you two know each other.\nMissy: Oh, he once spent nine months with my legs wrapped around his head. \nLeonard: Excuse me?\nSheldon: She\u2019s my twin sister, she thinks she\u2019s funny but frankly I\u2019ve never been able to see it.\nMissy: It\u2019s because you have no measurable sense of humour, Shelly.\nSheldon: How exactly would one measure a sense of humour? A humourmometer? \nHoward: Well, I think you\u2019re delightfully droll. Or as the French say, Tres Drole. \nMissy: Okay, so let me see if I got this. Leonard, Howard and\u2026 I\u2019m sorry what was your name again. (Raj looks uncomfortable, turns and walks away, disappears round corner. He then reappears, takes the orange paper from the noticeboard and leaves again.)\nSheldon: Rajesh. \nCredits sequence\nScene: The same.\nLeonard: So Missy, what brings you all the way from Texas? \nHoward: Was it perhaps destiny, I think it was destiny. \nMissy: My friend\u2019s getting married in Disneyland tomorrow night. \nHoward: Destiny, thy name is Anaheim. \nMissy: And I had to drop off some papers for Shelly to sign for my dad\u2019s estate.\nSheldon: The papers could have been mailed, Mom just sent you here to spy on me, didn\u2019t she.\nMissy: I guess that\u2019s why they call you a genius. \nSheldon: They call me a genius because I\u2019m a genius. Tell Mom that I currently weigh 165 pounds, and that I\u2019m having regular bowel movements. Enjoy the wedding, goodbye.\nLeonard and Howard together: Woah, woah. \nLeonard: If the wedding\u2019s not until tomorrow, why don\u2019t you stay with us tonight? \nMissy: Oh, I don\u2019t think so. Shelly doesn\u2019t like company. Even as a little boy he\u2019d send his imaginary friends home at the end of the day. \nSheldon: They were not friends, they were imaginary colleagues. \nLeonard: Look, you\u2019re here, we have plenty of room.\nSheldon: No we don\u2019t.\nHoward: Come on, Shelly, she\u2019s family.\nSheldon: So what? I don\u2019t issue invitations to your mother.\nMissy: Well it would be nice not to have to drive out to Anaheim in rush hour.\nSheldon: And don\u2019t ever call me Shelly.\nLeonard: So it\u2019s settled. You\u2019ll stay with us.\nHoward: I\u2019ll walk you to your car. You\u2019re in structure 3 level C, right? \nSheldon: What just happened?\nScene: The apartment.\nMissy: So anyway, we\u2019re eight years old, and Sheldon converts my easy-bake oven to some kind of high-powered furnace.\nLeonard: Hee-hee, just classic. \nSheldon: I needed a place to fire ceramic semi-conductor substrates for home-made integrated circuits. \nMissy: He was trying to build some kind of armed robot to keep me out of his room.\nSheldon: Made necessary by her insistence on going into my room.\nMissy: Anyway, I go to make those little corn muffins they give you, there\u2019s a big flash, next thing you know my eyebrows are gone.\nHoward: Ha-ha, not your eyebrows? \nMissy: Yep. I had to go through the entire second grade with crooked eyebrows my Mom drew on.\nSheldon: Is that what that was? I just assumed that the second grade curriculum had rendered you quizzical. \nPenny (knocking and entering, holding up a pair of superman undershorts.): Hey, Leonard, you left your underwear in the dryer downstairs. \nLeonard: Those are not mine.\nPenny: Really, they have your little name label in them. \nLeonard: Yeah, no, I do, I use those\u2026 uh\u2026 just to polish up my\u2026 spear-fishing equipment. I spear fish. When I\u2019m not crossbow hunting, I spear fish. Uh, Penny, this is Sheldon\u2019s twin sister, Missy. Missy, this is our neighbour Penny.\nMissy: Hi. \nPenny: Wow, you don\u2019t look that much alike.\nHoward: Can I get a hallelujah. \nSheldon: Fraternal twins come from two separate eggs, they are no more alike than any other siblings.\nHoward: Hallelujah. \nRaj (running in): Hey, guess what. I\u2019ve been accepted as a test subject for a new miracle drug to overcome pathological shyness. \nPenny: Hey, good for you, Raj.\nRaj: Yes, I\u2019m very hopeful. Hello Missy. (He waves his hand. It keeps waving.) They mentioned there may be side effects. \nScene: The same, later.\nRaj: So, Missy. Have you ever met a man from the exotic subcontinent of India? \nMissy: Well, there\u2019s Dr Patel at our church. \nRaj: Ah yes, Dr Patel, good man.\nHoward: Do you like motorcycles, \u2018cos I ride a hog. \nRaj: A hog? You have a two cylinder scooter with a basket on the front. \nHoward: You still have to wear a helmet. \nRaj: Have you ever heard of the Kama Sutra? \nMissy: The sex book?\nRaj: The Indian sex book. In other words if you wonder wonder who wrote the book of love, it was us.\nPenny (to Leonard): Hey, Sheldon\u2019s sister\u2019s pretty cute, I w\u2026.\nLeonard: I wasn\u2019t staring! \nPenny: I didn\u2019t say you were, I just said she was cute. \nLeonard: Oh. Huh, um, maybe, if you like women who are tall\u2026 and perfect. \nPenny: Sheldon, why are you ignoring your sister?\nSheldon: I\u2019m not ignoring my sister. I\u2019m ignoring all of you. \nLeonard: I brought snacks.\nMissy: Oh my! Gherkins and\u2026.\nLeonard: Onion dip, it\u2019s onion dip. \nMissy: Oh.\nLeonard: We don\u2019t entertain much. \nRaj: Missy, do you enjoy pajamas?\nMissy: I guess. \nRaj: We Indians invented them. You\u2019re welcome.\nHoward: Yeah, well my people invented circumcision. You\u2019re welcome!\nPenny: Missy, I\u2019m going to go get my nails done. Do you want to come?\nMissy: God yes. Thanks.\nPenny: You\u2019re welcome. \nMissy: Bye guys.\nHoward: Bye Missy.\nLeonard: Bye Missy, see you.\nPenny: Goodbye Leonard! \nLeonard: Uh, yeah, no, uh, bye Penny.\nHoward: Okay, you two have to back off.\nRaj: Why should I back off, you back off dude.\nLeonard: Excuse me, this is my apartment and she\u2019s my roommate\u2019s sister.\nHoward: So what, you\u2019ve already got Penny. \nLeonard: How do I have Penny? In what universe do I have Penny?\nHoward: So I can have Penny?\nLeonard: Hell, no! \nSheldon: Excuse me, can I interject something. I\u2019m ordering pizza online, is everyone okay with pepperoni? \nLeonard: Sheldon, can I talk to you in private?\nSheldon: I guess. Don\u2019t worry, I was going to order you cheeseless.\nLeonard: Thank you. \nSheldon: That\u2019s okay. Lactose intolerance is nothing to be embarrassed about. \nHoward: I\u2019m a fancy Indian man, we invented pajamas! \nRaj: Hey, look at me, I don\u2019t have a foreskin. \nScene: Sheldon\u2019s bedroom.\nLeonard: Sheldon, are you aware that your sister is an incredibly attractive woman?\nSheldon: Hmmm? She certainly has the symmetry and low body fat that western culture deems desirable. It\u2019s noteworth that at other points in history, heavier women were the standard for beauty because their girth suggested affluence. \nLeonard: That\u2019s fascinating, but I\u2026\nSheldon: I didn\u2019t say it was fascinating, I said it was noteworthy.\nLeonard: Alright, noted. But my point is that Koothrappali and Wolowitz\u2026 they\u2019re hitting on your sister. \nSheldon: Oh. Okay. You know, I don\u2019t want to criticise your rhetorical style but, we\u2019d be a lot further along in this conversation if you\u2019d begun with that thought. \nLeonard: That\u2019s great, but I\u2026.\nSheldon: What I\u2019m saying is that we took quite an unnecessary detour from what I now understand to be your thesis.\nLeonard: Whatever. You have to do something about it.\nSheldon: Why?\nLeonard: Because she\u2019s your sister. \nSheldon: I don\u2019t understand. Yes, we shared a uterus for nine months, but since then we\u2019ve pretty much gone our own separate ways. \nLeonard: Okay, uh\u2026. oh, consider this. With your father gone, it is your responsibility to make sure that Missy chooses a suitable mate. \nSheldon: I hadn\u2019t considered that. We do share DNA.\nLeonard: Uh-huh. \nSheldon: So there is the possibility, however remote, that resting in her loins is the potential for another individual as remarkable as myself. \nLeonard: Exactly. And, you owe it to yourself and to posterity to protect the genetic integrity of your sister\u2019s future offspring. \nSheldon: You\u2019re right. If someone wants to get at Missy\u2019s fallopian tubes, they\u2019ll have to go through me. \nScene: The living room. Raj and Howard are on the floor, fighting. \nRaj: I am Shiva the destroyer, I will have the woman! \nHoward: I\u2019m warning you, I was judo champion at math camp. \nSheldon: Alright, that\u2019s enough juvenile squabbling, stop it, stop it I say. I\u2019m going to settle this right now. Neither of you are good enough for my sister. \nHoward: Who are you to decide that?\nLeonard: He\u2019s the man of his family, you have to respect his wishes.\nSheldon: You\u2019re out too, by the way.\nLeonard: Say what?\nSheldon: It\u2019s nothing personal, I\u2019d just prefer if my future niece or nephew didn\u2019t become flatulent every time they eat an Eskimo pie. \nHoward (to Raj, who is smiling): What are you so happy about?\nRaj: I\u2019m not happy, it\u2019s the medication, I can\u2019t stop smiling. (Waves hand at mouth. It keeps waving.)\nSheldon: Now that Leonard\u2019s made me aware of how high the genetic stakes are, we have to face the fact that none of you are suitable mates for my sister. \nHoward: Wait a minute. Leonard made you aware of that? \nLeonard: We all make mistakes, let\u2019s move on. \nRaj: Excuse me, but I think you\u2019re missing a big opportunity here. \nSheldon: How so?\nRaj: Everybody knows genetic diversity produces the strongest offspring. Why not put a little mocha in the family latte. \nSheldon: In principle you have a point, but as a practical matter, need I remind you that it takes experimental pharmaceuticals to simply enable you to speak to the opposite sex.\nRaj (waving finger at him): I think you\u2019re focussing entirely too much on the drugs. (Finger keeps waving. Leonard has to reach out and stop it.)\nHoward: Is it \u2018cause I\u2019m Jewish, \u2018cause I\u2019d kill my Rabbi with a porkchop to be with your sister.\nSheldon: This has nothing to do with religion. This has to do with the fact that you\u2019re a tiny, tiny man who still lives with his mother. \nLeonard: Sheldon, you are really being unreasonable. \nSheldon: Am I? Here. Eat this cheese without farting and you can sleep with my sister. \nMissy (who has just entered): Oh really? \nSheldon: Oops. \nMissy: Shelly, can I speak to you for a minute? Alone? \nSheldon: Why does everyone suddenly want to talk to me alone? Usually nobody wants to be alone with me. \u00a0\u00a0\nLeonard (to Penny who is standing next to him grinning): We all make mistakes, let\u2019s move on.\nScene: Sheldon\u2019s bedroom.\nMissy: Okay. I\u2019m not even going to ask why you\u2019re pimping me out for cheese. But since when do you care at all about who I sleep with? \nSheldon: Truthfully, I\u2019ve never given it any thought, but it has been pointed out to me that you carry DNA of great potential.\nMissy: What on earth are you talking about? \nSheldon: Let me explain. You see, I\u2019m a superior genetic mutation, an improvement on the existing mediocre stock. \nMissy: And what do you mean, mediocre stock? \nSheldon: That would be you. But residing within you is the potential for another me. Perhaps even taller, smarter and less prone to freckling, a Sheldon 2.0 if you will. \nMissy: Sheldon 2.0?\nSheldon: Exactly. Now, I am not saying that I should be the sole decider of who you mate with. If you\u2019re not attracted to the suitor then the likelihood of conception would be reduced.\nMissy: You have got to be kidding me! \nSheldon: Not at all. Frequent coitus dramatically increases the odds of fertiliziation. \nMissy: Okay Shelly, sit down. Now I\u2019ve lived my whole life dealing with the fact that my twin brother is, as Mom puts it, one of God\u2019s special little people. \nSheldon: I always thought I was more like a cuckoo bird. You know, a superior creature whose egg is placed in the nest of ordinary birds. Of course the newly hatched cuckoo eats all the food, leaving the ordinary siblings to starve to death. Luckily for you, that\u2019s where the metaphor ended. \nMissy: I thought it ended at cuckoo. Now you listen to me, if you want to start acting like a brother who cares about me, then terrific. Bring it on. But you try one time to tell me who I should be sleeping with, and you and I are going to go round and round the way we did when we were little. Remember? (Sheldon hurriedly crosses his legs.) \nSheldon: I have an alternate proposal. \nMissy: Go on.\nSheldon: You donate eggs. We will place them in cryogenic storage. I will find an appropriate sperm donor for your eggs, have them fertilized and implanted in you, that way everybody wins. \nScene: The living room. Sheldon enters limping, holding his groin area. \nSheldon: Correction. Missy can date whoever she wants. \nScene: The same, later. \nHoward: Look, we have to settle this.\nLeonard: I agree. Sheldon\u2019s sister is hiding at Penny\u2019s because we\u2019ve all been hitting on her at the same time. \nRaj: She\u2019s not hiding. She needed privacy to call her grandmother who\u2019s apparently very sick. Oh, and then I believe she has to wash her hair. \nHoward: Oh, you poor, deluded bastard. \nRaj: Don\u2019t start with me dude.\nHoward: You want to go again? Let\u2019s go. \nLeonard: Sit down.\nHoward: Okay. \nLeonard: If we\u2019re going to fight over Missy, let\u2019s do it the right way. The honourable way.\n(Time shift. Sheldon enters to hear sounds of fighting. It becomes apparent that the guys are playing a boxing game on a Nintendo Wii.)\nLeonard: And he\u2019s down!\nHoward: Come on, come on, get up. \nLeonard: Stay down, bitch. Yeah, ha ha, natural selection at work.\nSheldon: I weep for humanity. \nLeonard: Excuse me while I go tell Missy the good news. (Leaves and knocks on Penny\u2019s door.)\nPenny (answering): Ah, hey Leonard.\nLeonard: Hi Penny, how\u2019s it going. Listen, that guy Mike that you were dating, is that still going on?\nPenny: Uh, pretty much, why?\nLeonard: Nothing, just catching up. By the way, may I speak to Missy please? \nPenny: Of course.\nMissy: Hi, Leonard, what\u2019s up?\nLeonard: Well, since you\u2019re leaving tomorrow I was wondering if you\u2019d like to go out to dinner with me?\nMissy: That\u2019s so sweet. But no thanks.\nLeonard: Oh. You have other plans, or\u2026?\nMissy: No.\nLeonard: Oh. Alright uh\u2026 enjoy the rest of your evening.\nMissy: Thanks. See you.\nLeonard (returning): Um, here\u2019s something we didn\u2019t anticipate. \n(Time shift. Penny opens door to Howard.)\nPenny: What do you want, Howard?\nHoward: I\u2019m fine, thanks for asking. I\u2019ve come to call on Missy. \nPenny: Missy?\nMissy: Hi Howard.\nHoward: The amazing Howard. Do you like magic?\nMissy: Not really. No.\nHoward: Then you are in for a treat. Behold, an ordinary cane. (Taps against doorpost. While humming he tries to perform a trick, but the cane falls in half with a yellow handkerchief flying out. Howard has to retrieve the pieces.) Da-dah! (Emerges with the handkerchief, on which are written the words \u201cwill you go out with me?\u201d)\nMissy: No.\nHoward: Okay. (Does something with hands, from which another yellow handkerchief emerges. This one reads \u201care you sure?\u201d Missy closes the door.)\n(Time shift. Penny opens the door to Raj.)\nPenny: Missy?\nRaj: Thank you. I apprec\u2026. (looks panicked) apprec\u2026. appreeee\u2026. oh-oh.\nPenny: Oh, honey, is your medication wearing off?\u00a0 (Raj nods.)\nMissy: Oh, hi, cutie pie. I was hoping you\u2019d show up. \n(Raj attempts to speak. All that emerges is a high pitched wail. After a few more attempts he turns and leaves down the stairs, still making the same sound.) \nMissy: We had a dog who made a noise like that. Had to put him down. \nScene: The stairwell. Missy and Sheldon are descending. \nMissy: Any news you want me to pass along to Mom?\nSheldon: Well, she might be interested to know that I have refocused my research from bosonic string theory to heteronic string theory. \nMissy: Yeah, I\u2019ll just tell her you said hey.\nSheldon: Okay, well, it was pleasant seeing you, other than that business with my testicles. (Holds out hand to shake.)\nMissy: Come on, Shelly. (Hugs him. He looks uncomfortable, then hugs back half heartedly.) I want you to know I\u2019m very proud of you.\nSheldon: Really?\nMissy: Yup, I\u2019m always bragging to my friends about my brother the rocket scientist. \nSheldon: You tell people I\u2019m a rocket scientist?\nMissy: Well yeah.\nSheldon: I\u2019m a theoretical physicist.\nMissy: What\u2019s the difference?\nSheldon: What\u2019s the difference?\nMissy: Goodbye Shelly.\nSheldon: My God! Why don\u2019t you just tell them I\u2019m a toll taker at the Golden Gate Bridge? Rocket scientist, how humiliating. \nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "4_9": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The apartment. \nRaj: You know who\u2019s got to be the bravest person in the Marvel Universe? Whoever has to give She-Hulk a bikini wax.\nHoward: You want to talk brave, how about Captain America\u2019s undocumented Mexican gardener?\nLeonard: He\u2019s not braver than whoever uses the bathroom after The Thing?\nSheldon: As usual, you\u2019re all wrong. The bravest person in the Marvel Universe is the doctor who gives Wolverine his prostate exam.\nHoward: How about the guy who gets a prostate exam from Wolverine?\nSheldon: Now you just being silly. Wolverine\u2019s never displayed the slightest interest in helping others prevent prostate cancer. (Answering phone) Hello. Yes, the elevator\u2019s out of order you\u2019ll have to use the stairs. Of course you can. Pizza dates back to the 16th century, while the first elevator was not installed until 1852. That means that for over 300 years, people carried pizzas up stairs. Be part of that proud tradition.\nLeonard: I\u2019ll go get Penny while that guy spits on our food.\nRaj: Do you think they gave Wolverine an Adamantium prostate?\nHoward: That\u2019s a stupid question.\nRaj: We\u2019re having a conversation about probing the heinies of superheroes. There are no stupid questions.\nScene: Penny\u2019s door. \n \nMan: Yes?\nLeonard: Oh, um, is Penny here?\nMan: You\u2019re Leonard, right?\nLeonard: Yeah.\nMan: Damn, it\u2019s good to finally meet you, son.\nLeonard: Okay, I think a bit of context here might help.\nPenny: Oh, hey, Leonard. I see you met my dad.\nLeonard: Oh, good. Context.\nPenny\u2019s Dad: Come on in, buddy. Take a load off.\nPenny: Oh, gee, dad, Leonard can\u2019t stay. He just dropped by to say hello. Thanks for stopping by, sweetie. I\u2019ll see you later. (Kisses him passionately) Bye.\nLeonard: That was odd.\nCredits sequence. \n \nScene: The apartment. \nSheldon: Are you sure you have enough comics? You\u2019re going to be monitoring the telescope for 12 hours, and by my estimate, you\u2019ve only selected seven hours of reading material. That\u2019s even factoring in your difficulty in parsing American comic book idioms like Bamf and Snikt.\nRaj: Is that racist? It feels racist.\nHoward: Don\u2019t be oversensitive. He\u2019s calling you illiterate, not your race.\nRaj: Oh, okay. Good. I don\u2019t need more comics. Howard\u2019s gonna stop by, we\u2019re gonna play intergalactic battleship and Indian Monopoly.\nSheldon: I don\u2019t care for novelty editions of Monopoly. I prefer the classics, regular and Klingon.\nHoward: Actually, Indian Monopoly\u2019s just like regular, except the money\u2019s in Rupees, instead of hotels you build call centers, and when you pick a chance card, you might die of dysentery. Just FYI, that was racist.\nLeonard: You\u2019ll never guess what just happened.\nSheldon: You went out in the hallway, stumbled into an interdimensional portal which brought you 5,000 years into the future, where you took advantage of the advanced technology to build a time machine, and now you\u2019re back to bring us all with you to the year 7010 where we are transported to work at the thinkatorium by telepathically controlled flying dolphins?\nLeonard: No.\nSheldon: Aw.\nLeonard: Penny kissed me.\nSheldon: Well, who would ever guess that?\nRaj: What\u2026 what kind of a kiss?\nLeonard: A big kiss. On the mouth.\nHoward: Is it possible that she was going for your cheek and you moved and she accidentally got lip? That happens with me and my mom all the time.\nLeonard: She introduced me to her father, kissed me and then shut the door in my face.\nHoward:Maybe she was trying to send you a message.\nLeonard: You think?\nHoward: Yeah. This man is not my father. I\u2019m being held hostage. So I\u2019m going to do something insane in the hopes that you\u2019ll call 911.\nLeonard: Penny kissing me is not insane. She used to kiss me all the time.\nSheldon: Einstein defined insanity as doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. By that standard, Penny is cuckoo for cocoa puffs.\nLeonard: I\u2019m just saying, it felt like it may have meant something.\nHoward: Ah, this takes me back. Leonard obsessing about Penny. I mean, don\u2019t get me wrong, I love your new stuff, but once in a while it\u2019s nice to hear the hits.\nRaj: Ooh, ooh! Do our babies will be smart and beautiful. That one always makes me laugh.\nLeonard: Why do I bother talking to you people?\nSheldon: If it\u2019ll make you feel better, we rarely listen.\nPenny (at door): Hey, can I talk to you out here for a sec?\nLeonard: Yeah, sure.\nSheldon: I\u2019m starting to think we\u2019re never going to see that pizza.\nPenny: So you\u2019re probably wondering what that was all about.\nLeonard: What, uh, the kissing and everything? Nah, women do that to me all the time.\nPenny: Yeah, okay. The thing is, I kind of told my father we got back together again.\nLeonard: What? Why?\nPenny: Well, you\u2019re the first guy he\u2019s ever really approved of, you know? You\u2019re a scientist who went to college and you don\u2019t have a neck tattoo or outstanding warrants or, or a baby.\nLeonard: What kind of guys did you used to go out with?\nPenny: Just guys. Anyway, when I told him we split up, he was heartbroken, and he kept bugging me, how\u2019s Leonard? why can\u2019t you get back together with Leonard? I bet Leonard never tipped a cow over on himself. So to get him off my back, I told him we worked things out.\nLeonard: Really? How, how\u2019d we manage that?\nPenny: What?\nLeonard: Well, did you apologize? Did you have to woo me?\nPenny: Get over yourself. I whistled, you came running.\nLeonard: Yeah, no, I don\u2019t think so.\nPenny: Okay, why are you arguing about this?\nLeonard: I\u2019m just saying, if we fake got back together, that\u2019s totally not how it fake happened.\nPenny: Oh, okay, whatever. Will you please just play along until my dad leaves?\nLeonard: Hold on, you actually want me to deceive your father with some sort of sham play acting and kissing? Cause I\u2019m good with that.\nPenny\u2019s Dad: Penny, you out here?\nPenny: Come on, honey, not in front of my dad.\nPenny\u2019s Dad: Relax, I\u2019ve seen you do a lot worse with a lot stupider.\nLeonard: See? He doesn\u2019t mind.\nPenny\u2019s Dad: So, Leonard, I\u2019m taking your gal out for a steak dinner, you want to join us?\nPenny: Oh, dad, that\u2019s nice, but Leonard has to work. Right, Leonard?\nLeonard: Uh, I do, I have to work. But I\u2019m gonna blow that off to spend the evening with my sweetie and her father, \u2019cause, you know, just the kind of boyfriend I am.\nPenny: Oh.\nLeonard: Come here, you.\nScene: Raj\u2019s Lab.\nHoward: C-7.\nRaj: Miss.\nHoward: How could that be a miss? C-6 was a hit, C-8 was a hit. Part of your starship has to be on C-7.\nRaj: Not if it has a hole in the middle.\nHoward: What kind of spaceship has a hole in the middle?\nRaj: A Romulan battle bagel?\nBernadette: Knock-knock.\nHoward: Oh, great, you made it. Come on in. I invited her.\nBernadette: So where\u2019s the telescope?\nHoward: It\u2019s in Hawaii, but Raj controls it from here. He\u2019s hoping to see Epsilon Eridani dim, which would be evidence of a planet orbiting it.\nBernadette: So we just sit and stare at the screen, waiting for something to happen?\nHoward: I did it with you when we rented The Notebook. (Raj whispers) Yes, Gena Rowlands is a treasure. You\u2019d better open up that bottle of wine or I\u2019m gonna end up with swimmer\u2019s ear.\nRaj: Excuse me. I can\u2019t be drinking, I\u2019m about to make an important scientific discovery here.\nHoward: What? Galileo did his best work while drinking wine.\nRaj: How do you know that?\nHoward: Well, he was Italian. It\u2019s a reasonable assumption.\nRaj: Dude, can you even open your mouth without spewing a cultural stereotype?\nHoward: Oh, I, I\u2019m sorry, Galileo drank diet sprite. Look, you\u2019re my best friend, she\u2019s my girlfriend, you should bond. You know, like you and my mom did.\nRaj: Your mom creeps the hell out of me.\nHoward: Yes, but she\u2019s stopped calling you slumdog millionaire.\nRaj: I do appreciate that.\nBernadette: Here we go.\nHoward: Well I\u2019d like to propose a toast. To science and friendship.\nBernadette: Hold on. Wait. No, it\u2019s okay, go ahead.\nHoward: What?\nBernadette: Oh, I was working with Penicillin-resistant gonorrhoea in the lab today and I was just trying to remember if I washed my hands.\nScene: Penny\u2019s dad\u2019s car. \nLeonard: Thanks for the steak, Wyatt.\nPenny\u2019s dad (Wyatt): My pleasure. It\u2019s nice to have dinner with a boyfriend of Penny\u2019s that knows how to use a napkin.\nPenny: So not funny, dad.\nWyatt: Let me tell you about this one genius she was going out with, this, this fella Donnie.\nPenny: Oh, will you please let it go?\nWyatt: Donnie was gonna make millions turning farm waste into biofuel and selling it to the government.\nLeonard: A lot of people are doing that.\nPenny: Oh, see?\nWyatt: Yeah, but all Donnie did was mix pig poop with a little water and pump it into his mom\u2019s Camry.\nPenny: Yeah, that\u2019s great. It\u2019s a funny story. Moving on.\nWyatt: And Donnie was a rocket scientist compared to that boy who wanted to get beer pong into the Olympics. What was his name, sweetheart?\nPenny: Curtis, and I\u2019m pretty sure he was joking.\nWyatt: I don\u2019t know. That petition looked real to me.\nPenny: Yeah, okay, I think this ends the ex-boyfriend portion of our evening.\nWyatt: Well, I\u2019m just glad you finally found yourself a keeper.\nLeonard: Thanks, Wyatt. I\u2019m a keeper.\nScene: Outside Penny\u2019s door.\nWyatt: Leonard, you want to come in for a nightcap?\nPenny: Oh, gee, dad, he\u2019d love to, but Leonard has to work in the morning.\nLeonard: Maybe I could go in a little late.\nPenny: No, no, no, you can\u2019t. Your career is far too important.\nWyatt: Behind every great man is a nagging woman who won\u2019t let him have any fun, am I right, Leonard?\nLeonard: Don\u2019t I know it.\nWyatt: Well, good night, son.\nLeonard: Good night, Wyatt. Oh, good night, honey.\nPenny: Good night.\nLeonard: I love you.\nPenny: Love you, too.\nSheldon: Oh, friggety-frak. Not this again.\nScene: The lab. \nHoward: Three, four, five, pass go, get 2,000 Rupees, Six, seven, whoops. Can\u2019t go any further. There\u2019s a sacred cow in my way.\nRaj: Bernadette, please tell your boyfriend to cool it with the cow jokes.\nBernadette: It won\u2019t help. Once he finds a joke he likes, he sticks with it.\nRaj: Yeah. Like his haircut material.\nBernadette: Oh, right. Did you get your hair cut?\nRaj: No. I got them all cut.\nBernadette: Which is still so funny.\nRaj: And when you go to a Chinese restaurant, he always gets the same fortune in his fortune cookie.\nBernadette: Right. Help, I\u2019m a prisoner in a Chinese fortune cookie factory.\nHoward: Okay, I think that\u2019s enough about me.\nRaj: He\u2019s right. Let\u2019s make fun of his mother. Howard, come rub my feet! My corns are killing me!\nBernadette: Howard, help me out of the tub! I\u2019m stuck again!\nScene: The apartment. \nLeonard: Coming. Hey, lovebug.\nPenny: Shut up. You know what I\u2019ve been doing for the last hour?\nLeonard: Mm, dreamily doodling Mrs. Leonard Hofstadter in a notebook?\nPenny: Listening to my father go on and on about what a great guy you are.\nLeonard: You got to admit, I am, I\u2019m delightful.\nPenny: Why are you making this so difficult?\nLeonard: It\u2019s not difficult for me. I\u2019m having fun.\nPenny: Leonard.\nLeonard: What do you want me to do? You started this. Do you want to go over and tell him we\u2019re broken up?\nPenny: No.\n\u2013\nLeonard: Well, then, what do you want?\nPenny: I don\u2019t know.\nLeonard: Don\u2019t you think that\u2019s something you should have figured out before you stomped over here?\nPenny: Maybe.\nSheldon: Leonard, Penny, excellent. I\u2019d like to say I\u2019m very happy that you\u2019re back together, and if I can figure out a way to do so and sound sincere, I will. In the meantime, I\u2019d like to go over some proposed changes to the roommate agreement specifically to address Penny\u2019s annoying personal habits.\nPenny: Oh, my God. What personal habits?\nLeonard: I have a list. FYI, overuse of the phrase, oh, my god, is number 12.\nPenny: Okay, Sheldon, you don\u2019t have to do this because Leonard and I are not\u2026\nLeonard: Ba-ba-ba-ba. Are you sure you want to include him in this?\nSheldon: Include me in what? Is there a plot afoot? I\u2019ll have no truck with plots.\nPenny: No, you\u2019re right. No, there\u2019s, there\u2019s no plots, no trucks, no feet. So what other annoying habits shall we discuss?\nSheldon: Uh, we don\u2019t discuss anything. Leonard is the signatory to the Roommate Agreement. As such, he bears responsibility for all your infractions and must pay all fines.\nLeonard: Fines?\nSheldon: Yes. If Penny\u2019s going to be spending nights here again, you\u2019ll need to set up an escrow account. Sign here.\nScene: The lab.\nRaj: Hello, Hawaii. This is Dr. Koothrappali in Pasadena. I\u2019d like you to reposition the telescope, please. Scarlett Johansson\u2019s house! I\u2019m kidding, Hawaii. Mahalo. Whoo!\nHoward: It might have been a mistake to open that second bottle of wine.\nBernadette: Well, live and learn. So, Raj, do you think this planet you\u2019re looking for could have an atmosphere that supports life?\nRaj: Maybe. If it did, I\u2019d be famous. I\u2019d be on the cover of magazines. And then, instead of living alone in my tiny apartment, I\u2019d have a big mansion.\nBernadette: That sounds great.\nRaj: It is. If you like wandering around a big, empty house with no one to love you.\nHoward: We\u2019d come visit you.\nRaj: No, you wouldn\u2019t. You\u2019d be intimidated by my wealth and fame. My only friends would be my genetically engineered monkey butler, and the little people I hired to be my living chess set.\nBernadette: He\u2019s taking a turn to the dark side, isn\u2019t he?\nHoward: Hold on. He could come back.\nRaj: Oh, what\u2019s the point of everything?\nHoward: Nope. He\u2019s gone.\nRaj: You know it\u2019s been more than a year since I\u2019ve even kissed a girl?\nHoward: What about that hook-up at Comic-Con you told me about?\nRaj: Oh, grow up. I was lying. I lie all the time. Nobody wants to kiss me.\nBernadette: Oh, you poor, poor thing. Raj, you have to know you\u2019re a wonderful man. There are a lot of girls out there who\u2019ll want to kiss you.\nRaj: Where?\nBernadette: You just have to look.\nHoward: No!\nBernadette: Well, this was fun.\nScene: The apartment. Wyatt and Leonard are playing Wii fishing.\nWyatt: Oh! I think I got a nibble.\nLeonard: Oh, b-be careful. Give him some line. Okay, now reel him in.\nWyatt: Oh, look at that baby. They\u2019re really biting, huh?\nLeonard: Yeah. They do that when you set it on easy.\nWyatt (phone rings): Oh, that\u2019s me. Hello. Oh, hi, sweetie. Yeah, I got up early and didn\u2019t want to wake you, so I went out for coffee and ran into Leonard on the way back. Guess what, we\u2019re fishing. Yeah. Right here on his couch.\nLeonard: Hey, baby. I love you! Mwuh, mwuh, mwuh, mwuh, mwuh.\nWyatt: That\u2019s Leonard says he loves you. What? I see. The whole thing\u2019s bull squirt, huh? Well, that\u2019s very disappointing. Bye.\nLeonard: Oh, hey. There\u2019s been something I\u2019ve been meaning to tell you.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment. \nWyatt: I can\u2019t believe you would lie to me like that.\nLeonard: Just for the record, I did not want to be a part of this.\nWyatt: I\u2019ll get to you in a minute.\nLeonard: No hurry.\nWyatt: That my own daughter thinks I don\u2019t love her enough to support her no matter what choices she makes, well, that hurts me deeply.\nPenny: I\u2019m sorry, daddy\u2026\nWyatt: Let me finish.\nPenny: Oh.\nWyatt: I thought we were past the days when you would try to pull the wool over my eyes. Telling me the baggie in your underwear drawer is potpourri? And the pee stick in your bathroom is to check for diabetes?\nPenny: You know, I\u2019m sorry.\nWyatt: You\u2019re a grown woman, and I respect your right to make your own decisions, but all I ask is you respect me enough to be honest about them.\nPenny: You\u2019re right. Look, from now on, I will tell you the truth.\nWyatt: Thank you. Now, why don\u2019t you go and put some clothes on and we\u2019ll grab a bite to eat before I head for the airport. Now you.\nPenny: Daddy, he had nothing to do\u2026\nWyatt: Keep walking.\nPenny: Okay.\nWyatt: Please, please, please don\u2019t give up on her.\nLeonard: What?\nWyatt: I can\u2019t go back to the skateboard idiots, the white rappers and all those sweaty dumb-asses with their backwards hats.\nLeonard: Gee, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s in the cards, sir.\nWyatt: Then, stack the deck. Cheat. Lie. I don\u2019t care. I want grandkids before I die, and I want them to grow up in a house without wheels.\nLeonard: I\u2019ll give it a shot.\nWyatt: Thank you. Now I\u2019m going to do something here to help you along.\nLeonard: Excuse me?\nWyatt: Just don\u2019t panic. Now, get your sorry, lying ass out of my face and make sure I never see it again!\nLeonard: Oh, the reverse psychology thing. I see. That\u2019s very clever.\nWyatt: Don\u2019t yap. Just get out.\nLeonard: I\u2019ll friend you on Facebook.\nScene: The apartment. \nSheldon: Oh, there you are. Just so you know, I was up all night, but I have finally completed the Penny-specific section of the new roommate agreement.\nLeonard: Yeah, well, not necessary. We broke up again.\nSheldon: Do you even think about other people, Leonard? Do you?\nScene: The cafeteria.\nRaj: Hey.\nLeonard: Oh, how\u2019d it go last night?\nRaj: Oh, you know. Same old, same old. Looked through a telescope, saw some stars. Big whoop.\nLeonard: Really? You waited months for time with that telescope. What happened?\nRaj: Why? You writing a book?\nSheldon: I\u2019m going to propose a hypothesis. Last night, Raj accidentally made contact with an alien civilization and has been ordered by the United States government to keep it a secret.\nRaj: Nothing happened. Can we please just change the subject?\nSheldon: That sounds rehearsed. We are not alone.\nHoward: Hey.\nLeonard: Hey.\nSheldon: Hello.\nHoward: Hey.\nRaj: Hey.\nLeonard: You get to play with Raj\u2019s big telescope last night?\nHoward: Whoa. Where did that come from?\nRaj: He never touched my telescope.\nHoward: Way to go shutting up.\nRaj: I did shut up. Now you shut up.\nHoward: Fine.\nRaj: Thank you. How come you didn\u2019t call me this morning?\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "3_3": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The apartment kitchen. Penny is cooking breakfast while singing and dancing along to \u201cMan I Feel Like A Woman\u201d by Shenia Twain. Sheldon enters.\nPenny: Morning, Sheldon. Come dance with me.\nSheldon: No.\nPenny: Why not?\nSheldon: Penny, while I subscribe to the many worlds theory which posits the existence of an infinite number of Sheldons in an infinite number of universes, I assure you that in none of them am I dancing.\nPenny: Are you fun in any of them?\nSheldon: The math would suggest that in a few I\u2019m a clown made of candy. But I don\u2019t dance.\nPenny: All right, want some French toast?\nSheldon: It\u2019s Oatmeal Day.\nPenny: Tell you what, next French Toast Day, I will make you oatmeal.\nSheldon: Dear Lord, are you still going to be here on French Toast Day?\nLeonard: Morning.\nSheldon: Look, Leonard, Penny made French toast.\nLeonard: Sorry. I haven\u2019t given her your schedule yet.\nSheldon: It\u2019s an iCal download, she can put it right in her phone. And I thought we agreed that you\u2019d have your conjugal visits in her apartment.\nLeonard: We did, but there were extenuating circumstances.\nSheldon: I see. Did her abysmal housekeeping skills finally trump her perkiness?\nLeonard: No, her bed kind of\u2026 broke.\nSheldon: That doesn\u2019t seem likely. Her bed\u2019s of sturdy construction. Even the addition\nof a second normal size human being wouldn\u2019t cause a structural failure, much less a homunculus such as yourself.\nPenny: A homunculus?\nLeonard: Perfectly formed miniature human being.\nPenny: Oh, you\u2019re my little homunculus.\nLeonard: Don\u2019t do that.\nPenny: Sorry. Okay, who wants syrup and who wants cinnamon sugar?\nSheldon: I want oatmeal.\nPenny: Yes, well, I want a boyfriend whose roommate isn\u2019t a giant pain in the ass.\nSheldon: I\u2019m sure that will happen soon enough. But in the meantime, I still want oatmeal.\nPenny: You know what, I give up. He\u2019s impossible.\nSheldon: I can\u2019t be impossible. I exist. I believe what you meant to say is, \u201cI give up, he\u2019s improbable.\u201d\nLeonard: Sheldon, you really need to find a better way of dealing with Penny.\nSheldon: What am I supposed to do, eat French toast on a Monday? Now, that would be impossible.\nLeonard: I\u2019m just saying, you can catch more flies with honey than with vinegar.\nSheldon: You can catch even more flies with manure. What\u2019s your point?\nLeonard: It\u2019s a\u2026 (gives up)\nSheldon: Boy, that does smell good. Too bad it\u2019s Monday.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The apartment.\n \nPenny: Okay, so Kim the night manager went on maternity leave, and her husband\u2019s name is Sandy, right? So get this, her replacement is a woman named Sandy whose husband\u2019s name is Kim.\nLeonard: Wow!\nPenny: I know. What are the odds?\nSheldon: Easily calculable, we begin by identifying the set of married couples with unisex names. We then eliminate those unqualified for restaurant work, the aged, the imprisoned and the limbless, for example. Next we look at\u2026\nLeonard: Sheldon! it\u2019s an amazing coincidence, can we leave it at that?\nSheldon: I\u2019m sorry. Ooh, Penny, it\u2019s as if the Cheesecake Factory is run by witches.\nPenny: Ooh, Sheldon, it\u2019s as if you don\u2019t think I\u2019ll punch you.\nLeonard: Come on, you guys, let it go.\nPenny: Fine, whatever. Are you finished?\nSheldon: Well, thank you. How thoughtful. Would you like a chocolate\nPenny: Um, yeah, sure, thanks.\nLeonard: What was that?\nSheldon: You said be nice to Penny. I believe offering chocolate to someone falls within the definition of nice.\nLeonard: It does. But in my experience, you don\u2019t.\nSheldon: There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy.\nLeonard: Yeah, yeah, now that\u2019s you, obnoxious and insufferable.\nHoward (arriving, in goth gear): What\u2019s going on, day dwellers?\nPenny: Oh, man, did the Kiss Army repeal don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell?\nHoward: No. Raj and I are going a goth club in Hollywood to hang with the night people. Anybody want to come along?\nPenny: Oh, wow, you\u2019re actually going out like that?\nHoward: No, no. I\u2019m going out like this. (Whips off jacket to reveal tattoos up both arms)\nLeonard: Howard, what did you do?\nHoward: They\u2019re called tattoo sleeves. Look. I bought them online, Raj got a set, too. Fantastic, right? Put them on, have hot sex with some freaky girl with her business pierced, take them off, and I can still be buried in a Jewish cemetery.\nSheldon: You know, I\u2019ve always wanted to go to a goth nighclub.\nHoward: Really?\nSheldon: Bazinga! None of you ever see my practical jokes coming, do you?\nHoward: Okay, how about you two? Look, I\u2019ve got some extra tat sleeves.\nLeonard: Why are you carrying extras?\nHoward: Well, In case I snag one on someone\u2019s nipple ring.\nPenny: Uh, yeah, I think we\u2019ll pass.\nHoward: Oh, is the missus speaking for the couple now?\nLeonard: In this case, you bet she is.\nHoward (after Raj whispers): Yes, she\u2019s pushy and yes, he\u2019s whipped, but that\u2019s not the expression. Come on, I want to stop at Walgreens and pick up some more eyeliner.\nLeonard: They\u2019re gonna get beaten up at that club.\nPenny: They\u2019re gonna get beaten up at Walgreens. Oh, sorry, Sheldon, I almost sat in your spot.\nSheldon: Did you? I didn\u2019t notice. Have a chocolate.\nPenny: Thank you.\nScene: The goth club.\n \nRaj: I think we\u2019re fitting in quite nicely.\nHoward: It\u2019d help if you weren\u2019t drinking light beer.\nRaj: Oh, what\u2019s so gothic about vodka and cranberry juice?\nHoward: Hello, it looks like blood. Did you even read the Wiki How link I sent you on being goth?\nRaj: No, I\u2019m behind on my wiki-reading I\u2019m kind of on a John Grisham kick right now.\nHoward: What?\nRaj: Well, I finished reading The Pelican Brief and loved it so much, I dived right into The Client. He was a lawyer himself so his novels are accurate as well as entertaining.\nHoward: Just remember we are lost boys, children of the night.\nRaj: Great. Lost boys, children of the night. Got it. Can you pass the Chex mix, please. Thank you. We are lost boys.\nGirl: Good for you.\nHoward: I\u2019m actually much morelost than he is.\nGirl: Nice ink.\nHoward: Thanks. Can we buy you ladies a drink?\nGirl: Two light beers.\nRaj: Light beers? Well, Wiki-how about that?\nSecond girl: What\u2019s your names?\nHoward: I\u2019m Howard.\nRaj: Raj.\nGirl: I\u2019m Bethany.\nHoward: Nice to meet you, Bethany.\nRaj: Yes, very nice.\nBethany: Nice to meet you too.\nSecond girl: I\u2019m Sarah. Not that anyone cares.\nRaj: Do either of you ladies enjoy the novels of John Grisham?\nScene: The apartment. \nPenny: What\u2019s this cartoon called again?\nLeonard: Oshikuru: Demon Samurai.\nSheldon: And it\u2019s not a cartoon, it\u2019s anime.\nPenny: Anime. You know, I knew a girl in high school named Anna May. Anna May Fletcher. She was born with one nostril. Then she had this bad nose job and basically wound up with three.\nSheldon: You\u2019re here a lot now.\nPenny: Oh, am I talking too much? I\u2019m sorry. Zip.\nSheldon: Thank you. Chocolate?\nPenny: Yes please. (Her phone rings) Oh. Hey, Kim. Yeah, I\u2026 (sees Sheldon looking disapprovingly) You know what, hold on, let me take this in the hall. (Sheldon silently offers her another chocolate. She takes it.) You\u2019ll never guess who they got to replace you at work\u2026\nLeonard: Okay, I know what you\u2019re doing.\nSheldon: Really?\nLeonard: Yes, you\u2019re using chocolates as positive reinforcement for what you consider correct behaviour.\nSheldon: Very good. Chocolate?\nLeonard: No, I don\u2019t want any chocolate! Sheldon, you can\u2019t train my girlfriend like a lab rat.\nSheldon: Actually, it turns out I can.\nLeonard: Well, you shouldn\u2019t.\nSheldon: There\u2019s just no pleasing you, is there, Leonard? You weren\u2019t happy with my previous approach to dealing with her, so I decided to employ operant conditioning techniques, building on the work of Thorndike and B.F. Skinner. By this time next week, I believe I can have her jumping out of a pool, balancing a beach ball on her nose.\nLeonard: No, this has to stop now.\nSheldon: I\u2019m not suggesting we really make her jump out of a pool. I thought the \u201cbazinga\u201d was implied. I\u2019m just tweaking her personality, sanding off the rough edges if you will.\nLeonard: No, you\u2019re not sanding Penny.\nSheldon: Are you saying that I\u2019m forbidden from applying a harmless, scientifically valid protocol that will make our lives better?\nLeonard: Yes, you\u2019re forbidden.\nSheldon (Squirting him with a water spray): Bad Leonard.\nScene: The goth club.\n \nBethany: So what do you guys do?\nHoward: Oh, you know, goth stuff. Goth magazines, goth music.\nRaj: Goth food.\nSarah: What\u2019s goth food?\nRaj: Uh\u2026 blackened salmon?\nBethany: No, I meant what do you do for jobs?\nRaj: Oh, we\u2019re scientists.\nHoward: Yeah, you know, the dark sciences.\nBethany: What are the dark sciences\nRaj: Well, I am an astrophysicist and a lot of that takes place at night. When there are vampires and miscellaneous undead out and about.\nHoward: Oy vay.\nRaj: That sounds really cool.\nHoward: Does it? Okay, if you like space stuff, I design components for the international space station. Which is in space. Where, as I\u2019m sure you know, no one can hear you scream.\nRaj: So what do you gals do?\nBethany: I work at the Gap.\nHoward: Really? How about that? I\u2019ve been to the Gap.\nRaj: Yeah, I\u2019ve been there as well. I like your tee-shirts with the little pocket.\nSarah: I work there too. Not that anyone cares. You know, this place is boring.\nBethany: Yeah. Why don\u2019t we go somewhere else and have some fun?\nHoward: Okay.\nRaj: Sure, we like fun.\nHoward: We are fun people.\nRaj: Dark and fun.\nBethany: Come on, I know a place you\u2019ll really dig.\nHoward: Did you bring the black condoms?\nRaj: In my fanny pack.\nHoward: Let\u2019s go.\nScene: A tattoo parlour. Bethany is getting a tattoo.\n \nRaj: Are you happy now?\nHoward: Not particularly.\nScene: The apartment.\n \nPenny (voice outside door): Oh\u2019 my God, she didn\u2019t!\nLeonard: What could she possibly be talking about for so long?\nSheldon: Obviously, waitressing at the Cheesecake Factory is a complex socioeconomic activity, that requires a great deal of analysis and planning. Bazinga! You know, using positive reinforcement techniques, I could train that behaviour out of her in a week.\nLeonard: No.\nSheldon: If you let me use negative reinforcement, I can get it done before we go to bed.\nLeonard: You\u2019re not squirting her in the face with water.\nSheldon: No, of course not. We\u2019re talking very mild electric shocks. No tissue damage whatsoever.\nLeonard: Forget it.\nSheldon: Oh, come on, you can\u2019t tell me that you\u2019re not intrigued about the possibility of building a better girlfriend.\nLeonard: I\u2019m not. And Penny\u2019s qualities, both good and bad, are what make her who she is.\nSheldon: You mean, like that high-pitched, irritating laugh?\nLeonard: Yes.\nSheldon You wouldn\u2019t prefer a throaty chuckle?\nLeonard: You\u2019re not changing how Penny laughs.\nSheldon: No, that would be incongruous, I was going to lower the whole voice to a more pleasing register.\nPenny (entering): Uh, sorry guys, that girl is (high pitched) freaky!\nSheldon: Come again?\nPenny (normal voice): Freaky.\nSheldon (lower voice): Freaky?\nPenny (lower voice): Yeah, freaky.\nSheldon: Have a chocolate.\nPenny: Thank you.\nScene: The tattoo parlour. Howard is laying down, preparing to have a tattoo on his lower back.\nRaj: Are you seriously going to deface your body just for the possibility you could have cheap sex with a strange girl you met in a bar?\nHoward: Uh, yeah!\nRaj: What is your mother going to say?\nHoward: She\u2019s not going to see it. She takes my temperature orally now.\nBethany: What are you going to get, Howard?\nHoward: Well, I can\u2019t really decide between a screaming devil, this mean little skull or Kermit the Frog.\nBethany: Kermit the Frog?\nHoward: You know (Kermit voice) Hi ho, I\u2019m on Howard\u2019s butt!\nBethany: Get the mean little skull, and I\u2019ll see if I can make him smile.\nHoward: Yeah, I\u2019d like the mean little skull, please.\nSarah: What are you going to get, Raj?\nRaj: With my luck, hepatitis\nTattooist: Okay, here we go.\nHoward: Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!\nTattooist: That\u2019s just rubbing alcohol.\nHoward: I know, but it was cold. Ow, ow, ow!\nTattooist: I\u2019m putting on the stencil.\nHoward: What comes after the stencil?\nTattooist: This.\nHoward: Aaaaaargh! Okay, that\u2019s it, no needle, no pain, no tattoo.\nBethany: What\u2019s the big deal, you\u2019ve done this before.\nHoward: No, I haven\u2019t, look. (Rips off tattoo sleeves) I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m a fraud, he\u2019s a fraud.\nRaj: We\u2019re both frauds.\nHoward: Yeah, I think I covered that.\nRaj: But I was summing up.\nHoward: We\u2019re not goth, we\u2019re just guys.\nRaj: Very, very smart guys.\nBethany: So you were totally scamming us?\nHoward: Yes. And I wouldn\u2019t blame you if you walked out of here and never wanted to see us again. Unless of course our bold honesty has suddenly made us attractive.\nBethany: I\u2019m leaving.\nSarah: I\u2019m leaving too. Not that anyone cares.\nRaj: When we tell this story, let\u2019s end it differently.\nHoward: What are you thinking? Maybe a big musical number?\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Well, I\u2019m going to make some warm milk and then turn in. I trust if you two are planning in engaging in amorous activites, you\u2019ll keep the decibel level to a minimum.\nPenny: Of course.\nSheldon: Thank you. (Throws a chocolate. Penny catches it in her mouth)\n \nPenny: Mmm, these are so good\nLeonard: Unbelievable.\nPenny: What?\nLeonard: I was just thinking, we should probably turn in too.\nPenny: well, my new bed got delivered, if you come over and put it together, you can stay at my place.\nLeonard: Really, that\u2019s a lot of work, and it\u2019s kind of late.\nPenny: Yeah, but if we stay there, we won\u2019t have to be quiet.\nLeonard: Let\u2019s go.\nSheldon: Interesting. Sex works even better than chocolate to modify behaviour. I wonder if anyone else has stumbled on to that.\nScene: Raj\u2019s car.\n \nHoward: Okay, wait, how about this? We say there were four goth girls, the two girls in the club had two friends.\nRaj: I like it, I like it. Did they smell good despite their gothlike nature?\nHoward: What\u2019s that got to do with the story?\nRaj: Engaging my olfactory sense helps make it real for me.\nHoward: Fine, they smelled good.\nRaj: Oh, they did. Like jasmine and honeysuckle.\nHoward: Whatever.\nRaj: And then they held hands and did a sexy, demonic hokey-pokey for us.\nHoward: No, no. Look, let me say my story all the way through, and then you can say yours, and then we\u2019ll pick.\nRaj: I\u2019m sorry. Go on.\nHoward: Okay. We got tattoos, and then the four girls took us to their place.\nRaj: But we don\u2019t have tattoos. What if someone asks to see our tattoos?\nHoward: We say they\u2019re in a very intimate area.\nRaj: Oh, we are bad boys, aren\u2019t we?\nHoward: Right, right, so we go back to their place, and then the six of us end up in a hot tub.\nRaj: But we just got tattoos. Wouldn\u2019t we be concerned about bacterial infection?\nHoward: True. Okay, forget the hot tub. The point is, we each have a m\u00e9nage with sexy goth girls.\nRaj: Wow. What a great night.\nHoward: Yeah. Hey, want to try a country bar tomorrow night.\nRaj: Yeah, maybe we\u2019ll get lucky with some sexy cowgirls.\nHoward: Could happen.\nRaj: I wonder how they smell.\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "5_8": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The apartment.\nPenny: So, Bernadette, how goes the hunt for bridesmaid dresses?\nBernadette: Well, if you don\u2019t mind looking like an orange traffic cone, great.\nAmy: Girlfriends, I have the answer to our dress problems.\nBernadette: Really?\nAmy: Twelve years ago, my cousin Irene and her entire family died in a horrific carbon monoxide accident the night before her wedding.\nBernadette: That\u2019s horrible.\nAmy: Yes and no. All those bridesmaids dresses remain unused and available to us for free. So it seems that cloud of odourless deadly gas had a silver lining after all. Check it out, still in the bags. The gowns, not the bridesmaids.\nBernadette: I don\u2019t know. Dead people\u2019s dresses?\nPenny: Yeah, and cap sleeves? U-u-uh.\nAmy: Uh, I was hoping you wouldn\u2019t notice. Irene was always a slave to a good bargain when it came to clothes, and sadly as it turned out, space heaters.\nSheldon: Ladies, please. These four walls once housed an intellectual salon where the mind received nourishment as well as the stomach. But through no one\u2019s fault, Penny, the quality of dinner conversation in this apartment has declined. And again, I\u2019m looking at no one in particular, Penny.\nLeonard: Fine. What would you like to talk about, Sheldon?\nHoward: What would you like to talk about, Sheldon? Why do you hate us?\nSheldon: I\u2019ve prepared a number of topics that should appeal to both the advanced and novice conversationalists.\nPenny: Okay, that time you looked at me.\nAmy: Who didn\u2019t? Your skin is like alabaster. Do you even have pores?\nSheldon: Topic one. Faster-than-light particles at CERN, paradigm-shifting discovery or another Swiss export as full of holes as their cheese? And converse.\nPenny: All right, who wants to go to my apartment and look at bridal magazines?\nBernadette: Oh, me.\nPenny: Through no one\u2019s fault, Sheldon, we\u2019re leaving.\nAmy: Wait for moi.\nSheldon: You\u2019re leaving?\nAmy: Sheldon, sometimes you forget, I\u2019m a lady. And with that comes an oestrogen fuelled need to page through thick glossy magazines that make me hate my body.\nSheldon: Ah. New topic. Women, delightfully mysterious or bat-crap crazy?\nRaj: Totally. What\u2019s wrong with cap sleeves? If you have the right figure for it, they\u2019re adorable.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The cafeteria.\nLeonard: Hey, Amy, what brings you to our neck of the woods?\nAmy: Your neurology department loaned me a culture of prions for my research on bovine spongiform encephalopathy.\nSheldon: She popped by to borrow a cup of mad cow disease.\nAmy: It\u2019s hard to make degenerative brain maladies hilarious, and yet somehow you do it.\nHoward: That\u2019s fun to have in a lunchroom.\nAmy: The real fun starts when you get to pick the rat you\u2019re going to feed it to, and maybe you choose the beady-eyed little mother who\u2019s been biting you all week.\nHoward: Please, we\u2019re eating. Can we get that off the table and change the subject?\nSheldon: Can we? Stand back while I turn this conversation into a conver-sensation.\nLeonard: This time, it\u2019s your fault.\nSheldon: I have 100 alphabetized topics from artichoke, come on, people, it\u2019s just a giant thistle, to zzz, the onamona-poetry of sleep.\nLeonard: Amy, how long would it take for that mad cow disease to kill me?\nAmy: I don\u2019t know, four or five years.\nLeonard: No, it\u2019s not gonna do it.\nHoward: Oy. Bernadette keeps texting me pictures of Penny in bridesmaid dresses.\nAmy: They\u2019re out shopping right now?\nHoward: Yeah.\nAmy: Just the two of them?\nHoward: I guess.\nAmy: That\u2019s cool, that\u2019s cool.\nHoward: Why are they asking me about this stuff? What guy knows what a sweetheart neckline is? (Raj raises his hand)\nScene: The apartment. Leonard is horseracing on a Kinnect game.\nLeonard: Leonard\u2019s coming down the home stretch! Come on, horsey, you can do this! Damn. Come on, thigh muscles, you can do this! Yes! First place. I would have been a great jockey if I weren\u2019t too tall. And scared of horses. Sheldon, you\u2019re up.\nSheldon: What?\nLeonard: Come on, it\u2019s your turn. We said we\u2019d get more fresh air.\nSheldon: Sorry. I\u2019m a little distracted. I can\u2019t seem to get in touch with Amy. I tried e-mail, video chat, tweeting her, posting on her Facebook wall, texting her, nothing.\nLeonard: Did you try calling her on the telephone?\nSheldon: The telephone. You know, Leonard, in your own simple way, you may be the wisest of us all. Voice mail. Curiouser and curiouser.\nLeonard: If you\u2019re worried, we can go over there and see if she\u2019s all right.\nSheldon: Okay. You know, I heard in the news a bobcat has been spotted in her neighbourhood.\nLeonard: I don\u2019t think Amy was eaten by a bobcat.\nSheldon: Who thinks Amy was eaten by a bobcat?\nLeonard: You do?\nSheldon: Leonard, I was just mentioning an interesting local news item. Now, thanks to you, I\u2019m worried Amy\u2019s been eaten by a bobcat.\nLeonard: Forget about the bobcat.\nSheldon: How can I? You won\u2019t stop talking about it.\nScene: Amy\u2019s apartment. Amy is playing the harp.\nAmy (singing): Everybody hurts, sometimes everybody cries. Everybody hurts, sometimes.\nSheldon (outside): She sounds weepy. I don\u2019t like weepy. Let\u2019s go.\nLeonard: Uh, she\u2019s your friend. Step up.\nLeonard: (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. Bye.\nSheldon: Where are you going?\nLeonard: I\u2019m single, I don\u2019t need this crap.\nAmy: Sheldon, what are you doing here?\nSheldon: You didn\u2019t respond to any of my electronic communications.\nAmy: I wanted to be alone.\nSheldon: Would you like to talk about it? And keep in mind that no is a perfectly viable answer.\nAmy: Sheldon, my world is crumbling around me.\nSheldon: Point of order. As you\u2019re in distress, it would be customary for me to offer you a hot beverage. But I\u2019m a guest in your home, so it would be customary for you to offer me a beverage. How do you want to proceed vis-a-vis beverages?\nAmy: It doesn\u2019t matter. Nothing matters.\nSheldon: If you\u2019d like to take your mind off what\u2019s troubling you, uh, word on the street is a bobcat has been spotted.\nAmy: Penny and Bernadette went shopping for bridesmaids dresses without me.\nSheldon: And that made you feel sad?\nAmy: Yes.\nSheldon: I knew it. Just keep going, I guess I\u2019m good at this.\nAmy: It\u2019s just, I thought they liked hanging out with me, but I guess I was fooling myself.\nSheldon: When they were over here, did you fail to offer them a beverage? \u2018Cause I can see how that could stick in someone\u2019s craw.\nAmy: Sheldon, I\u2019m going to ask you something, and I\u2019d like you to keep an open mind.\nSheldon: Always.\nAmy: At this moment, I find myself craving human intimacy and physical contact.\nSheldon: Oh, boy. You know ours is a relationship of the mind.\nAmy: Proposal. One wild night of torrid lovemaking that soothes my soul and inflames my loins.\nSheldon: Counterproposal. I will gently stroke your head and repeat, aw, who\u2019s a good Amy.\nAmy: How about this? French kissing, seven minutes in heaven culminating in second base.\nSheldon: Neck massage, then you get me that beverage.\nAmy: We cuddle. Final offer.\nSheldon: Very well. Oh, boy. (They cuddle, awkwardly.)\nAmy: I\u2019m just saying, second base is right there.\nScene: The cafeteria.\nRaj: Mm, I\u2019m thinking about adopting some quirky affectation, like a pipe or a monocle or a handlebar moustache.\nLeonard: For all those girls out there looking for the Indian Monopoly man?\nRaj: This is not a safe place. You can\u2019t share anything here.\nSheldon: The two of you need to get your women in line!\nHoward: What?\nSheldon: Last night I was strong-armed into an evening of harp music and spooning with an emotional Amy Farrah Fowler. This on a night that I had originally designated for solving the space-time geometry in higher-spin gravity and building my Lego Death Star. And why? Your gal pals, Penny and Bernadette, went out shopping for some wedding nonsense without Amy, an action they took with no thought or regard as to how it would affect me, the future of string theory or my Lego fun time.\nHoward: What do you want us to do about it?\nSheldon: You clearly weren\u2019t listening to my topic sentence, get your women in line! You make them apologize to Amy and set things right. I am a man of science, not someone\u2019s snuggle bunny!\nLeonard: Why do I have to talk to Penny? She\u2019s not my girlfriend.\nSheldon: You invited her to lunch four years ago. Everything about her is on you, you make it so!\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: Moo-shu is Penny.\nPenny: Thank you. Where\u2019s Sheldon?\nLeonard: Oh, he was up late last night, so I gave him an early dinner and put him to bed.\nBernadette: That\u2019s so sweet.\nLeonard: Yeah, but now he\u2019s gonna be up at dawn and want to play.\nHoward: So, listen, guys, the reason he was up late is because he was taking care of Amy. She\u2019s kind of upset.\nPenny: Why?\nLeonard: Her feelings got hurt because you guys went dress shopping without her.\nBernadette: I told you that would happen.\nPenny: Okay, look, this is her first time being a bridesmaid and she\u2019s just getting a little crazy with it.\nBernadette: She keeps on telling us stories about bridesmaid traditions in other cultures, and they\u2019re all about getting naked and washing each other.\nPenny: Yeah, and she keeps trying to figure out if our cycles have synced up so we can call ourselves the Three Menstra-teers\nBernadette: We thought it would be easier to look at dresses one time without her. I feel terrible.\nPenny: I know. Me, too. We\u2019ll talk to her. Hey, wait, how did she find out?\nHoward: Raj did it. And he says he would do it again. Okay, I\u2019m sorry. You sent me the picture, I wasn\u2019t thinking.\nBernadette: Oh, Howie.\nHoward: Well, hey, I\u2019m usually pretty good at not blabbing. You tell me tons of stuff about these guys, and I never repeat it.\nPenny: What do you tell him?\nBernadette: Oh, you know, just pillow talk. You guys have nothing to worry about.\nLeonard: Hold on, did you talk about us when we were dating?\nPenny: No. All your little secrets are fine.\nBernadette: Yes, absolutely fine.\nHoward (after Raj whispers to him): I\u2019ll tell you later.\nScene: Amy\u2019s lab. Amy is dissecting a brain.\nAmy: Come on, tumour. Come on, tumour, Mama needs an aggressive little glioblastoma. Yay, brain tumour! Probably not the same reaction you had when you got the news.\nPenny: Hi.\nBernadette: Hello.\nAmy: What are you doing here?\nPenny: Well, look, we just wanted to apologize for not bringing you with us the other day.\nAmy: That\u2019s not necessary, it\u2019s like Sesame Street says, one of these things is not like the other, one of these things should die alone.\nPenny: Look, come on, Amy, look, let us make it up to you. We\u2019ll have a girl\u2019s night, we\u2019ll do whatever you want.\nBernadette: We can go down to the Korean baths and do that thing you were talking about where we wash each other.\nPenny: With-with loofah mitts, no hands.\nAmy: It\u2019s okay. I\u2019m glad this happened. I can stop pretending that some beautiful girl and her cute-in-\nthe-right-light friend want to hang out with me.\nBernadette: Amy, we\u2019re really sorry.\nPenny: Yeah, we feel awful.\nAmy: Don\u2019t. I\u2019ll be okay. You\u2019re not the first girls I thought were friends with me who ended up shunning me. It\u2019s like elementary school, junior high, high school, undergrad, grad school, and that semester abroad in Norway all over again.\nPenny: Oh, come on, Amy.\nAmy: You don\u2019t get it. Look at this brain.\nPenny: I don\u2019t really want to.\nAmy: This is us. Bernadette, you are the analytical, scientific left hemisphere. Penny, you\u2019re the creative, spontaneous right hemisphere. And where\u2019s Amy? She\u2019s right here, the sad little tumour no one wants to go dress shopping with.\nBernadette: Amy, you\u2019re not a tumour. Penny, tell her she\u2019s not a tumour. (Penny is vomiting in the dustbin). \nScene: The apartment, Sheldon is building his Lego Death Star. Phone rings.\nSheldon: Did you know that when Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone, he proposed answering it with ahoy? Ahoy. I like it. Amy? Is that you? Have you been drinking? I\u2019m sorry, I bet my sweet what? Well, all right. We\u2019re on our way.\nLeonard: What\u2019s going on?\nSheldon: It would seem Amy is drunk in a liquor store parking lot.\nLeonard: Really? Amy?\nSheldon: Leonard, be glad you can\u2019t keep a woman. They are a handful.\nScene: A liquor store parking lot.\nAmy: Oh, look. It\u2019s Sheldon and little Leonard. Hi, little Leonard.\nLeonard: Hi, Amy.\nAmy: Hey, Cuddles.\nLeonard: Cuddles?\nSheldon: Yes, Cuddles. We cuddled. Grow up, Leonard.\nLeonard: Amy, what are you doing here?\nAmy: Well, I came here to get a bottle of wine like Penny taught me to do when you\u2019re sad.\nLeonard: Yeah, but why didn\u2019t you go back to your apartment?\nAmy: Didn\u2019t you go to high school, Leonard? Parking lots are where all the cool kids hang out. Not that the rat bastards ever invited me.\nLeonard: Maybe we should get you home.\nAmy: Oh, hang on, hang on, hang on. Sheldon, what would it take for you to go into that liquor store, buy a bottle of hooch, take me across the street to that motel, and have your way with me?\nLeonard: Yeah, Sheldon, what would it take?\nSheldon: I\u2019m begging both of you, please, let\u2019s go.\nLeonard: Okay. Come on. Upsy-daisy.\nAmy: Whee! Ooh, finally someone found second base.\nScene: Amy\u2019s lab. She is dissecting a brain.\nAmy: I know how you feel. I got a knife slicing through my frontal lobe, too.\nPenny: Hi.\nAmy: What do you want? Do you want me to give the friendship bracelet back?\nPenny: I never gave you a friendship bracelet.\nAmy: When we first met, I made one and pretended you gave it to me. You can have it back if you want.\nPenny: No, you made that for you, I want you to have it.\nBernadette: We know you\u2019re upset, and you have every right to be, but if it\u2019s okay with you, we\u2019d like a second chance to make things right.\nPenny: We are really sorry, and we were trying to think of some way to show you how much we care about you.\nBernadette: Which is why it would mean so much if you would agree to be the maid of honour at my wedding.\nAmy: What? Wait, is this some kind of practical joke? Like in Norway, when my friends trapped me in a sauna with a horny otter?\nBernadette: No. I, I want you to be the maid of honour.\nAmy: Oh, my gosh. No one\u2019s every asked me to be the maid of honour before. Well, that\u2019s not true. Once, but then they all died.\nBernadette: So is that a yes?\nAmy: Yes. Yes. Oh, my gosh, I, I have so much to do. There\u2019s the bridal shower and the bachelorette party. What should we do for the bachelorette party? Oh, I know, we\u2019ll go to a Native American sweat lodge, we\u2019ll take peyote, roll around in the mud, and paint fertility symbols on Bernadette\u2019s naked body. So that\u2019s happening.\nPenny: Yeah, sure, sure. Vegas is fun, too.\nAmy: I feel like crying. Of course, I could just be hormonal. Oh, wait. Maybe our menses are finally syncing up. Bernadette? No? Penny?\nPenny: Sorry.\nAmy: Really?\nPenny: Okay, yeah.\nAmy: Yay!\nScene: A bridal store.\nAmy: Maid of honour Amy Farrah Fowler\u2019s amazing behind-the-scenes wedding video, take one.\nBernadette: We\u2019re just trying on dresses, do we really need to record this?\nAmy: I\u2019m sorry, are you the maid of honour?\nBernadette: I am the bride.\nAmy: So no. And action.\nPenny (in a red bridesmaid dress): What do you think?\nBernadette: I love it!\nAmy: What are you, a nun? Come on, bestie, let\u2019s see some skin.\nCut to Amy in a lilac dress.\nBernadette: Oh, Amy! Looking sexy!\nAmy: You think they don\u2019t have mirrors in there? I know how I look.\nCut to Bernadette in a wedding dress.\nPenny: Oh! Bernadette, you look beautiful!\nAmy: You do.\nBernadette: Thank you.\nAmy: Not Penny beautiful, but beautiful.\nCut to changing room door.\nAmy: Come on, bestie, you\u2019re up.\nPenny (off): Give me a minute.\nAmy: What is taking you so long? (Opens door. Penny is in her underwear)\nPenny: Oh, Amy! Get the hell out of here!\nAmy: \u2013 Sorry, sorry. (Swings camera away. Then back again)\nPenny: Oh, God.

I have a sister with the same basic DNA mix who hostesses at Fuddruckers.\nLeonard: Sheldon, this was your idea. A little extra money to get fractional T1 bandwidth in the apartment.\nSheldon: I know, and I do yearn for faster downloads, but there\u2019s some poor woman is going to pin her hopes on my sperm, what if she winds up with a toddler who doesn\u2019t know if he should use an integral or a differential to solve the area under a curve.\nLeonard: I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll still love him.\nSheldon: I wouldn\u2019t.\nLeonard: Well, what do you want to do?\nSheldon: I want to leave.\nLeonard: Okay.\nSheldon: What\u2019s the protocol for leaving?\nLeonard: I don\u2019t know, I\u2019ve never reneged on a proffer of sperm before.\nSheldon: Let\u2019s try just walking out.\nLeonard: Okay.\n\nReceptionist: Bye.\nSheldon: Bye-bye\nLeonard: See you.\nScene: The stairs of the apartment building.\nSheldon: Are you still mad about the sperm bank?\nLeonard: No.\nSheldon: You want to hear an interesting thing about stairs?\nLeonard: Not really.\nSheldon: If the height of a single step is off by as little as two millimetres, most people will trip.\nLeonard: I don\u2019t care.

We need to widen our circle.\nSheldon: I have a very wide circle. I have 212 friends on myspace. \nLeonard: Yes, and you\u2019ve never met one of them.\nSheldon: That\u2019s the beauty of it.\nLeonard: I\u2019m going to invite her over.

Again.\nPenny: Hi.\nSheldon: Hi.\nLeonard: Hi.\nPenny: Hi. \nLeonard: Anyway, um. We brought home Indian food. And, um. I know that moving can be stressful, and I find that when I\u2019m undergoing stress, that good food and company can have a comforting effect. Also, curry is a natural laxative, and I don\u2019t have to tell you that, uh, a clean colon is just one less thing to worry about.\nSheldon: Leonard, I\u2019m not expert here but I believe in the context of a luncheon invitation, you might want to skip the reference to bowel movements.\nPenny: Oh, you\u2019re inviting me over to eat?\nLeonard: Uh, yes.\nPenny: Oh, that\u2019s so nice, I\u2019d love to.\nLeonard: Great.\nPenny: So, what do you guys do for fun around here?\nSheldon: Well, today we tried masturbating for money.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: Sheldon and Leonard\u2019s apartment.\nLeonard: Okay, well, make yourself at home.\nPenny: Okay, thankyou.\nLeonard: You\u2019re very welcome.\nPenny: This looks like some serious stuff, Leonard, did you do this?\nSheldon: Actually that\u2019s my work.\nPenny: Wow.\nSheldon: Yeah, well, it\u2019s just some quantum mechanics, with a little string theory doodling around the edges. That part there, that\u2019s just a joke, it\u2019s a spoof of the Bourne-Oppenheimer approximation.\nPenny: So you\u2019re like, one of those, beautiful mind genius guys.\nSheldon: Yeah. \nPenny: This is really impressive.\nLeonard: I have a board. If you like boards, this is my board.\nPenny: Holy smokes.\nSheldon: If by holy smokes you mean a derivative restatement of the kind of stuff you can find scribbled on the wall of any men\u2019s room at MIT, sure.\nLeonard: What?\nSheldon: Oh, come on. Who hasn\u2019t seen this differential below \u201chere I sit broken hearted?\u201d\nLeonard: At least I didn\u2019t have to invent twenty-six dimensions just to make the math come out.\nSheldon: I didn\u2019t invent them, they\u2019re there.\nLeonard: In what universe?\nSheldon: In all of them, that is the point.\nPenny: Uh, do you guys mind if I start?\nSheldon: Um, Penny, that\u2019s where I sit.\nPenny: So, sit next to me. \nSheldon: No, I sit there.\nPenny: What\u2019s the difference?\nSheldon: What\u2019s the difference?\nLeonard: Here we go.\nSheldon: In the winter that seat is close enough to the radiator to remain warm, and yet not so close as to cause perspiration. In the summer it\u2019s directly in the path of a cross breeze created by open windows there, and there. It faces the television at an angle that is neither direct, thus discouraging conversation, nor so far wide to create a parallax distortion, I could go on, but I think I\u2019ve made my point. \nPenny: Do you want me to move?\nSheldon: Well.\nLeonard: Just sit somewhere else.\nSheldon: Fine. (Wanders in circles, looking lost.)\nLeonard: Sheldon, sit!\n\nSheldon: Aaah!\nLeonard: Well this is nice. We don\u2019t have a lot of company over.\nSheldon: That\u2019s not true. Koothrapali and Wolowitz come over all the time. \nLeonard: Yes I now, but\u2026\nSheldon: Tuesday night we played Klingon boggle until one in the morning.\nLeonard: Yes, I remember.\nSheldon: I resent you saying we don\u2019t have company.\nLeonard: I\u2019m sorry.\nSheldon: That is an antisocial implication.\nLeonard: I said I\u2019m sorry.\nPenny: So, Klingon boggle?\nLeonard: Yeah, it\u2019s like regular boggle but, in Klingon. That\u2019s probably enough about us, tell us about you.\nPenny: Um, me, okay, I\u2019m Sagittarius, which probably tells you way more than you need to know.\nSheldon: Yes, it tells us that you participate in the mass cultural delusion that the Sun\u2019s apparent position relative to arbitrarily defined constellations and the time of your birth somehow effects your personality.\nPenny: Participate in the what?\nLeonard: I think what Sheldon\u2019s trying to say, is that Sagittarius wouldn\u2019t have been our first guess.\nPenny: Oh, yeah, a lot of people think I\u2019m a water sign. Okay, let\u2019s see, what else, oh, I\u2019m a vegetarian, oh, except for fish, and the occasional steak, I love steak. \nSheldon: That\u2019s interesting. Leonard can\u2019t process corn.\nLeonard: Wu-uh, do you have some sort of a job?\nPenny: Oh, yeah, I\u2019m a waitress at the Cheesecake Factory.\nLeonard: Oh, okay. I love cheesecake.\nSheldon: You\u2019re lactose intolerant. \nLeonard: I don\u2019t eat it, I just think it\u2019s a good idea.\nPenny: Oh, anyways, I\u2019m also writing a screenplay. It\u2019s about this sensitive girl who comes to L.A. from Lincoln Nebraska to be an actress, and winds up a waitress at the Cheesecake Factory.\nLeonard: So it\u2019s based on your life?\nPenny: No, I\u2019m from Omaha. \nLeonard: Well, if that was a movie I would go see it.\nPenny: I know, right? Okay, let\u2019s see, what else? Um, that\u2019s about it. That\u2019s the story of Penny.\nLeonard: Well it sounds wonderful.\nPenny: It was. Until I fell in love with a jerk. \nSheldon (mouths): What\u2019s happening.\nLeonard (mouths back): I don\u2019t know.\nPenny: Oh God, you know, four years I lived with him, four years, that\u2019s like as long as High School. \nSheldon: It took you four years to get through High School?\nLeonard: Don\u2019t.\nPenny: I just, I can\u2019t believe I trusted him.\n\nLeonard: Should I say something? I feel like I should say something.\nSheldon: You? No, you\u2019ll only make it worse.\nPenny: You want to know the most pathetic part? Even though I hate his lying, cheating guts, I still love him. Is that crazy?\nSheldon: Yes. \nLeonard: No, it\u2019s not crazy it\u2019s, uh, uh, it\u2019s a paradox. And paradoxes are part of nature, think about light. Now if you look at Huygens, light is a wave, as confirmed by the double slit experiments, but then, along comes Albert Einstein and discovers that light behaves like particles too. Well, I didn\u2019t make it worse.\nPenny: Oh, I\u2019m so sorry, I\u2019m such a mess, and on top of everything else I\u2019m all gross from moving and my stupid shower doesn\u2019t even work.\nLeonard: Our shower works.\nPenny: Really? Would it be totally weird if I used it?\nSheldon: Yes. \nLeonard: No.\nSheldon: No?\nLeonard: No.\nSheldon: No.\nLeonard: It\u2019s right down the hall.\nPenny: Thanks. You guys are really sweet.\n\nSheldon: Well this is an interesting development. \nLeonard: How so?\nSheldon: It has been some time since we\u2019ve had a woman take her clothes off in our apartment.\nLeonard: That\u2019s not true, remember at Thanksgiving my grandmother with Alzheimer\u2019s had that episode.\nSheldon: Point taken. It has been some time since we\u2019ve had a woman take her clothes off after which we didn\u2019t want to rip our eyes out. \nLeonard: The worst part was watching her carve that turkey.\nSheldon: So, what exactly are you trying to accomplish here?\nLeonard: Excuse me?\nSheldon: That woman in there\u2019s not going to have sex with you.\nLeonard: Well I\u2019m not trying to have sex with her.\nSheldon: Oh, good. Then you won\u2019t be disappointed.\nLeonard: What makes you think she wouldn\u2019t have sex with me, I\u2019m a male and she\u2019s a female?\nSheldon: Yes, but not of the same species.\nLeonard: I\u2019m not going to engage in hypotheticals here, I\u2019m just trying to be a good neighbour.\nSheldon: Oh, of course.\nLeonard: That\u2019s not to say that if a carnal relationship were to develop that I wouldn\u2019t participate. However briefly.\nSheldon: Do you think this possibility will be helped or hindered when she discovers your Luke Skywalker no-more-tears shampoo?\nLeonard: It\u2019s Darth Vader shampoo. (There is a knock on the door.) Luke Skywalker\u2019s the conditioner.\n\nHoward: Wait till you see this.\nRaj: It\u2019s fantastic. Unbelievable.\nLeonard: See what?\nHoward: It\u2019s a Stephen Hawking lecture from MIT in 1974.\nLeonard: This is not a good time.\nHoward: It\u2019s before he became a creepy computer voice:.\nLeonard: That\u2019s great, you guys have to go.\nRaj: Why?\nLeonard: It\u2019s just not a good time.\nSheldon: Leonard has a lady over.\nHoward: Yeah, right, your grandmother back in town?\nLeonard: No. And she\u2019s not a lady, she\u2019s just a new neighbour.\nHoward: Hang on, there really is a lady here?\nLeonard: Uh-huh.\nHoward: And you want us out because you\u2019re anticipating coitus?\nLeonard: I\u2019m not anticipating coitus.\nHoward: So she\u2019s available for coitus?\n Leonard: Can we please stop saying coitus?\nSheldon: Technically that would be coitus interruptus.\nPenny: Hey, is there a trick to getting it to switch from tub to shower. Oh. Hi, sorry. Hello!\nHoward: Enchante Madamoiselle. Howard Wolowitz, Cal-Tech department of Applied Physics. You may be familiar with some of my work, it\u2019s currently orbiting Jupiter\u2019s largest moon taking high-resolution digital photographs.\nPenny: Penny. I work at the Cheesecake Factory.\nLeonard: Come on, I\u2019ll show you the trick with the shower.\nHoward: Bon douche.\nPenny: I\u2019m sorry?\nHoward: It\u2019s French for good shower. It\u2019s a sentiment I can express in six languages.\nLeonard: Save it for your blog, Howard.\nHoward: See-ka-tong-guay-jow.\nScene: In the bathroom.\nLeonard: Uh, there it goes, it sticks, I\u2019m sorry.\nPenny: Okay. Thanks. \nLeonard: You\u2019re welcome, oh, you\u2019re going to step right, okay, I\u2019ll\u2026.\nPenny: Hey, Leonard?\nLeonard: The hair products are Sheldon\u2019s.\nPenny: Um, okay. Can I ask you a favour.\nLeonard: A favour? Sure, you can ask me a favour, I would do you a favour for you.\nPenny: It\u2019s okay if you say no.\nLeonard: Oh, I\u2019ll probably say yes.\nPenny: It\u2019s just not the kind of thing you ask a guy you\u2019ve just met.\nLeonard: Wow.\nScene: Leonard and Sheldon, Inside Leonard\u2019s car\nSheldon: I really think we should examine the chain of causality here.\nLeonard: Must we?\nSheldon: Event A. A beautiful woman stands naked in our shower. Event B. We drive half way across town to retrieve a television set from the aforementioned woman\u2019s ex-boyfriend. Query, on what plane of existence is there even a semi-rational link between these events?\nLeonard: She asked me to do her a favour, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Ah, yes, well that may be the proximal cause of our journey, but we both know it only exists in contradistinction to the higher level distal cause.\nLeonard: Which is?\nSheldon: You think with your penis.\nLeonard: That\u2019s a biological impossibility and you didn\u2019t have to come.\nSheldon: Oh, right, yes, I could have stayed behind and watched Wolowitz try to hit on Penny in Russian, Arabic and Farsi. Why can\u2019t she get her own TV.\nLeonard: Come on, you know how it is with break-ups.\nSheldon: No I don\u2019t. And neither do you.\nLeonard: Wuh, I, I broke up with Joyce Kim.\nSheldon: You did not break up with Joyce Kim, she defected to North Korea.\nLeonard: To mend her broken heart. This situation is much less complicated. There\u2019s some kind of dispute between Penny and her ex-boyfriend as to who gets custody of the TV. She just wanted to avoid having a scene with him.\nSheldon: So we get to have a scene with him?\nLeonard: No, Sheldon, there\u2019s not going to be a scene. There\u2019s two of us and one of him.\nSheldon: Leonard, the two of us can\u2019t even carry a TV. \nScene: Back at the apartment.\nPenny (to Raj): So, you guys work with Leonard and Sheldon at the University?\n(Raj looks at her, looks back at his food, takes a mouthful).\nPenny: Uh, I\u2019m sorry, do you speak English?\nHoward: Oh, he speaks English, he just can\u2019t speak to women.\nPenny: Really, why?\nHoward: He\u2019s kind of a nerd. Juice box?\nScene: Outside Penny\u2019s old apartment building.\nLeonard (pushes buzzer): I\u2019ll do the talking.\nVoice from buzzer: Yeah.\nLeonard: Hi, I\u2019m Leonard, this is Sheldon.\nSheldon: Hello.\nLeonard: What did I just\u2026. Uh, we\u2019re here to pick up Penny\u2019s TV.\nVoice: Get lost.\nSheldon: Okay, thanks for your time.\nLeonard: We\u2019re not going to give up just like that.\nSheldon: Leonard, the TV is in the building, we\u2019ve been denied access to the building, ergo we are done.\nLeonard: Excuse me, if I were to give up at the first little hitch I never would have been able to identify the fingerprints of string theory in the aftermath of the big bang.\nSheldon: My apologies. What\u2019s your plan.\n(Leonard starts rattling the doors violently.)\nSheldon: It\u2019s just a privilege to watch your mind at work.\nLeonard: Come on, we have a combined IQ of 360, we should be able to figure out how to get into a stupid building.\n(Two girl scouts arrive carrying bags of cookies. One runs her hand down the intercom, pushing all the buttons. The door is buzzed open.)\nSheldon: What do you think their combined IQ is?\nLeonard: Just grab the door.\nScene: Outside Penny\u2019s ex-boyfriend\u2019s apartment.\nLeonard: This is it. (Knocks.) I\u2019ll do the talking.\nSheldon: Good thinking, I\u2019ll just be the muscle.\nEnormous man: Yeah?\nLeonard: I\u2019m Leonard, this is Sheldon.\nSheldon: From the intercom.\nMan: How the hell did you get in the building?\nLeonard: Oh. We\u2019re scientists.\nSheldon: Tell him about our IQ.\nScene: Outside the apartment building. Leonard and Sheldon exit. They are not wearing trousers.\nSheldon: Leonard.\nLeonard: What?\nSheldon: My mom bought me those pants.\nLeonard: I\u2019m sorry.\nSheldon: You\u2019re going to have to call her.\nScene: On the stairs of Sheldon and Leonard\u2019s building.\nLeonard: Sheldon, I\u2019m so sorry I dragged you through this.\nSheldon: It\u2019s okay. It wasn\u2019t my first pantsing, and it won\u2019t be my last.\nLeonard: And you were right about my motives, I was hoping to establish a relationship with Penny that might have some day led to sex.\nSheldon: Well you got me out of my pants.\nLeonard: Anyway, I\u2019ve learned my lesson. She\u2019s out of my league, I\u2019m done with her, I\u2019ve got my work, one day I\u2019ll win the Nobel Prize and then I\u2019ll die alone.\nSheldon: Don\u2019t think like that, you\u2019re not going to die alone.\nLeonard: Thank you Sheldon, you\u2019re a good friend.\nSheldon: And you\u2019re certainly not going to win a Nobel Prize.\nScene: Inside Sheldon and Leonard\u2019s apartment.\nHoward: This is one of my favourite places to kick back after a quest, they have a great house ale.\nPenny: Wow, cool tiger.\nHoward: Yeah, I\u2019ve had him since level ten. His name is Buttons. Anyway, if you had your own game character we could hang out, maybe go on a quest.\nPenny: Uh, sounds interesting.\nHoward: So you\u2019ll think about it?\nPenny: Oh, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be able to stop thinking about it.\nRaj: Smooth.\nLeonard: We\u2019re home.\nPenny: Oh, my God, what happened?\nLeonard: Well, your ex-boyfriend sends his regards and I think the rest is fairly self-explanatory.\nPenny: I\u2019m so sorry, I really thought if you guys went instead of me he wouldn\u2019t be such an ass.\nLeonard: No, it was a valid hypothesis.\nSheldon: That was a valid hypothesis? What is happening to you?\nPenny: Really, thank you so much for going and trying you\u2019re, uh, you\u2019re so terrific. Why don\u2019t you put some clothes on, I\u2019ll get my purse and dinner is on me, okay?\nLeonard: Really? Great.\nSheldon: Thank you. You\u2019re not done with her, are you?\nLeonard: Our babies will be smart and beautiful.\nSheldon: Not to mention imaginary.\nScene: All five in Leonard\u2019s car.\nLeonard: Is Thai food okay with you Penny?\nPenny: Sure.\nSheldon: We can\u2019t have Thai food, we had Indian for lunch.\nPenny: So?\nSheldon: They\u2019re both curry based cuisines.\nPenny: So?\nSheldon: They would be gastronomically redundant. I can see we\u2019re going to have to spell out everything for this girl.\nPenny: Any ideas Raj? (He just looks at her with a worried expression.)\nHoward: Turn left on Lake Street and head up to Colorado. I know a wonderful little sushi bar that has karaoke.\nPenny: That sounds like fun.\nHoward (sings): Baby, baby don\u2019t get hooked on me. Uh, baby, baby don\u2019t get hooked on me.\nSheldon: I don\u2019t know what your odds are in the world as a whole, but as far as the population of this car goes, you\u2019re a veritable Mack Daddy.\nWritten by Chuck Lorre and Bill Prady\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "4_7": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The University Cafeteria.\nLeonard: No, seriously, I think I\u2019ve finally figured out my problem with women.\nSheldon: The capybara is the largest member of the rodent family.\nLeonard: What does that have to do with me and women?\nSheldon: Nothing. It was a desperate attempt to introduce an alternate topic of conversation.\nLeonard: My problem is, I don\u2019t project confidence. So I decided that the next time I meet a woman I think is attractive, rather than holding back and being cautious, I\u2019m going to assume the mantle of self-assurance.\nRaj: Oh, yeah? What\u2019s that look like?\nLeonard: Hi. I\u2019m Leonard. And you are beautiful. You pop, sparkle and buzz electric. I\u2019m going to pick you up at eight, show you a night you will never forget.\nRaj: Where are we going?\nHoward: Good news. I made it onto the team for the new Defence Department laser-equipped surveillance satellite.\nSheldon: Excuse me. If we\u2019re changing topics, I believe I have first dibs with capybara, a rodent the size of a baby hippo.\nLeonard: Congratulations Howard.\nHoward: Thanks. Listen, I have to get a security clearance, so you guys might be hearing from the FBI.\nRaj: Whoa, whoa, whoa! I don\u2019t want to speak to the FBI.\nLeonard: Why not?\nRaj: I\u2019m brown and I talk funny.\nHoward: They\u2019re just doing a background check on me.\nRaj: It doesn\u2019t matter. They\u2019ll find a reason to give me a one-way ticket back to Gandhi-ville. By the way, when I say that, it\u2019s not offensive.\nLeonard: Don\u2019t be ridiculous, Raj. You\u2019re here legally.\nRaj: Nobody cares. Do you know how long it\u2019s been since I got through airport security without being given a colonoscopy?\nSheldon: You know, I try very hard to make our lunch hours educational and informative, but your insistence on talking about your own lives stymies me at every turn.\nLeonard: Fine, Sheldon, tell us about your giant rodents.\nSheldon: No, you squandered your time with me, and the moment has now passed. Feast on your disappointment, much as the capybara feasts on its own waste.\nCredits sequence.\n \nScene: Raj\u2019s apartment. Raj is reading New Moon.\nRaj: Oh, Bella, don\u2019t you see? Edward\u2019s only pushing you away because he loves you. (Knock on door) Coming.\nWoman at Door: Dr. Koothrappali? (Raj nods) I\u2019m Special Agent Page, FBI. May I come in? (Nods again) I\u2019d like to talk to you about Howard Wolowitz. (Indicates sofa) Oh, thank you. All right. Well, how long have you known Mr. Wolowitz?\nRaj (Holds up finger to indicate he will be right back. Runs to kitchen. Tries to drink wine but bottle is empty. Looks in fridge and finds rum cake. Comes back stuffing a piece in his mouth): Rum cake?\nPage: No, thanks. Now, about Mr. Wolowitz.\nRaj: Seven years.\nPage: I see.\nRaj: I\u2019m in this country legally, you know.\nPage: I\u2019m sure you are. Now, to your knowledge, has Mr. Wolowitz ever committed a crime?\nRaj: Of course not. I\u2019m here on an H-1B visa, which means I can\u2019t be associated in any way with crime or criminal activity. And I\u2019m not.\nPage: Good. To your knowledge, does Mr. Wolowitz have any foreign contacts?\nRaj: No, just me. Oh, there it is. Here comes a cavity search.\nPage: Excuse me?\nRaj: Please don\u2019t send me back to India, it\u2019s so crowded. It\u2019s like the whole country is one endless Comic-Con, except everybody\u2019s wearing the same costume, Indian Guy.\nPage: Dr. Koothrappali, I\u2019m not\u2026\nRaj: I love this country! The-the baseball, the freedom, the rampant morbid obesity! From California to the New York Island, I\u2019m a real Yankee Doodle boy!\nPage: Dr. Koothrappali, please.\nRaj: My country \u2019tis of thee, duh duh duh liberty, It\u2019s really great.\nScene: Leonard\u2019s lab. \nLeonard: So, when Howard said the FBI would be contacting me, I was expecting Mulder. Glad to see I got Scully.\nPage: Who?\nLeonard: Mulder and Scully. X-Files. The truth is out there. Never mind. Uh, so, what would you like to know?\nPage: You work with Mr. Wolowitz here at the university, correct?\nLeonard: Yes. Of course, we\u2019re in different departments. He\u2019s an engineer and I\u2019m an experimental physicist. You know, one of those guys who examines the building blocks of creation and says, Hello, maker of the universe, I see what you did there. Good one.\nPage: Right. Now, how would you characterize your relationship with Mr. Wolowitz?\nLeonard: Good. It\u2019s a good relationship. Of course, most of my relationships are good. Probably because I exude confidence. People are drawn to that, you know? Confidence, not exuding.\nPage: Do you know of any groups Mr. Wolowitz is a member of?\nLeonard: You are beautiful, you know that? You pop, sparkle and buzz electric. I\u2019m going to pick you up at eight, show you a night you will never forget.\nPage: Sounds great.\nLeonard: Really?\nPage: Yeah. Can my six-foot-two Navy SEAL husband come with us?\nLeonard: Is that, oh, my, I didn\u2019t see the ring with my glasses off, so, look at that, I\u2019m starting to exude.\nScene: The apartment. There is a knock on the door.\nLeonard: Want to get that?\nSheldon: Not particularly.\nLeonard: Could you get that?\nSheldon: I suppose I could if I were asked.\nLeonard: Would you please get that?\nSheldon: Of course. Why do you have to make things so complicated?\nPage: Dr. Cooper?\nSheldon: Yes.\nPage: I\u2019m Special Agent Page, FBI.\nSheldon: You say you\u2019re Special Agent Page, FBI.\nPage: Here\u2019s my I.D.\nSheldon: And here is my Justice League membership card. But that doesn\u2019t prove I know Batman.\nPage: I just want to ask you a few questions about Howard Wolowitz.\nSheldon: Oh. All right. I doubt anyone would risk the stiff penalties for impersonating a federal officer just to ask questions about a minor league engineer with an unresolved Oedipal complex.\nPage: Thank you.\nSheldon: For the record, I truly support the FBI in the mission which is expressed through their motto?\nPage: Fidelity, bravery, integrity?\nSheldon: Correct. Now to business. 18 years ago, I sent the FBI Crime Lab samples from a bag of excrement that had been lit on fire on my front porch for fingerprinting and DNA analysis. Why haven\u2019t I heard back yet?\nPage: Well, the FBI Crime Lab does have a lot on its plate.\nSheldon: That\u2019s of little comfort to a nation attempting to scrape burning feces off its shoes.\nPage: Would you mind if we talked about Mr. Wolowitz now?\nSheldon: A little, but go on.\nPage: Thank you. Would you characterize him as responsible?\nSheldon: I\u2019m going to answer that with a visual aid. This is my nine-disc complete Lord of the Rings trilogy blu-ray set.\u00a0 Mr. Wolowitz borrowed it, damaged plastic retention hub number three, and then returned it to me, hoping I wouldn\u2019t notice. Would you characterize that as responsible?\nPage: That\u2019s really not the sort of thing we\u2019re interested in.\nSheldon: You heard me say blu-ray, right?\nPage: I did.\nSheldon: Very well. Would you be interested in knowing that Mr. Wolowitz once snuck onto my World of Warcraft account and changed the name of a certain level-80 warlock from Sheldor to Smeldor?\nPage: I\u2019m afraid not. Is there anything else?\nSheldon: Is there anything else? Where would you like to start? He refuses to pay fines when he\u2019s overdue with books I lend him. He crashed the Mars Rover while attempting to impress a woman. He recommended that I go see the third Matrix movie because it was, and I quote, just as good as the first one. If that\u2019s not irresponsible, I don\u2019t know what is.\nPage: The Mars Rover?\nSheldon: Did I say Mars Rover?\nPage: You did.\nSheldon: That was actually a poorly chosen example, as it had nothing to do with me.\nPage: Yes, well, let\u2019s talk about it anyway.\nSheldon: I don\u2019t want to. Not that my disinclination to discuss the topic should be interpreted as evidence of Howard Wolowitz\u2019s culpability in the destruction of government property worth millions of dollars.\nPage: Thank you, Dr. Cooper. I think I have all I need.\nSheldon: Oh, good. I was afraid you were going to fixate on that Mars Rover incident.\nScene: The cafeteria.\nHoward: Hey, buddies. Guess who didn\u2019t get security clearance to work on the giant space laser?\nLeonard: What happened?\nHoward: Apparently, the background interviews didn\u2019t go well. You guys wouldn\u2019t know anything about that, would you?\nRaj: Well, actually, I may have gotten a little tipsy when I talked to her.\nLeonard: And I may have hit on her a little bit.\nRaj: I may have thrown up rum cake on her shoes.\nHoward: I see. Well, it\u2019s good to know, when I need you guys, I can always count on you to step up and ruin everything.\nLeonard: I feel awful.\nRaj: Ah, me, too.\nLeonard: To tell you the truth, I thought if anyone was going to screw things up for Howard, it\u2019d be Sheldon.\nSheldon: Well, your expectations have been subverted. Aha.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: What are you doing up?\nSheldon: Sleep eludes me, Leonard.\nLeonard: Really? Maybe sleep has met you before.\nSheldon: Mockery? That\u2019s all you have to offer?\nLeonard: I\u2019m sorry. Why can\u2019t you sleep?\nSheldon: Who knows? I haven\u2019t watched any scary movies recently. I\u2019m no longer obsessing over why the predicted mass of the quantum vacuum has little effect on the expansion of the universe. And it\u2019s been weeks since I took that accidental sip of Red Bull.\nLeonard: Did something happen today that\u2019s bothering you?\nSheldon: Well, I did mention the Mars Rover incident to that FBI agent and probably cost Howard his security clearance.\nLeonard: What?\nSheldon: But why should that keep me up?\nLeonard: Because you feel guilty?\nSheldon: Interesting. So you\u2019re saying my insomnia is caused by a guilty conscience.\nLeonard: Actually, you don\u2019t have insomnia. You\u2019re sleeping now.\nSheldon: Excuse me?\nLeonard: You\u2019re having a guilt-ridden dream.\nSheldon: Do you have any evidence to support that hypothesis?\nLeonard: How about that Gorn sitting on the couch?\nSheldon: That seems fairly conclusive. (In his bed) No, Gorn, no. That\u2019s where I sit.\nScene: Agent Page\u2019s Office.\nSheldon: Thank you for agreeing to see me, Agent Page.\nPage: Thank you for filing a complaint with my superior, Dr. Cooper. I understand you want to recant your statement about Howard Wolowitz.\nSheldon: Yes.\nPage: Was your statement untrue?\nSheldon: No.\nPage: Then I\u2019m afraid you can\u2019t withdraw it.\nSheldon: I\u2019m sorry. I don\u2019t recall you saying no backsies.\nPage: Is there anything else?\nSheldon: Yes. I\u2019d like to offer a laudatory statement about Howard\u2019s many excellent qualities that I believe will tip the scales back in his favour. Howard Joel Wolowitz. H is for honesty, of which he has much. O\u2019s for outstanding, which he is such. W\u2019s for witty, he\u2019s quick with a joke. A\u2019s for artistic, his ability\u2026\nPage: I\u2019m sorry, Dr. Cooper, this matter is already closed.\nSheldon: But I still have rd Joel Wolowitz left to go.\nPage: It\u2019s closed.\nSheldon: I don\u2019t understand why you people are picking on my friend, Howard, when there are much more serious security threats to pursue. For instance, when I first met Leonard, he was on the verge of giving away rocket secrets to a North Korean spy, and not one agent ever investigated that.\nPage: This is Leonard Hofstadter?\nSheldon: No, it\u2019s a different Leonard. He\u2019s Chinese, red hair, six fingers. Good-bye.\nScene: A corridor at the university.\nSheldon: Raj. Have you seen Howard?\nRaj: I think he\u2019s eating lunch. Uh, Sheldon, I want you to meet Neil deGrasse Tyson from the Hayden Planetarium in New York.\nSheldon: I\u2019m quite familiar with Dr. Tyson. He\u2019s responsible for the demotion of Pluto from planetary status. I liked Pluto. Ergo I do not like you.\nDr Tyson: But I actually didn\u2019t demote Pluto. That was a vote of the International Astronomical Union.\nSheldon: If ifs and buts were candy and nuts, we\u2019d all have a merry Christmas. Think about that, Dr. Tyson.\nDr Tyson: Is that the guy you were telling me about?\nRaj: Oh, yeah.\nScene: The cafeteria.\nSheldon: Howard. The person at fault for you not getting a security clearance is me.\nHoward: You?\nSheldon: Yes, but before you get upset, I want you to know I went to the FBI and retracted my statement.\nHoward: And they were okay with that?\nSheldon: No. If anything, I made it worse. In any case, I have been riddled with guilt, which is causing Gorn-infested REM sleep. So, I\u2019m here now to say I\u2019m sorry.\nHoward: Are you kidding me? You\u2019ve set my career back at least two years, and you think you can make it right with I\u2019m sorry?\nSheldon: Yes. I followed the social protocol. I attempted to right the wrong, and when I failed to do so I delivered a heartfelt apology. Now you say apology accepted, and I will offer you a one-time-only high five.\nHoward: Your apology is not accepted.\nSheldon: You\u2019re tricking me. It really is, isn\u2019t it?\nHoward: Leave me alone, Sheldon.\nDr Tyson: Dr. Cooper, I just wanted you to know I\u2019m sorry for the role I played in the Pluto matter.\nSheldon: Oh, shut up.\nScene: The bar of the Cheesecake Factory.\nPenny: Sheldon?\nSheldon: Hello.\nPenny: What are you doing here?\nSheldon: I have troubles, Penny. I\u2019ve come to pour them out to the sympathetic ear of the local barkeep.\nPenny: You know, they have a really nice bar over at the Olive Garden.\nSheldon: I don\u2019t like the Olive Garden. They treat me like family.\nPenny: Okay, Sheldon. What can I get you?\nSheldon: Alcohol.\nPenny: Could you be a little more specific?\nSheldon: Ethyl alcohol. 40 millilitres.\nPenny: I\u2019m sorry, honey, I don\u2019t know millilitres.\nSheldon: Ah. Blame President James \u201cJimmy\u201d Carter. He started America on a path to the metric system but then just gave up. He wonders why he was a one-term president.\nPenny (pouring out a shot of tequila): Would you say that\u2019s about 40 milliliters?\nSheldon: More or less.\nPenny: Great. (Drinks the tequila) Now, where were we?\nSheldon: I believe you were about to ask me to choose a cocktail. Fortunately, thanks to computer-savvy alcoholics, there\u2019s an app for that. Let\u2019s see. Harvey Wallbanger. Eh. Sex on the Beach. I hardly think so. Rob Roy, Silk Slipper, Mad Hatter. Ooh! I\u2019ll have a Rosewater Ricky.\nPenny: A what?\nSheldon: You\u2019ll need pitted, brandied cherries, gin, rosewater, angostura bitters and overproofed rum. Now, first, dust the cherries with sugar, then spray them with a mixture of rum and bitters. Then ignite the rum, caramel\u2026\nPenny (pouring out a shot of tequila): Here you go, one Rosewater Ricky.\nSheldon: That\u2019s not how it looks in the picture.\nPenny: Oh, yeah, you know, every bartender makes it differently. Why don\u2019t you give it a try.\nSheldon: All right. To the metric system. (Knocks back drink. Spits it all back into glass.) I can\u2019t taste the cherries.\nPenny: All right. Sheldon, what\u2019s on your mind?\nSheldon: I wronged Howard, and he won\u2019t accept my apology.\nPenny: Oh, right, that. Yes, Leonard told me. Sorry, honey.\nSheldon: Penny, you face failure on a daily basis. How do you cope?\nPenny: I drink.\nSheldon: To drinking. (Knocks back drink and spits it out again.) Nope. Oh, if only there were some way to force Howard to accept my apology so I could escape this miasma of guilt.\nPenny: You know, sometimes stuff just happens, and there\u2019s nothing you can do about it. For example, Lisa Peterson hasn\u2019t talked to me since the 11th grade, because no matter how much you apologize, you can\u2019t go back and un-dry-hump someone\u2019s boyfriend.\nSheldon: I see. You\u2019re saying I\u2019m facing Starfleet Academy\u2019s unwinnable command scenario, the Kobayashi Maru.\nPenny: Exactly. Sometimes you can\u2019t win.\nSheldon: Captain Kirk won.\nPenny: Kirk cheated.\nSheldon: Impressive that you know that. It\u2019s hard to believe I\u2019m actually having this conversation with you.\nPenny: Right there with you.\nSheldon: Kirk beat the Kobayashi Maru by reprogramming the simulator. That\u2019s it.\nPenny: What?\nSheldon: I\u2019ll reprogram Howard.\nPenny: What? Sheldon, you can\u2019t reprogram people.\nSheldon: No, you can\u2019t reprogram people. To James Tiberius Kirk. (Drinks. Leaves. Comes back and spits it out again.)\nScene: The cafeteria.\nSheldon: Hello, all.\nRaj: Hello.\nLeonard: Hey.\nSheldon: Howard, you\u2019re feeling better about me today, aren\u2019t you?\nHoward: Not really.\nSheldon: Yes, you are. I\u2019m using neurolinguistic programming to modify your thought patterns.\nHoward: Oh. Go away, Sheldon.\nSheldon: There\u2019s a nine ninety five e-book down the drain.\nRaj: What\u2019s in the bag?\nSheldon: It\u2019s for Howard.\nHoward: Oh. Sheldon, you can\u2019t fix this with gifts.\nSheldon: Nevertheless, I\u2019ve hurt you, and whether you forgive me or not, I want you to have this.\nHoward: You\u2019re giving me a couch cushion?\nSheldon: No. The cushion is merely symbolic. I\u2019m giving you my spot on the couch.\nHoward: But you love that spot.\nSheldon: No. I love my mother. My feelings for my spot are much greater. It is the singular location in space around which revolves my entire universe. And now it\u2019s yours.\nRaj: Oh, my God, dude. Now you have to forgive him.\nHoward: All right. Apology accepted.\nSheldon: High five. Not too hard. Thank you.\nRaj: I haven\u2019t cried like this since Toy Story 3.\nScene: The apartment. \nHoward: I got to tell you, Sheldon, I understand why you chose this spot. I mean, the temperature is good, but there\u2019s no draft. I can see the television, but I can still talk to\u2026\nSheldon: I changed my mind. Get out of my spot.\nPenny: How long?\nLeonard: 94 seconds.\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "7_14": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The apartment.\nHoward: T-minus 60 seconds.\nRaj: Oh, it all comes down to this.\nLeonard: Oh, I\u2019ve got butterflies.\nSheldon: Don\u2019t get soft on me, Hofstadter. I will slap those glasses right off your face.\nPenny: What\u2019s going on?\nLeonard: Hey. We\u2019re about to buy tickets for Comic-Con.\nPenny: Oh.\nHoward: T Minus 45 seconds.\nLeonard: They sell out incredibly fast, but as long as one of us gets in, we can buy passes\u2026\nSheldon: Good Lord, this is not the time for flirting, keep it in your pants.\nPenny: This is a whole lot of weird before coffee.\nHoward: T-minus 30 seconds.\nRaj: Oh, I have to go to the bathroom so bad.\nSheldon: Every year. I told you, wear a diaper.\nRaj: And I told you I get diaper rash.\nHoward: 15 seconds.\nLeonard: Well, this is it, this is it. This is it.\nHoward: Five, four, three, two, one. \nSheldon: It\u2019s live. Go, go, go, go, go.\nRaj: Anyone in?\nSheldon: No.\nLeonard: Not yet. \nHoward: Nope.\nSheldon: Do not stop refreshing your screens.\nAll (repeatedly): Refresh. Refresh. Refresh\u2026.\nPenny: Yeah, this is not gonna be enough coffee.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The same, shortly after.\nAll (repeatedly): Refresh\u2026 Refresh\u2026 Refresh\u2026\nHoward: It\u2019s been ten minutes. We\u2019re running out of time.\nPenny: To be cool? Yeah.\nLeonard: I did it, I did it, I\u2019m in the queue.\nSheldon: Yay! And they say firefighters are the real heroes.\nRaj: Uh, what number in line are you?\nLeonard: Uh, fifteen\u2026\nHoward: Great.\nLeonard: \u2026thousand two hundred and eleven.\nHoward: Damn.\nRaj: Oh, they only have Thursday and Sunday passes left.\nHoward: Really?\nLeonard: Oh, Thursday\u2019s gone. Just Sunday left.\nSheldon: Oh, Sunday\u2019s the worst. Everybody\u2019s leaving, most of the good panels are over, and the only T-shirts they have left are small and XXXXL.\nLeonard: Sunday\u2019s gone.\nSheldon: Not Sunday, I love Sunday.\nRaj: So that\u2019s it? Everything\u2019s sold out?\nLeonard: Yeah.\nHoward: I can\u2019t believe we\u2019re not going.\nSheldon: It\u2019s okay. You know, there, there\u2019s always WonderCon in Anaheim, you know? That, that\u2019s just as good. Excuse me.\nPenny: Oh, guys, this is really sad. And in a different way than it was twenty minutes ago.\nSheldon: I can\u2019t believe we wasted all that time on our Hulk costumes.\nPenny: What? You were all going as the Hulk?\nHoward: Not the same Hulk. Ferrigno, Bana, Norton and Ruffalo.\nRaj: We would have been the angry green belles of the masquerade ball.\nAll: Yeah. \nPenny: And we\u2019re back to the first kind of sad.\nScene: The cafeteria.\nSheldon: Gentlemen, I have the solution to our Comic-Con problem. We don\u2019t need them. I\u2019m starting my own convention.\nLeonard: Sheldon, just buy scalped tickets with us.\nSheldon: I told you. Buying scalped tickets is against the rules. If you get caught, you get banned from Comic-Con for life. Life, Leonard. You\u2019re gonna feel pretty silly when we\u2019re 80 years old, and you have to drive me down there and then wait in the car for three days.\nLeonard: Do what you want. We\u2019re getting scalped tickets.\nHoward: I already found a guy online who\u2019s willing to sell.\nSheldon: How do you know this isn\u2019t a sting operation set up by the Comic-Con police?\nLeonard: The same way I know that the people in the TV set can\u2019t see me.\nHoward: Sheldon, just come with us. You\u2019re not gonna make your own convention.\nSheldon: You know, there was a time when Comic-Con didn\u2019t exist at all until one lone dreamer with a unique vision made it happen. And you mark my words, I\u2019m gonna rip that guy off.\nScene: The apartment. \nSheldon (on phone): Yes, I\u2019m starting my own comic book convention, and I thought that your client, Robert Downey Jr., would be perfect to appear on our first panel. Oh, well, now, why are you saying no? You haven\u2019t even asked him yet. You know, excuse me, but I sat through Iron Man 2. I believe he owes me two hours of his time. They hung up on me.\nLeonard: Did you tell them that you\u2019re holding your convention at a Marie Callender\u2019s, and that every panellist gets a free slice of pie?\nSheldon: I didn\u2019t even get to that part.\nLeonard: Look, even your friend Wil Wheaton thinks this is a waste of time.\nSheldon: Not true. Wil thinks this is a great idea. He was just concerned that he wasn\u2019t a big enough celebrity to headline such an amazing event. Also, that\u2019s the same day that he shampoos his beard.\nLeonard: Sheldon, buddy, I just don\u2019t think this is going to come together for you.\nSheldon: You don\u2019t know that. I still have plenty of solid leads on this list.\nLeonard: Good luck.\nSheldon: No, wait. I need you to call Stan Lee, Leonard Nimoy and Bill Nye the Science Guy, \u2019cause, legally, I\u2019m not allowed to. Oh, and, also, Carrie Fisher, you know, \u2019cause I hear he can be pretty nuts.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment.\nPenny: I can\u2019t believe Leonard is spending hundreds of dollars on scalped tickets. \nAmy: Last week, you spent that on a little dress. \nPenny: Yeah, but those tickets only get him into Comic-Con. That dress gets me into anywhere I want.\nBernadette: Those tickets were pretty expensive. I had to give Howie an advance on his allowance. Now he\u2019s never gonna put his toys away.\nAmy: Why can\u2019t they do something sensible like Sheldon and start their own comic book convention? Also, who wants to throw me out that window?\nBernadette: Well, while they\u2019re acting like teenagers, we could do something grown-up.\nAmy: Oh. You mean like a museum?\nPenny: Yes, like a museum, but anything else.\nBernadette: Oh, I know. There\u2019s a nice hotel not far from here where they do afternoon tea.\nAmy: Ooh, afternoon tea, how sophisticated of us.\nPenny: Oh, all right, if we\u2019re gonna be fancy, I should probably put on clean underwear.\nBernadette: La-dee-da, look who has clean underwear.\nPenny: No, we\u2019re gonna stop at Target on the way.\nScene: The apartment.\nRaj: Hey, since Sheldon\u2019s not going to Comic-Con, maybe we could find a cool trio to dress up as.\nLeonard: Mmm, what if we go as The Fantastic Four, and just tell people that the Invisible Girl is standing there with us.\nHoward: Oh, and I thought our days of pretending to be with women who don\u2019t exist were over.\nSheldon: Gentlemen, I am one step away from securing a huge guest for my convention.\nLeonard: Does that step include chloroform and a roll of duct tape?\nSheldon: I don\u2019t think that will be necessary for Mr. James Earl Jones. You heard me. The voice of Darth Vader, the Lion King\u2019s dad, and FYI, the guy who says, This is CNN. Which also sounds like Darth Vader.\nRaj: How are you gonna get James Earl Jones?\nSheldon: Simple. Earlier today, he tweeted that he\u2019s looking forward to going to his favourite sushi restaurant for dinner. I googled an interview from four years ago which was conducted in his favourite sushi restaurant. That\u2019s where he\u2019ll be, and that\u2019s where I\u2019m going, and\u2026\nHoward: And that\u2019s where Darth Vader\u2019s gonna pour soy sauce on your head.\nLeonard: Sheldon, I don\u2019t care if you get scalped tickets with us or not, but please don\u2019t be creepy and go stalking this poor guy. You\u2019re gonna get in trouble.\nSheldon: You\u2019re the ones who are going to get in trouble. You\u2019re buying non-transferable tickets. And from a stranger, no less. Not only can you get banned from Comic-Con, if caught, you could be charged with petty theft. You think about that while I\u2019m warning James Earl Jones about the danger of posting his location on Twitter. He got lucky this time. There are some weirdoes out there. (To the Imperial March theme) Bom, bom, bom, bom, badum, bom, badum. Bom, bom, bom, bom, badum, bom, badum. Bom, bom, badala, baba, badalum, bom, badala, bom, bom, forgot my keys, bom, bom, bom, bom, badum, bom, badum\u2026 \nScene: The same, later.\nHoward (on phone): Okay, great. Bye. Our friendly neighbourhood scalper says he\u2019s running late.\nRaj: Does he sound like a criminal?\nHoward: What do you mean?\nRaj: You know, did he say things like, youse guys, or, listen here, see?\nLeonard: Yes. He, he\u2019s late because he\u2019s on his way here from 1940.\nRaj: I\u2019m just saying, we don\u2019t know who this guy is. What if he wants to steal our money or our kidneys, or make a suit outof our skins?\nHoward: Why would someone want to make clothes out of your skin?\nRaj: I don\u2019t know. Maybe \u2019cause dark doesn\u2019t show the stains?\nLeonard: Well, now you\u2019re making me wonder if we should have met him at a neutral location.\nHoward: Why do you think I told him to come to your place?\nScene: Hotel tea room.\nAmy: There sure are a lot of little kids here.\nPenny: I can\u2019t believe we thought this would makes us feel grown up.\nBernadette: I can\u2019t believe the waiter thought I was your daughter.\nAmy: Well, last time I got dressed up and had tea was when I was five. Just me, my teddy bear, Raggedy Ann and my hamster. \nBernadette: That\u2019s cute.\nAmy: It was. Till my hamster ate all her babies. It got less cute really fast.\nBernadette: Should we leave?\nPenny: Well, there\u2019s a bar in the lobby.\nBernadette: I could go for a drink.\nAmy: Aw. Drinking in the afternoon, just like her mommy.\nScene: A sushi restaurant.\nJames Earl Jones: Let me guess. You like Star Wars. You know, I\u2019ve been in other movies. But you don\u2019t care about those, do you? I have one thing to say to people like you. I like Star Wars, too. Care to join me?\nSheldon: Thank you. My friend Leonard said if I bothered you while you were eating, you\u2019d think I was a creepy stalker.\nJames Earl Jones: Well, your friend Leonard sounds like a real weenie.\nSheldon: He is, Mr. Earl Jones, he is.\nScene: The apartment.\nRaj: Okay, so, I\u2019m on a Comic-Con message board, and there\u2019s a post from a guy where he says he got caught using someone else\u2019s badge, and Sheldon was right, he did get charged with petty theft. Guys, if I go to jail dressed as the Human Torch, that might send the wrong message.\nLeonard: Maybe this isn\u2019t a good idea.\nHoward: I can text the guy and tell him we changed our minds.\nRaj: Do it.\nHoward: Okay. We\u2019re officially not going to Comic-Con.\nLeonard: Hold on. We always do this. \nHoward: Do what?\nLeonard: Chicken out. We\u2019re, we\u2019re so afraid of getting into trouble that we never do anything wrong.\nRaj: That\u2019s \u2019cause we\u2019re the good guys.\nLeonard: Even Batman breaks the rules. \nRaj: You know I struggle with Batman.\nLeonard: I say, this one time, instead of wimping out, let\u2019s be badasses.\nRaj: Okay, I\u2019ll be a badass, but only if you pinky-swear to be one, too.\nLeonard: Howard, you in on this?\nHoward: No need. I\u2019m breaking rules all the time. \nLeonard: Name one.\nHoward: Last night. Drank my Pepto straight out of the bottle.\nRaj: What about that little cup they give you?\nHoward: Yeah. What about it?\nRaj: Are you impressed by that?\nLeonard: A little.\nRaj: Yeah, me, too.\nScene: The sushi restaurant.\nJames: You know, when I first read the script for Empire Strikes Back and Darth Vader told Luke he was his father, I thought for sure he was lying.\nSheldon: Me, too. But he wasn\u2019t, was he?\nJames: He was not. How messed up was that?\nSheldon: So messed up.\nJames: What do you say let\u2019s go have some fun? My wife\u2019s in New York, and I got a Lion King residual cheque burning a hole in my pocket.\nScene: The hotel bar.\nPenny: So, afternoon tea was a bust.\nAmy: On the bright side, every six-year-old there was jealous of my tiara. Not gonna lie, it felt good.\nPenny: Let me ask you a question, when did you guys start feeling grown up? \u2018Cause I am not sure I do.\nBernadette: Honestly, I thought when I got married I would, but I still kind of feel like I\u2019m pretending. It doesn\u2019t help that most of my clothes come from Gap Kids.\nPenny: Okay, so I\u2019m an adult, and the other day I saw an old man slip and fall down, and I laughed. I mean, I laughed hard. Like, like, out loud. If he was conscious, he would\u2019ve heard me.\nAmy: Gosh.\nPenny: I know. One of the tennis balls came off his walker and bounced right off his head. I mean, I, I almost wet myself. I guess you had to be there.\nAmy: I think I have you both beat. Imagine trying to feel like a grown-up when you\u2019ve never even been with a man.\nPenny: Okay, sex is not what makes you a grown-up.\nBernadette: Yeah. Or you\u2019d be the oldest one here.\nPenny: Really? Is that how you talk to your mother?\nScene: The apartment.\nHoward: He just parked. He\u2019s on his way up.\nLeonard: Good. This is exciting.\nRaj: It is. I feel alive.\nLeonard: Yeah. What if we do get caught, who cares? So we get banned from Comic-Con.\nRaj: Maybe slapped with a fine.\nHoward: Oh, no. I\u2019d be an astronaut and a bad boy, how will women keep their pants on?\nRaj: Uh, maybe it\u2019ll come up when I apply for citizenship. Oh, crap, what if it comes up when I apply for citizenship? \nLeonard: I wonder if we\u2019d have to disclose something like this when we apply for grants.\nRaj: He\u2019s gonna be here any second, what should we do?\nHoward: Okay, you guys are such babies. I\u2019ll handle this. If he thinks we\u2019re not home, he\u2019ll go away.\nRaj: I thought you were a badass.\nHoward: I lied about the Pepto, I always use the little cup.\nScene: An ice cream parlour.\nSheldon: Is it true, as a child, you were a stutterer and were functionally mute for eight years?\nJames: It is true.\nSheldon: Oh. Is it true they used scuba gear to create the sound of Darth Vader breathing?\nJames: They sure did.\nSheldon: Oh. Is it true that you were pre-med in college and you almost became a doctor?\nJames: That\u2019s right.\nSheldon: Oh, James, I could listen to your stories all night.\nScene: The hotel bar.\nPenny: I mean, really, what\u2019s so great about being grown up?\nBernadette: Well, for starters, we\u2019d be splitting this check three ways.\nPenny: I\u2019m serious. Who wants to do all that stuff? Have insurance, pay mortgages, leave one of those little notes when you hit a parked car.\nAmy: I told you it was Penny.\nPenny: Oh, come on, it wasn\u2019t me. Anyone could have knocked your mirror off, or whatever happened.\nAmy: Maybe the guys are right. I mean, we spent the whole night trying to be mature, and it was kind of boring. I\u2019m sure they\u2019re having more fun than we are.\nScene: The apartment. Banging on door.\nHoward: Oh, God, I could really use exactly two tablespoons of Pepto right now.\nScene: A big wheel.\nSheldon: Hey, Los Angeles. I\u2019m on a Ferris Wheel with Darth Vader. And he\u2019s nicer than you think.\nJames: I am.\nScene: A karaoke bar.\nSheldon: In the jungle, the mighty jungle, the lion sleeps tonight\u2026\nJames: Ah-wimoweh, ah-wimoweh\u2026\nSheldon: Bring it home, Mufasa. Eee, eee, eee, eee, eee, um, um-a-weh.\nJames: Ah-wimoweh, ah-wimoweh\u2026\nSceme: Outside a house.\nSheldon: I don\u2019t understand what we\u2019re doing.\nJames: Shh.\nSheldon: Whose house is this?\nJames: Carrie Fisher. And she\u2019s a little crazy, so get ready to run. (Rings doorbell)\nCarrie Fisher: It\u2019s not funny anymore, James.\nJames: Then why am I laughing?\nScene: A sauna.\nJames: Ah, Sheldon, this is the perfect end to a perfect night.\nSheldon: Okay. But I think it could have ended with the karaoke.\nJames: What were you trying to ask me at the strip club?\nSheldon: Oh. How much does it cost to get them off my lap?\nJames: No. Something about a convention.\nSheldon: Oh, right. Well, my friends and I couldn\u2019t get into Comic-Con this year, and I was trying to start my own convention, and I was going to ask if you would be a panelist.\nJames: Why don\u2019t you and your friends come to Comic-Con with me?\nSheldon: Really?\nJames: Of course. And San Diego is right across the border from my favorite city on Earth, Tijuana, where I\u2019m taking you every night. \nSheldon: Ay-yi-yi. \nJames: Ay-yi-yi, bang-bang.\nScene: The same, later.\nJames: So, Beau Bridges is on my shoulders, and Jeff Bridges is on Marlon Brando\u2019s shoulders, and remember, we do not have permission to be in the pool\u2026 hey, Sheldon, wake up. And Angie Dickinson is about to sic the dogs on us, and I go under the water and Marlon goes under the water, and the water raises about two feet and sloshes all over her patio, and the dogs freak out and run like hell, and then we run like hell. Oh, boy, that was a lot of fun.\nSheldon: I\u2019m sorry, who\u2019s Angie Dickinson?\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "3_14": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The apartment. Sheldon is stood in the middle of the room. His whiteboard is behind him. Every few moments he turns round suddently.\nPenny: Whatcha doing?\nSheldon: I\u2019m attempting to view my work as a fleeting peripheral image so as to engage the superior colliculus of my brain.\nPenny: Interesting. I usually just have coffee. You\u2019ve been up all night?\nSheldon: Is it morning?\nPenny: Yes.\nSheldon: Then I\u2019ve been up all night.\nPenny: And you\u2019re stuck?\nSheldon: Why else would a person try to engage their superior colliculus?\nPenny: Oh, sorry, sweetie, I can\u2019t help you till I\u2019ve had my coffee.\nLeonard: Penny, I told you if you don\u2019t put him in his crate at night he just runs around the apartment.\nPenny: What is he doing now?\nLeonard: Mmm, he\u2019s either isolating the terms of his formula and examining them individually, or looking for the alligator that swallowed his hand after Peter Pan cut it off.\nSheldon: Captain Hook\u2019s hand was eaten by a crocodile, not an alligator. If you\u2019re going to mock me, at least get your facts straight.\nLeonard: Aye, aye, Captain.\nSheldon: I can\u2019t see it! It just won\u2019t coalesce.\nLeonard: Maybe you need a fresh start.\nSheldon: You\u2019re right. (Takes whiteboard to window and throws it out. Picks up a new one) It\u2019s a great idea, Leonard. Thank you.\nCredits sequence. \nScene: The cafeteria.\nSheldon: Electrons move through graphene, act as if they have no mass\u2026\nHoward: How long has he been stuck?\nLeonard: Intellectually about 30 hours. Emotionally about 29 years.\nSheldon: Unit cell contains two carbon atoms. Interior angle of a hexagon is 120 degrees.\nHoward: Have you tried rebooting him?\nLeonard: No, I think it\u2019s a firmware problem.\nRaj (arriving): Hey, it\u2019s Disco Night at the Moonlight Roller Rink in Glendale tonight. Who\u2019s up for getting down?\nHoward: Oh, that\u2019s perfect. Bernadette\u2019s been hocking me to take her roller skating.\nLeonard: I think Penny likes to skate. The four of us could double.\nHoward: What could be better? We\u2019re in.\nRaj: Great. It\u2019s not like I brought it up because I wanted to go.\nHoward: You can come with us.\nRaj: No, it\u2019s okay. I don\u2019t have to go. I\u2019m happy just to guide you and your ladies to suitable entertainment choices. I\u2019m a walking brown Yelp.com.\nSheldon: Structure, constant structure. One atom\u2026\nHoward: Boy, he\u2019s really gone, isn\u2019t he?\nLeonard: Yeah, this morning he used a stick of butter as deodorant.\nHoward: I thought I smelled popcorn.\nSheldon: Pattern is the same as fermions, travels on the pathways, hexagonal, it\u2019s always hexagonal\u2026\nLeonard: I haven\u2019t seen him this stuck since he tried to figure out the third Matrix movie.\nRaj (as Sheldon reaches out and grabs from his plate): Hey, those are my lima beans!\nSheldon: Not lima beans, carbon atoms.\nRaj: But if I don\u2019t eat my lima beans, I can\u2019t have my cookie.\nLeonard: Here, you want my peas?\nSheldon: Peas! Perfect, they can be electrons.\nHoward: Want my corn?\nSheldon: Don\u2019t be ridiculous. What would I do with corn?\nLeonard: So roller skating, should we all grab a bite to eat first?\nHoward: Good. P.F. Chang\u2019s? My mom has coupons.\nLeonard: Great. Your mom\u2019s not coming, right?\nHoward: Not this time, I promise.\nRaj: Okay, just to be clear, roller skating was my idea, and I\u2019m very unhappy that you turned it into a double date, and I hope you both fall on your asses and break your coccyxes.\nSheldon: The plural of coccyx is coccyges.\nRaj: Screw you. Give me back my lima beans.\nScene: The stairwell.\nBernadette: Oh, my God, have you ever been so embarrassed?\nPenny: Not recently.\nBernadette: I don\u2019t know which was lamer, their roller-skating or their disco dancing.\nPenny: For me, the worst part was when people saw us leave with them.\nLeonard: You had some nice moves out there, Howard.\nHoward: Thanks. You, too.\nLeonard: Yeah. Did you notice all the people looking at us?\nHoward: Not really. I was in my boogie zone.\nBernadette: When Howard tried to do the splits\u2026\nPenny: Shh.\nLeonard: Sorry. I\u2019m moving a little slow. I think I bruised my coccyx.\nPenny: Oh, poor baby.\nLeonard: Don\u2019t tell Koothrappali. After you.\nPenny: Oh, what a gentleman. Hey, Sheldon. (Steps on marbles which are all over the floor, screams and falls)\nLeonard: Oh, my God! Are you\u2026 (falls as well)\nSheldon: Good Lord! You\u2019re ruining everything!\nPenny: Oh, damn.\nLeonard: Are you okay?\nPenny: Do I look okay?\nLeonard: Don\u2019t bark at me. I fell, too.\nPenny: Oh, you\u2019ve been falling all night. You\u2019re used to it.\nHoward: Sheldon, what the hell are you doing?\nSheldon: The same thing I\u2019ve been doing for three days. Trying to figure out why electrons behave as if they have no mass when travelling through a graphene sheet.\nBernadette: With marbles?\nSheldon: Well, I needed something bigger than peas, now, didn\u2019t I?\nBernadette: Sheldon, when was the last time you got any sleep?\nSheldon: I don\u2019t know, two, three days. Not important. I don\u2019t need sleep, I need answers. I need to determine where in this swamp of unbalanced formulas squatteth the toad of truth.\nPenny: Toad of truth? Is that a physics thing?\nLeonard: No, that\u2019s a crazy thing.\nBernadette: Okay, Sheldon. What happens to our neuroreceptors when we don\u2019t get enough REM sleep?\nSheldon: They lose their sensitivity to serotonin and norepinephrine.\nBernadette: Which leads to\u2026?\nSheldon: Impaired cognitive function.\nBernadette: Right, so march in there, brush your teeth and go to bed.\nSheldon: But I don\u2019t want to go to bed.\nBernadette: I\u2019m going to count to three. One\u2026\nSheldon: Oh, all right.\nLeonard: That was amazing how you handled him.\nBernadette: I know how to deal with stubborn children. My mother used to run an illegal day care centre in our basement.\nScene: Leonard\u2019s bedroom.\n \nPenny: Leonard, you\u2019re\u2026 you\u2019re giggling in your sleep.\nLeonard: It\u2019s not me, it\u2019s my new ringtone. The Joker from Batman.\nPenny: Well, it creeps me out.\nLeonard: Me, too, but I paid three bucks for it.\nPenny: Just answer the phone.\nLeonard: Hello. Yeah, I\u2019m Leonard Hofstadter. Yeah, yeah, he\u2019s my roommate. Oh, God, is he okay? Yeah, alright, alright, I\u2019ll be right there.\nPenny: What happened?\nLeonard: Sheldon\u2019s escaped and is terrorizing the village.\nPenny: Okay. Have fun.\nScene: A children\u2019s play area.\nLeonard: Hi. I\u2019m Dr. Hofstadter. Where is he?\nSecurity Guard: Ball pit.\nLeonard: Thanks for not calling the cops.\nSecurity Guard: Oh, hey, it\u2019s no big deal. My sister\u2019s got a kid who\u2019s special.\nLeonard: Yeah, well, he\u2019s extra special. Hey, Shelly. What you doing?\nSheldon: Size ratio was all wrong. Couldn\u2019t visualize it. Needed bigger carbon atoms.\nLeonard: Sure, sure. How did you get into this place?\nSheldon: Back door has a five-pin tumbler system, single-circuit alarm. Child\u2019s play. You can start sorting protons and neutrons while I build carbon atoms.\nLeonard: No, I don\u2019t think so. We need to go home now.\nSheldon: But I\u2019m still working.\nLeonard: If you don\u2019t come out of there, I\u2019m going to have to drag you out.\nSheldon: You can try, but you\u2019ll never catch me. (He disappears under the balls)\nLeonard: For God\u2019s sakes. Sheldon, come here!\nSheldon (popping his head up): Bazinga. (Disappears, pops up in another place) Bazinga. (And again) Bazinga. (And again) Bazinga. (And again) Bazinga.\nScene: Leonard\u2019s bedroom. Sheldon is standing over their bed. He knocks on the wall. \n \nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard and Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard and Penny.\nLeonard (Waking up as Penny screams): What! What, what, what?\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard and Penny. \nLeonard: What?\nSheldon: I have good news.\nLeonard: And you had to barge in here and wake us up in the middle of the night?\nSheldon: Your cell phone was off.\nLeonard: Because we didn\u2019t want to be disturbed.\nSheldon: And that didn\u2019t work out, did it?\nPenny: Sheldon, what do you want?\nSheldon: I came to tell you I\u2019ve got the answer.\nLeonard: Really? You figured out the graphene problem?\nSheldon: No, no, I\u2019m still hopelessly stuck on that, but I figured out how to figure it out.\nPenny: Hey, you know what, Leonard, I know I said I could handle your roommate, but I was wrong. We\u2019re going to have to break up.\nLeonard: What are you talking about?\nPenny (as Sheldon sits on the bed): Oh.\nSheldon: Einstein.\nLeonard: Yeah, I\u2019m going to need a little more.\nSheldon: Albert Einstein.\nLeonard: Keep going.\nSheldon: When Albert Einstein came up with special relativity, he was working at the patent office.\nLeonard: So, you\u2019re going to go work at the patent office?\nSheldon: Don\u2019t be absurd. That\u2019s in Washington. You know I could never live in a city whose streets are laid out in a wheel-and-spoke pattern. No. I\u2019m going to find a similarly menial job where my basal ganglia are occupied with a routine task, freeing my prefrontal cortex to work quietly in the background on my problem.\nLeonard: Sounds like a great plan.\nSheldon: Of course it is. Even talking to you is sufficiently menial that I can feel the proverbial juices starting to flow.\nLeonard: Okay, well, thanks for sharing with us. Good night.\nSheldon: You\u2019re welcome. Good night to you, too. Oh, by the way, I was watching you sleep for a moment, and I noticed that your snoring seems to be worse when you\u2019re on your back.\nPenny: Leonard doesn\u2019t snore.\nSheldon: No, I wasn\u2019t talking to Leonard.\nLeonard: Told you.\nScene: An employment office\nEmployment Office Assistant: So, Mr. Cooper, you\u2019re looking for a job.\nSheldon: A menial job. Like yours.\nAssistant: Why, thank you for noticing. I\u2019m Menial Employee of the Month. Do you have a particular field in mind?\nSheldon: I do. For thousands of years, the lowest classes of the human race have spent their lives labouring to erect monuments under the lash of their betters, until finally they dropped down and became one with the dust through which they trudged. Do you have anything like that?\nAssistant: No.\nSheldon: Shouldn\u2019t you check your database?\nAssistant (clicks her keyboard a few times): No.\nSheldon: You didn\u2019t really type.\nAssistant: I didn\u2019t really have to. So, how about construction?\nSheldon: Oh, that would be good! Sawing, hammering, eating out of a lunch pail as my working-class fellows and I sit perched precariously on a girder high above the metropolis.\nAssistant: No, no. This is putting up sheetrock at a housing project in Rosemead.\nSheldon: I could do that.\nAssistant: Good.\nSheldon: One question.\nAssistant: Yes?\nSheldon: What\u2019s sheetrock?\nAssistant: Moving on. How about doing deliveries for a florist?\nSheldon: That seems acceptable.\nAssistant: Do you have your own car?\nSheldon: I don\u2019t drive.\nAssistant: Of course you don\u2019t. Mr. Cooper, let me just ask you a question. What was your last job?\nSheldon: Senior theoretical particle physicist at CalTech, focusing on M theory, or, in layman\u2019s terms, string theory.\nAssistant: I see. Just give me a second. Security!\nScene: The Cheesecake Factory.\nPenny: Okay, I\u2019ll get those drinks started for you.\nSheldon (appearing in an apron and carrying a tray): Behind you.\nPenny: Sheldon, what the hell are you doing?\nSheldon: I\u2019m trying to get these tables cleared. We\u2019re slammed.\nPenny: No, wait, wait, no, wait. Wh.. what are you doing here?\nSheldon: A reasonable question. I asked myself, what is the most mind-numbing, pedestrian job conceivable, and three answers came to mind, uh, toll booth attendant, an Apple Store genius, and what Penny does. Now, since I don\u2019t like touching other people\u2019s coins, and I refuse to contribute to the devaluation of the word genius, here I am.\nPenny: You just, you just walked in and they hired you, just like that?\nSheldon: Oh, heavens, no. Since I don\u2019t need to be paid, I didn\u2019t need to be hired. I simply came in, picked up a tray, and started working for the man. Let me get that plate out of your way.\nPenny: Sheldon, this is ridiculous.\nSheldon: Is it? Just a moment ago I had a minor epiphany regarding the polymer degradation phenomenon while scraping congealed nachos off a plate. Bernadette, table 10 wants their check.\nBernadette: Thanks, Sheldon.\nPenny: Sheldon, wait, this isn\u2019t even what I do. I\u2019m a waitress, not a busboy.\nSheldon: You\u2019re right. That is more menial. Hello, I\u2019m Sheldon. I\u2019ll be your server today. I don\u2019t recommend the salmon. I saw it in the kitchen.\nScene: The same, later.\nSheldon: All right, one bacon cheeseburger, breaking two Jewish dietary restrictions simultaneously, kudos. Beer-battered fish and chips. Now, here\u2019s your tartar sauce. I also brought you salsa. It\u2019s a little unconventional, but I think you\u2019ll like it. It\u2019s zingy. And for you, Factory Burrito Grande, no cheese, no sour cream, no ugly consequences from your lactose intolerance. Bon app\u00e9tit.\nLeonard: Hang on. Black beans, not pinto beans?\nSheldon: Yes.\nLeonard: Double guacamole?\nSheldon: Of course.\nLeonard: No cilantro?\nSheldon: Nope.\nLeonard: Lettuce shredded, not chopped?\nSheldon: Yep.\nLeonard: You understand why I\u2019m doing this to you?\nSheldon: I do.\nLeonard: That\u2019ll be all. That was fun.\nRaj: How long can he keep this up?\nLeonard: I heard about this professor at MIT who melted down, bought a van, and spent the rest of his life as a mobile dog groomer.\nRaj: He never went back to the university?\nLeonard: Only to shampoo Professor Chambourg\u2019s shih tzu.\nRaj: Sheesh.\nHoward: I bet if we all chipped in, we could buy Sheldon a van.\nRaj: But he\u2019s afraid of dogs.\nLeonard: Yeah, that\u2019s the only thing wrong with that plan.\nPenny: Hey, guys, sorry you had to wait, but we are swamped. What\u2019s this?\nLeonard: Sheldon took our order.\nPenny: Sheldon doesn\u2019t work here.\nLeonard: Well, honey, not to complain, but we were starting to think you didn\u2019t either.\nSheldon (drops tray. A nearby table claps): Is that really necessary? Good Lord. The interference pattern in the fracture. The motion of the wave through the molecular structure. I\u2019ve been looking at it all wrong. I can\u2019t consider the electrons as particles. They move through the graphene as a wave. It\u2019s a wave! The moment to applaud would be now. Troglodytes.\nPenny: Sheldon, where are you going? Aren\u2019t you going to clean this up?\nSheldon: I\u2019m sorry. I don\u2019t work here.\nScene: The roller disco. \nHoward: Happy now?\nRaj: I\u2019m on a cloud. Swing me. (Howard swings Raj several times.)\nScene: The ball pit, presumably earlier. \nLeonard: Sheldon, come here.\n(Sheldon once again keeps popping up his head and shouting \u201cBazinga\u201d as Leonard flails around trying to catch him.)\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "4_1": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The apartment. A robotic arm is extracting some Chinese takeaway from a bag controlled by Howard.\n \nHoward: And now the kung pao chicken.\nLeonard: Alright.\nRaj: Smooth.\nHoward: And finally, my moo shu pork.\nRaj: Whoo-hoo!\nHoward: Ah, there you have it, gentlemen. Our entire dinner unpacked by robot.\nRaj: And it only took 28 minutes.\nSheldon: Impressive, but we must be cautious.\nHoward: Why?\nSheldon: Today, it\u2019s a Chinese food retrieval robot. Tomorrow, it travels back in time and tries to kill Sarah Connor.\nLeonard: I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to happen, Sheldon.\nSheldon: No one ever does. That\u2019s why it happens.\nPenny (arriving): Hey. Is the food here? Ooh. What\u2019s that?\nHoward: That, dear lady, is the Wolowitz Programmable Hand, designed for extravehicular repairs on the International Space Station.\nPenny: Ah, cool.\nHoward: Ask me to pass the soy sauce.\nPenny: Oh, does that come up much on the space station?\nHoward: Mostly with Asian and Jewish astronauts.\nPenny: All right. Pass the soy sauce.\nHoward: Coming up. (Starts typing rapidly)\nLeonard: So how\u2019s work?\nPenny: Oh, it\u2019s not bad. Kind of hungry.\nLeonard: Yeah, we all are.\nHoward: Just wait.\nSheldon: You realize, Penny, that the technology that went into this arm will one day make unskilled food servers such as yourself obsolete.\nPenny: Really? They\u2019re going to make a robot that spits on your hamburger?\nSheldon: I thought you broke up with her. Why is she here?\nHoward: Okay, here we go. Passing the soy sauce. Put out your hand.\nPenny: Oh ha-ha, oh. That\u2019s amazing.\nSheldon: I wouldn\u2019t say amazing. At best, it\u2019s a modest leap forward from the basic technology that gave us Country Bear Jamboree.\nHoward: Hey, Sheldon?\nSheldon: Yes? (Howard types. The hand puts up two fingers to Sheldon.) Peace?\nHoward: No, not peace. Hang on.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: A few moments later.\nPenny: Does NASA know you\u2019re using that thing as a napkin holder?\nHoward: You kidding? They still think it\u2019s in a secure locker at JPL.\nPenny: You stole it?\nHoward: Borrowed. The trick is to carry it out to your car like you own it.\nSheldon (phone gives text alert): Excuse me. Oh. Amy\u2019s at the dry cleaners, and she\u2019s made a very amusing pun. \u201cI don\u2019t care for perchloroethylene, and I don\u2019t like glycol ether.\u201d Get it? She doesn\u2019t like glycol ether. Sounds like either. (Taps in reply) L-O-L.\nPenny: Who\u2019s Amy?\nLeonard: His girlfriend.\nPenny: Sheldon has a girlfriend?\nSheldon: She\u2019s not my girlfriend.\nPenny: How long has this been going on?\nLeonard: Four months.\nSheldon: She\u2019s not my girlfriend.\nPenny: Are you telling me, for the past four months I have been asking you what\u2019s new and you never thought to go with Sheldon has a girlfriend?\nSheldon: She\u2019s not my girlfriend.\nPenny: Ah, du-du-du-du-du. How did they meet?\nHoward: Raj and I entered Sheldon\u2019s information on a dating site, and it spit out Amy Farrah Fowler.\nPenny: Oh, my God! Sheldon and Amy.\nHoward: Or, as we call them, Shamy.\nPenny (squeals): Shamy. I am so digging the Shamy.\nSheldon: All right, everyone pay attention. Yes, I have a friend named Amy Farrah Fowler. Yes, she is female. Yes, we communicate on a daily basis, but no, she is not my girlfriend.\nPenny: Okay, well, what do you communicate about?\nSheldon: Well, my work in physics, her work in neurobiology, and most recently, the possibility of our having a child together.\nPenny (spits out drink explosively. Howard types. Robot arm hands Penny a napkin): Thank you.\nLeonard: Wait a minute\u2013 a child? You never see this girl. You just e-mail and text and Twitter. Now you\u2019re considering having a baby?\nSheldon: Amy pointed out that between the two of us, our genetic material has the potential of producing the first in a line of intellectually superior, benign overlords to guide humanity to a brighter tomorrow.\nHoward: I\u2019m guessing that future historians will condemn us for not taking this opportunity to kill Sheldon.\nPenny: Okay, I have a question.\nSheldon: Yes, Penny.\nPenny: You don\u2019t even like people touching you. How are you going to have sex?\nSheldon: Why on Earth would we have sex?\nPenny: Oh, honey, did your mom not have the talk with you? You know, when your private parts started growing?\nSheldon: I\u2019m quite aware of the way humans usually reproduce, which is messy, unsanitary, and based on living next to you for three years, involves loud and unnecessary appeals to a deity.\nPenny: Oh, God.\nSheldon: Yes, exactly. Consequently, if Amy and I choose to bring new life into this world, it will be accomplished clinically, with fertility experts in a lab with petri dishes. Which reminds me, you have broad hips and a certain corn-fed vigour. Is your womb available for rental?\nLeonard: Still digging the Shamy?\nPenny: Look, Sheldon, before you race off to the fertility clinic, you might want to think about, uh gee, I don\u2019t know, maybe actually spending some time with her.\nSheldon: You mean dating?\nPenny: Yeah.\nSheldon: I can\u2019t date Amy.\nPenny: Why not?\nSheldon: She\u2019s not my girlfriend.\nPenny: Okay, look, don\u2019t think of it as dating a girlfriend. Think of it as, uh, getting to know the future mother of your child.\nSheldon: Oh. I hadn\u2019t considered that. I suppose she will have to have access to our progeny. And you don\u2019t think I can achieve the required intimacy via text messaging?\nPenny: Probably not.\nSheldon: Huh. It would appear as if the phone companies have been lying to me.\nScene: The hallway.\n \nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny.\nPenny: You do realize I stand on the other side of the door waiting for you to finish knocking three times.\nSheldon: I know. I can see the shadow of your feet under the door.\nPenny: Yeah, my point is it\u2019s a waste of time.\nSheldon: If you\u2019re looking for an example of a waste of time, I would refer you to the conversation we\u2019re having right now.\nPenny: What do you want?\nSheldon: I\u2019ve decided to take your advice and have arranged to go on a date with Amy Farrah Fowler.\nPenny: Oh, that\u2019s great. Have fun.\nSheldon: Wait. You have to drive me.\nPenny: What?\nSheldon: You know I don\u2019t drive.\nPenny: Well, go ask Leonard.\nSheldon: I did. He said, and I quote, ask Penny, it was her cockamamie idea.\nPenny: Leonard said cockamamie?\nSheldon: Actually, I\u2019m paraphrasing. Having been raised in a Christian household, I\u2019m uncomfortable with the language he used. And to be honest, I\u2019m not entirely comfortable with cockamamie.\nPenny: Okay, fine. When\u2019s the date?\nSheldon: Now.\nPenny: Now?\nSheldon: Hurry. We\u2019re going to be late.\nPenny: Sheldon, did it ever occur to you that I might have other plans?\nSheldon: I\u2019m sorry. Do you have other plans?\nPenny: Well, no, not per se, but\u2026\nSheldon: So this conversation is as pointless as your door-knocking soliloquy?\nPenny: Let me get my cockamamie keys.\nScene: Howard\u2019s bedroom. Howard is being massaged by the robot hand.\nHoward: Oh, God, that feels so good. Yeah, that\u2019s the spot. Oh, baby.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Howard, dinner\u2019s ready!\nHoward: I\u2019ll eat later. I\u2019m busy! Oh, yeah. Just like a real hand. Hmm.\nScene: Penny\u2019s car.\nSheldon: Thank you for driving me.\nPenny: You\u2019re welcome.\nSheldon: I wish you weren\u2019t wearing flip-flops. It\u2019s dangerous to drive in flip-flops.\nPenny: Sheldon.\nSheldon: Sorry. I just don\u2019t want to be yet another flip-flop fatality.\nPenny: Can I ask you a question?\nSheldon: Given your community college education, I encourage you to ask me as many as possible.\nPenny: Yeah. Well, my question is, and I\u2019m pretty sure I know the answer, is this your first date?\nSheldon: That depends. Does square-dancing with my sister at a Teens for Jesus Fourth of July Hoedown count as a date?\nPenny: No.\nSheldon: Then, this is my first date.\nPenny: Okay. Well, then, there\u2019s a couple of things you should probably know.\nSheldon: I have a master\u2019s degree and two doctorates. The things I should know, I do know.\nPenny: My point is, I know more about dating than you, and if you were as smart as you think you are, you would listen to me.\nSheldon: If you know so much, how come I have a date tonight and you have nothing better to do than drive me to it?\nPenny: Fair point.\nScene: The apartment.\nRaj: You know, there\u2019s something I\u2019ve always wondered about Aquaman.\nLeonard: Yeah?\nRaj: Where does he poop?\nLeonard: What?\nRaj: What would a toilet look like in Atlantis? How would you flush it? And when you did flush it, where would the poop go?\nLeonard (phone rings): Hold that thought. Hey, Howard, what\u2019s going on? What? Hold on, Howard, Howard, slow down. The robot hand is stuck on your what? (To Raj) You\u2019re not going to believe this.\nScene: Penny\u2019s car. Amy is now in the back seat.\nPenny: So, um, Amy, Sheldon tells me you\u2019re a neuro something-or-other.\nAmy: Neurobiologist. Your check engine light is on.\nPenny: Yeah, it\u2019s okay.\nAmy: But the light indicates\u2026\nSheldon: Don\u2019t bother. I\u2019ve wasted many an hour tilting at that particular windmill.\nPenny: Um, what is that scent you\u2019re wearing? It smells great.\nAmy: Dandruff shampoo. I have dry scalp.\nPenny: Ah. Well, your hair looks very nice.\nAmy: Are you a homosexual?\nPenny: No, no, I was just giving you a compliment.\nAmy: Hmm. Would have been more flattered if you were a homosexual.\nPenny: Guys, how \u2019bout some music?\nSheldon: Oh, no, I wouldn\u2019t care for that. Amy?\nAmy: No, thank you.\nPenny: Okay. Uncomfortable silence it is. Hey, Sheldon, have you told Amy what it was like for you growing up in Texas?\nSheldon: No.\nPenny: Well, why don\u2019t you tell her?\nSheldon: All right. It was hell.\nPenny: Any follow up, Amy?\nAmy: No.\nPenny: I myself grew up in Nebraska. Small town outside of Omaha. You know, nice place, mostly family farms, a few meth labs.\nSheldon: I\u2019m sorry, how is this better than uncomfortable silence?\nPenny: I don\u2019t know. I was just trying something.\nSheldon: Muggles.\nScene: Howard\u2019s bedroom.\nRaj: You slipped and fell into a robot hand?\nHoward: Yes.\nRaj: Penis first?\nHoward: Yes. Now, help me!\nLeonard: I\u2019d suggest a lubricant, but I have a feeling you fell on some of that as well.\nHoward: Not funny, Leonard.\nRaj: Really? A robot hand\u2019s got a death grip on your junk, dude. That\u2019s funny, ask anyone.\nHoward: Please, before my mother walks in, just get this off me!\nLeonard: Okay, let\u2019s see.\nHoward: No, no! Don\u2019t touch, the program is paused.\nLeonard: Well, then let\u2019s un-pause it.\nHoward: No, no! I loaded the wrong program. The hand thinks it\u2019s holding a screwdriver in outer space. If you continue the program, it\u2019s gonna start twisting.\nRaj: A-All right, um, how about this. When, when Winnie the Pooh got his head stuck in the honey tree, his friends all grabbed onto him and pulled and pulled.\nLeonard: You do what you want, I\u2019m not touching another man\u2019s honey tree.\nRaj: All right, uh, forget pulling. How about we get an electric saw and cut it off?\nHoward: What? No saws! One circumcision was enough.\nLeonard: How about an acetylene torch?\nHoward: Okay, I can\u2019t believe this needs to be said out loud. No pulling, no saws, no torches.\nLeonard: Well, then what do you want us to do?\nHoward: I\u2026\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Howard, I made cookies for you and your little friends!\nHoward: That\u2019s great, Mom, thanks!\nMrs Wolowitz (off): I\u2019ll bring them up with some Hawaiian Punch!\nHoward: Don\u2019t come up here!\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Why not?! Are you ashamed of your mother?!\nHoward: Yes, but that\u2019s not the point! Get me out of here.\nLeonard: You have any ideas, Raj?\nRaj: Right now, all I can think about is cookies and Hawaiian Punch.\nScene: A restaurant.\nPenny: Hey, here\u2019s another possible topic of conversation. This is a big night for Sheldon. Right, Sheldon?\nSheldon: Big night? The winter solstice is a big night. It\u2019s over 14 hours in Southern California.\nAmy: That\u2019s an amusing factoid.\nSheldon: Thank you.\nPenny: No, no. My point is, uh, tonight is Sheldon\u2019s first official date. Discuss.\nAmy: Is this true?\nSheldon: Apparently, a semi-incestuous Teens for Jesus Fourth of July Hoedown didn\u2019t count.\nPenny: So, um, Amy, what about you? Do you date much?\nAmy: Once a year. It\u2019s a deal I made with my mother in exchange for her silence on the matter, as well as the occasional use of her George Foreman Grill that seals in the flavour without the fat. How about you, Penny? Do you go on many dates?\nPenny: Uh, yeah, I wouldn\u2019t say many. A few. (Sheldon laugh\u2019s strangely). What\u2019s (imitates Sheldon\u2019s laugh)\n \nSheldon: Your characterization of approximately 171 different men as a few.\nPenny: What? Where did you get 171 men?\nSheldon: Simple extrapolation. In the three years that I\u2019ve known you, you were single for two. During that time, I saw 17 different suitors. If we work backwards, correcting for observation bias and postulate an initial dating age of 15\u2026\nPenny: Whoa, wait, wait, wait. I did not start dating at 15.\nSheldon: I\u2019m sorry. 16?\nPenny: 14.\nSheldon: My mistake. Now, assuming the left side of a bell curve peaking around the present, that would bring the total up to 193 men. Plus or minus eight men.\nAmy: Remarkable. Did you have sexual intercourse with all of these men?\nPenny: No.\nSheldon: Although that number would be fairly easy to calculate.\nPenny: Oh.\nSheldon: Based on the number of awkward encounters I\u2019ve had with strange men leaving her apartment in the morning, plus the number of times she\u2019s returned home wearing the same clothes she wore the night before\u2026\nPenny: Okay, Sheldon, I think you\u2019ve made your point.\nSheldon: So we multiply 193, minus 21 men before the loss of virginity, so 172 times 0.18 gives us 30.96 sexual partners. Let\u2019s round that up to 31.\nPenny: Okay, Sheldon, you are so wrong. That is not even close to the real number. I\u2019m gonna need a drink over here.\nAmy: This is very interesting. Cultural perceptions are subjective. Penny, to your mind, are you a slut?\nPenny: No! No! No. Let\u2019s just all finish our dinners, okay?\nSheldon: This is an interesting topic. How many sexual encounters have you had?\nAmy: Does volunteering for a scientific experiment in which orgasm was achieved by electronically stimulating the pleasure centres of the brain count?\nSheldon: I should think so.\nAmy: Then 128.\nScene: A hospital,=.\nLeonard: Okay, come on. Almost there.\nHoward: Don\u2019t tug. No tugging.\nRaj: Next time, take your own advice.\nLeonard: Excuse me, could you help us out?\nNurse: My, my, my. What do we have here?\nHoward: I slipped and fell.\nNurse: Yeah, we get that a lot. What is this?\nHoward: It\u2019s a robot arm.\nNurse: Where\u2019s the rest of the robot?\nHoward: I only built the arm.\nNurse: \u2018Cause that\u2019s all you needed, right?\nHoward: Can you please just help me?\nNurse: All right, all right. Hang on, stay calm. (Over PA system)  I need an orderly with a wheelchair. I got a robot hand grasping a man\u2019s penis out here.\nHoward: You think you could be a little more discreet?\nNurse: I\u2019m sorry, we don\u2019t have a code for robot hand grasping a man\u2019s penis. Why is it hooked up to a computer?\nLeonard: Uh, it\u2019s what controls the arm.\nHoward: But it\u2019s frozen.\nNurse: Did you try turning it off and back on again?\nHoward: No, you see, it\u2019s more complicated than that. (Nurse switches off computer) No, wait! (The hand lets go) Winnie the Pooh is out of the honey tree.\nRaj: Now can we have cookies and Hawaiian Punch?\nScene: The stairwell. \nSheldon: You were right. This was a very productive evening. I saw a whole new side of Amy Farrah Fowler tonight.\nPenny: I did not have sex with 31 guys.\nSheldon: I\u2019ll be happy to check the math, but numbers don\u2019t lie, Penny. In any event, now that Amy and I have spent quality time together, I feel much more confident proceeding to the next stage of our relationship.\nPenny: And that is?\nSheldon: Using in vitro fertilization and a surrogate uterus to gift humanity with our progeny.\nPenny: You\u2019re still on that?\nSheldon: In these uncertain times, doesn\u2019t humanity deserve a gift?\nPenny: Okay, you know what? I\u2019m gonna come at this in a whole new way. Sheldon, if you try to make a baby with Amy in a petri dish, I\u2019m gonna tell your mother on you.\nSheldon: That\u2019s no threat. My mother\u2019s always wanted a grandchild.\nPenny: Really? Your deeply religious born-again Christian mother wants a test-tube grandbaby born out of wedlock?\nSheldon: Curses.\nPenny: If I\u2019d thought of that in the first place, I could\u2019ve saved myself this whole night.\nSheldon: Well, it\u2019s not that late. You could still go out and look for number 32. Good night.\nLeonard (on phone): Hey, Howard, what\u2019s up?\nSheldon: I\u2019ve decided not to procreate.\nLeonard: Yeah, yeah, great. Howard, uh, slow down. What do you mean it happened again?\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "8_6": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The apartment.\nBernadette: I like your suit.\nPenny: Oh, thanks. Got a couple new outfits for work.\nHoward: How does it feel knowing your fianc\u00e9e\u2019s job is to go out and flirt with doctors, looking like that, while you sit here, you know, looking like this?\nLeonard: She doesn\u2019t flirt with doctors.\nPenny: Yeah. It\u2019s all very professional.\nAmy: You know when you bend over, I can see down your shirt?\nPenny: Okay, good.\nBernadette: Speaking of new careers, how are things going with dark matter, Sheldon?\nSheldon: Oh, yeah, I\u2019d have to say it\u2019s the most exiting time in the history of the field.\nBernadette: Oh. What\u2019s going on?\nSheldon: I started doing it.\nRaj: You know, the government funded the biggest experiment yet to detect dark matter.\nLeonard: Yeah, I\u2019ve read about that, they\u2019re sending research teams down into abandoned salt mines.\nRaj: You know, Sheldon, if we apply to be one of those teams, we could be on the ground floor of something big, not just for theoretical physics but for astrophysics as well.\nPenny: Wait, hang on, you guys are gonna work in a mine?\nSheldon: Why not?\nPenny: You had a panic attack when we went through the car wash.\nSheldon: Perhaps the emotion you\u2019re referring to was shock at you having something cleaned.\nLeonard: I think what Penny meant is, the thought of you two in a mine is kind of funny, it\u2019s like a cat riding a Roomba.\nHoward:If they get scared, they\u2019ll have those hats with the lights on them, \u2019cause down there it\u2019s night-night all the time.\nBernadette: Maybe they could ride around in one of those mine carts that go ee-oo-ee-oo-ee-oo.\nLeonard: Yeah, it\u2019ll help them get away when they see a g-g-ghost.\nSheldon:Are they making fun of us?\nRaj: Yup.\nSheldon: I miss the old days when I couldn\u2019t tell.\nCredits sequence. \nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment.\nLeonard: So, one of my favourite video games of all time is called Shadow of the Colossus, and it was only for PlayStation 2, but then they came out with a new version for PS3 with better graphics. I finally got the chance to play it, and for some reason, it just wasn\u2019t as good as the first one. Or something about yoga.\nPenny: I\u2019m sorry, I was thinking about work.\nLeonard: Well, I was just saying that there was this video game\u2026\nPenny: Yeah, that\u2019s when I started thinking about work. Uh, listen, I\u2019ve got some good news.\nLeonard: Hmm.\nPenny: This is for you.\nLeonard: Huh. What is this?\nPenny: Well, you know how they gave me the company car? Didn\u2019t make sense to have two, so I sold the other one.\nLeonard: The one I gave you?\nPenny: Yeah. And there\u2019s your money back, and now we\u2019re even. How great is that?\nLeonard: Uh, yeah.\nPenny: What?\nLeonard: Nothing.\nPenny: Oh, come on, Leonard, I know the car was a thoughtful gesture and I really appreciate it, but it doesn\u2019t make sense to have both.\nLeonard: You\u2019re right.\nPenny: What should I have done? Taken a picture of us in the car and put it in a pink frame with puffy paint around it that says best fianc\u00e9 ever?\nLeonard: Doesn\u2019t sound that bad.\nPenny: Well, good, because that\u2019s what I did.\nLeonard: Aw, oh, thank you. That is so sweet.\nPenny: Well, it\u2019s not that sweet, I paid for the frame with your money and then got a massage.\nLeonard: You know what, you don\u2019t have to give me this. You keep it.\nPenny: Why?\nLeonard: The car was a gift, it was something you needed. I was happy to help you out.\nPenny: And I really appreciate it, but now I don\u2019t need it, so here you go.\nLeonard: Well, this is silly, so you don\u2019t need the car, but you could use it to buy yourself something else, like a new purse to put all this money in.\nPenny: Sweetie, I can buy my own stuff. I have a good job now.\nLeonard: I know, and I\u2019m proud of you, but that doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t do something nice. Like this.\nPenny: Okay, I don\u2019t want this to turn into a fight.\nLeonard: I don\u2019t, either.\nPenny: Great. Thank you. Can you pass the salt, please?\nLeonard: Sure. In my mind, that broke the tension with comedy and led to sex.\nScene: Sheldon\u2019s office.\nRaj: Hey, Sheldon, you busy?\nSheldon: I\u2019m always busy. This mind is capable of advanced multitasking. You know, currently, I\u2019m attempting to solve the Penrose conjecture, I\u2019m composing my Nobel acceptance speech for when I\u2019ve solved the Penrose conjecture, and I\u2019m wondering how mermaids have babies.\nRaj: Don\u2019t they lay eggs on a rock?\nSheldon: Now I\u2019ve got room for another thing. What do you want?\nRaj: So, I did a little research on what the conditions are like in the mines, and the guys might be right, sounds pretty rough down there. For starters, it\u2019s very humid, and about a hundred degrees.\nSheldon: Well, I\u2019m from Texas and you\u2019re from India, we\u2019re no strangers to the fragrant armpit. Next.\nRaj: It\u2019s also a live mine, so there\u2019ll be dynamite explosions going off in the distance.\nSheldon: Yeah, I have a lactose intolerant roommate with a taste for ice cream. Next.\nRaj: Oh, you have to be down there for 12 hours at a time.\nSheldon: Yeah? We have to be somewhere.\nRaj: Well, there\u2019s no toilets, we\u2019ll have to do our business in a bucket.\nSheldon: So it\u2019s settled, we\u2019re not doing it.\nRaj: Look, I get it, but before we pass up on an incredible opportunity, I was thinking about when Howard was training to go to space, they put him in a simulated environment.\nSheldon: Interesting. You\u2019re suggesting that we recreate the conditions of the mine to see if we can handle it.\nRaj: Exactly.\nSheldon: Very well.\nRaj: So where should we do it?\nSheldon: Well, I\u2019ll just Google hot, dark and moist, see what comes up.\nRaj: Uh, Sheldon\u2026\nSheldon: Oh, there, well, look, there\u2019s all kinds of videos.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment.\nLeonard: Hey, you got a sec?\nPenny: Hi. Sure.\nLeonard: I was hoping we could talk about the money again.\nPenny: Oh, sweetie, just forget about it.\nLeonard: No, no, no, no, hear me out. I know things got a little weird last night.\nPenny: Well, leaving an envelope full of cash on my dresser after sex would count as weird.\nLeonard: Well, I think I came up with a pretty good solution.\nPenny: Mm.\nLeonard: Why don\u2019t we just put the money in a joint account? It\u2019ll be our first money together. We can use it for the wedding, the honeymoon, whatever.\nPenny: You know what, that\u2019s great. I love that.\nLeonard: Yeah, of course you do, I\u2019m not just a genius in bed. You sure are, baby.\nPenny: You two want to be alone?\nLeonard: I want you to know I get why you don\u2019t want the money, you\u2019ve got this new job, you\u2019re excited about being financially independent, and I am nothing but proud of you.\nPenny: Oh, thank you so much. It feels so good to hear you say that. And I want you to know that I get this job kind of changes the balance in our relationship, and I\u2019m trying to be sensitive to that.\nLeonard: What?\nPenny: Well, I just think that maybe you\u2019re a little hung up on the money because I\u2019m less reliant on you now, and that\u2019s a little scary.\nLeonard: Hmm. Maybe. Or maybe I tried to do something nice and maybe you had a problem with it because of your control issues.\nPenny: Control issues?\nLeonard: Maybe.\nPenny: Or, maybe now that I\u2019m no longer an out-of-work actress who can\u2019t pay for her own dinner, that makes you a little insecure.\nLeonard: Well, I can\u2019t believe you\u2019d say that. You know how insecure I am about my insecurities.\nPenny: You know what? I\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s stupid to fight over money.\nLeonard: Yeah, I\u2019m sorry, too. We\u2019re about to share the rest of our lives together. It\u2019s our money, who cares who has it?\nPenny: Ugh, You\u2019re right, who cares? Mm. Get that money out of my back pocket or I will break your fingers.\nScene: The university basement.\nRaj: Huh. All this time I never knew there were steam tunnels down here.\nAmy: Most universities have them. When I was an undergrad, I spent three days in one pledging a sorority.\nRaj: Did you get in?\nAmy: No. They forgot I was there. But it really opened up my pores.\nSheldon: Well, according to my research, the steam tunnels below this access point should be the closest analog to the mines.\nRaj: This is gonna be so much more accurate than the steam room at the gym.\nSheldon: Plus, there\u2019s almost no chance we\u2019ll see any of our coworkers half naked.\nRaj: Or totally naked. I love Howard, but the dude needs a little shame.\nSheldon: All right, Amy, this walkie-talkie is yours. If we run into any problems, I\u2019ll contact you. And if anything bad happens, what\u2019s the rule?\nAmy: Save you first; come back for Raj only if there\u2019s time.\nRaj: We\u2019re going to be fine.\nAmy: Sheldon, I\u2019m really impressed you\u2019re willing to try this.\nSheldon: Well, admittedly, this brushes up against my well-known aversions to heat, small places, going below floor-level, dampness, hatches, ladders, darkness, echoes, and eliminating in Home Depot buckets. That last one is quite new, but I have a feeling that\u2019s gonna rocket to the top of the list.\nRaj: I\u2019m sweating already.\nSheldon: Yeah, as the person beneath you, allow me to say, I know.\nRaj: How hot is it?\nSheldon: Uh, let\u2019s see. 704? No, wait, it\u2019s on clock. Uh, the real answer isn\u2019t much better. 102 degrees.\nRaj: Well, that\u2019s what we wanted. This is as hot as the mines will be.\nSheldon: True. Sheldon\u2019s Mine Simulation Log, entry one. Koothrappali\u2019s restating of the obvious is already getting on my nerves.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s apartment.\nLeonard: Thanks again for having us.\nHoward: Oh, of course. What did you guys want to talk about?\nPenny: Well, you know, now that we\u2019re engaged, we had some questions about how you handle money as a couple.\nBernadette: I told you they weren\u2019t gonna ask us to swing with them.\nHoward: I didn\u2019t think they were going to. I just wanted to have a way to say no without hurting Leonard\u2019s feelings.\nLeonard: Well, nailed it.\nHoward: So what did you want to know?\nPenny: Well, do you guys ever fight over money?\nBernadette: Sure, sometimes. I mean, it can be a little awkward since I make so much more money than Howie.\nHoward: You didn\u2019t have to say so much more.\nBernadette: Well, I didn\u2019t have to, but for the sake of accuracy I felt that I should.\nHoward: I brought a lot of significant assets into the relationship, too.\nBernadette: Like what? Your incomplete set of Star Trek collector plates?\nHoward: For your information, I just bought the last one I needed on eBay.\nBernadette: Without asking me?\nHoward: There were only three minutes left in the auction and it was a mint condition Scotty from a smoke-free home.\nBernadette: How much, Howie?\nHoward: Not a lot.\nBernadette: How much?\nHoward: Let\u2019s not talk about this in front of our friends.\nBernadette: Was it more or less than falconry school?\nHoward: For the tenth time, that was a Groupon.\nLeonard: Like I would swing with him.\nScene: The steam tunnel. \nRaj: How you feeling?\nSheldon: Good. Little claustrophobic.\nRaj: Let\u2019s set up the equipment. It\u2019ll help take your mind off of it.\nSheldon: Miners often sang mining songs to keep their spirits up.\nRaj: Do you know any mining songs?\nSheldon: Just the hits. (Singing) Where it\u2019s dark as a dungeon, and it\u2019s damp as the dew.\nRajj: That\u2019s pretty.\nSheldon: Where the dangers are double, and the pleasures are few. Where the rain never falls and the sun never shines, yes, it\u2019s dark as a dungeon way down in the mine.\nRaj: It\u2019s a little more bleak than I thought.\nSheldon: Well, I pray when I\u2019m dead and the ages shall roll, that my body will blacken and turn into coal.\nRaj: Getting kind of grim.\nSheldon: Then I\u2019ll look from the door of my heavenly home, and pity the miner that mines my poor bones.\nRaj: Okay. How \u2019bout a little Miley Cyrus next?\nSheldon: Who\u2019s he?\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s apartment.\nHoward: Talk about wasted money. What about the late fees on our credit card because somebody didn\u2019t pay the bill on time?\nBernadette: Well, maybe I would have paid it if I wasn\u2019t also doing everything else around here.\nHoward: Oh, you\u2019re saying I don\u2019t do anything around here. Look at my chore chart.\nLeonard: She made him a chore chart.\nPenny: I see it.\nHoward: Do the dishes. There\u2019s a star right there.\nBernadette: That was a pity star. Putting water in the roasting pan and leaving it in the sink is not doing the dishes.\nHoward: That pan had to soak and you know it.\nBernadette: Well, don\u2019t come crying to me when you don\u2019t get your allowance.\nHoward: It\u2019s not an allowance. It\u2019s a stipend, and we said we weren\u2019t gonna call it an allowance in front of my friends.\nLeonard: I usually don\u2019t like lemon bars, but these, these are really good.\nScene: The steam tunnel. \nRaj: So, as Hannah Montana, Miley was a world-famous pop star. But then she would take off her wig and go to school like a normal girl. Which, I don\u2019t have to tell you, at that age, is its own headache.\nSheldon: That\u2019s preposterous. How would she go unrecognized just by wearing a wig?\nRaj: But you\u2019re okay with Superman concealing his identity with a pair of glasses?\nSheldon: He doesn\u2019t just put on a pair of glasses. He combs back his curlicue and affects a mild-mannered personality.\nAmy (shouting): You guys doing okay down there?\nSheldon: I told you to use the walkie-talkie!\nAmy (on walkie-talkie): You guys doing okay down there?\nSheldon: Please keep this channel clear for emergencies. Thank you.\nAmy: I\u2019m going to the vending machine. Do you want anything?\nSheldon: This is a simulation. We have to survive on the supplies we brought.\nAmy: Okay, just checking.\nRaj: We should have asked her to get some Funyuns.\nSheldon: You\u2019re not going to have Funyuns when we\u2019re a mile below the surface of the Earth.\nRaj: What if we brought them down with us?\nSheldon: We\u2019ll take some Funyuns.\nAmy: Anything else?\nSheldon: Some York Peppermint Patties, a couple of Dr. Peppers, and run to Best Buy and see if they have a portable DVD player and season one of a show called Hannah Montana.\nRajj: Have her get season two. Season one, it was still finding itself.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s apartment. \nBernadette: Sorry you guys had to see that.\nPenny: Oh, don\u2019t apologize.\nLeonard: Yeah. It just makes it a lot harder to pretend it never happened.\nBernadette: Money\u2019s a sensitive subject for Howie because of the difference in our income.\nPenny: It really bothers him?\nBernadette: Well, sure. There\u2019s still a lot of pressure on guys to be providers. So even though he\u2019s happy for me, it\u2019s just a little tough on him.\nPenny: Uh-oh.\nLeonard: What?\nPenny: Well, if I do well in sales, I could end up making a lot more money than you.\nLeonard: Not a problem. I grew up with a mother who emasculated my father financially and in every other aspect of his life, so really, it\u2019s what I think love looks like.\nBernadette: I\u2019ll be right back. I\u2019m gonna go check on him.\nPenny: Maybe it\u2019s a good thing we came here. It\u2019s like a lesson in what not to do.\nLeonard: Yeah I don\u2019t want something dumb like money to come between us.\nPenny: It won\u2019t. Let\u2019s just promise to figure this kind of stuff out before we get married.\nHoward (off): Why are you being so bossy?\nBernadette (off): Why are you being a baby?\nHoward (off): I\u2019m not a baby. I\u2019m a grown man, and I made the bed. Now where\u2019s my star?\nLeonard: Should we go?\nPenny: Hang on. I want to see if he gets the star.\nScene: The steam tunnel. \nRaj: Oh, this heat is brutal.\nSheldon: As someone from the tropical subcontinent of India, you should know that fanning yourself in a humid environment only raises your body temperature.\nRajj: Huh. That does explain why the servants used to look so hot while they were fanning me. Let\u2019s get our minds off how uncomfortable we are. We could take some more simulated instrument readings.\nSheldon: My major focus at the moment is keeping my claustrophobia at bay.\nRaj: How\u2019s that going?\nSheldon: You tell me. I feel like I can\u2019t breathe, and I am tempted to crack you open and suck the air right out of your lungs.\nRaj: Sheldon, if this is too much, we can stop.\nSheldon: We\u2019re not stopping.\nRaj: You don\u2019t have to bite my head off.\nSheldon: I apologize. I just, I\u2019m plagued by an internal struggle.\nRaj: If you would just use the bucket, you\u2019d be so much more comfortable.\nSheldon: My struggle is emotional.\nRaj: Oh. Is it Amy?\nSheldon: It\u2019s dark matter. When I entered the field of string theory, I was a prodigy. I rose to a position of respect, and I assumed my career would continue on that upward trajectory. Now here I am in my 30s, I\u2019m back at square one. And, frankly, it\u2019s frightening.\nRaj: Sheldon, you know what I think of when I\u2019m scared? Voyager.\nSheldon: Voyager the space probe or Voyager the Star Trek TV show?\nRaj: The space probe.\nSheldon: Good. Because I am too hot and tired to go on about how much I hate Voyager the TV show.\nRaj: By the time I was born, Voyager 1\u2019s mission was supposed to be over. It had seen Jupiter and Saturn and all their moons, but it kept going. When I left India for America, I was never more scared in my life. I had no idea what lay ahead. Whenever I feel that way, I think about how Voyager is still out there somewhere beyond our solar system, going further than anyone ever thought it could. Don\u2019t leave. You can do this.\nAmy: Sheldon, is everything okay?\nSheldon: It\u2019s too late for Koothrappali. Let\u2019s go.\nAmy: 11 minutes. That\u2019s longer than I thought.\nRaj (off): They\u2019re in my shirt. They\u2019re in my shirt. They\u2019re in my shirt.\nScene: Penny\u2019s bedroom.\nPenny: Okay, this is definitely the most fun thing we can do with the money.\nLeonard: I\u2019ve never done it on a big old pile of cash before. Me neither, Leonard. It\u2019s my first time, too.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s bedroom.\nBernadette: I\u2019m so sorry I made you feel bad about the money stuff.\nHoward: It\u2019s okay.\nBernadette: No, it\u2019s not okay. I want us to be partners, equals. Adults in a mature relationship.\nHoward: I want that, too.\nBernadette: Now, let\u2019s talk about your birthday party.\nHoward: Ooh, laser tag, laser tag.\nBernadette: Oh.\nScene: The apartment. \nAmy: Do you really need me to transcribe this?\nSheldon: You\u2019re not doing it for me. You\u2019re doing it for future generations who will benefit from my struggle. (Voice on recorder) Sheldon\u2019s Mine Simulation Log, entry four. My Kit Kat has melted. All is lost.\nRaj: You call yourself a friend? I was trying to help you, and at the first sign of trouble you ran away, leaving me to fend off a family of rats. You\u2019re a completely selfish human being and a, and a physical and a moral coward.\nSheldon: His statements of the obvious continue to annoy.\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "6_7": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Hello, I\u2019m Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

Now this week we have a very special episode where we explore the flags of the popular entertainment franchise, Star Trek. And to help me, I\u2019m pleased to introduce Internet personality, former star of Star Trek: The Next Generation, and the only guy I know lucky enough to be immortalized in one sixteenth scale. Set phasers to fun for my friend, Wil Wheaton.\nWil: Hi, Sheldon. Thanks for having me. I\u2019m happy to be here.\nAmy: Cut.\nSheldon: What\u2019s wrong?\nAmy: Sorry, Sheldon, you were brilliant as always. Wil, that was a little wooden.\nWil: Wooden?\nAmy: Don\u2019t worry, it wasn\u2019t terrible. Just, this time, try to say it the way people sound. And action.\nSheldon: My friend, Wil Wheaton.\nWil: Hi, Sheldon. Thanks for having me. I\u2019m excited to be here.\nSheldon: So, Wil, what do you have for us first?\nWil: Well, this is an exciting one. This is the flag of the United Federation of Planets. Now what\u2019s interesting about this flag\u2026\nAmy: Cut.\nWil: What was wrong with that?\nAmy: It\u2019s called Fun with Flags. They\u2019re not at half-mast, nobody died. Let\u2019s try and keep it upbeat.\nWil: Um, no offence, but I\u2019ve been acting since I was a kid. I think I can handle a Web show without a lot of direction.\nSheldon: It\u2019s true. In 1982, Wil played the voice of Martin the mouse in The Secret of NIMH. You moved me.\nAmy: You\u2019ll have to forgive me. This is my first time directing, I just want it to be good.\nWil: So do I.\nAmy: Great. So, this time let\u2019s try more real boy, less Pinocchio. And action.\nWil: And cut. You realize that I\u2019m doing this for free, right?\nAmy: Yes. And so far, we\u2019re still not getting our money\u2019s worth. Let\u2019s try it again. Everybody\u2019s having fun. And action.\nSheldon: So, Wil, what do you have for us first?\nWil: Well, this is an exciting one. This is the flag of the United Federation of Planets.\nAmy: Cut.\nWil: Problem, first-time director?\nSheldon: Oh, none that I could see. I saw a man who loved flags almost as much as I do. I got goose bumps.\nAmy: He was overacting on purpose.\nSheldon: Really? He reminded me of a young William Shatner.\nWil: Listen, Sheldon, I\u2019m really happy to do this for you, but not if she\u2019s gonna be a huge pain in the ass the whole time.\nAmy: You gonna let him speak to me like that?\nSheldon: Well, you\u2019re my girlfriend and I don\u2019t want you to be upset. Then again, Wil Wheaton\u2019s my friend and I don\u2019t want him to be upset. Hmm, this is a sticky wicket. (To Wil) What do you think?\nAmy: Can I speak to you for a second?\nSheldon: I\u2019ll be right back. Feel free to play with yourself.\nAmy: I don\u2019t care for your friend, he\u2019s being rude to me. You need to ask him to leave.\nSheldon: Amy, I can\u2019t just ask Wil Wheaton to leave. He\u2019s a minor celebrity. Once you explain who he is, many people recognize him.\nAmy: Fine. Then maybe I should go.\nSheldon: Could you? That would solve everything. You are the best. I\u2019ll see you at dinner tonight?\nAmy: You sure you wouldn\u2019t rather have dinner with your friend Wil Wheaton?\nSheldon: Come to think of it, I would! You, little lady, are on fire.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: Howard\u2019s bedroom.\nBernadette: Every time we eat dinner here, your mother refuses to let me help with the dishes.\nHoward: Don\u2019t take it personally. She likes doing them by herself so she can lick the plates with no one looking.\nBernadette: You ready to go?\nHoward: Yeah, let me just grab a couple of fresh turtlenecks.\nBernadette: I don\u2019t understand why you keep your stuff here when there\u2019s plenty of room at home.\nHoward: What are you talking about? All I have here is a few sweaters, books, bank stuff, computers, mail, collectibles, medicine and my electric body groomer. Ooh, there\u2019s my plaid dickie. Oh, got this at the Goodwill store for 50 cents. Can you believe it?\nBernadette: 50 cents sounds right. Let\u2019s go.\nHoward: You know, it\u2019s kinda late. Why don\u2019t we just spend the night here?\nBernadette: Because we don\u2019t live here.\nHoward: I know.\nBernadette: Do you? You said when you got back from space you were gonna move into my apartment, but half the time we stay here.\nHoward: That\u2019s not true.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Howard, I\u2019m doing laundry. You want me to put anything in for you?\nHoward: There\u2019s some underwear in the hamper.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Oh, good, I got that new stain stick to try out.\nHoward: Thank you, I only put it on the list two weeks ago. Okay, I see what you\u2019re getting at. How about this weekend I\u2019ll box up all my things and move them to our place.\nBernadette: Thank you.\nHoward: The lightsabres are gonna look great in the living room.\nBernadette: Or in the closet. We can decide later.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Howard, help, my hand\u2019s stuck in the garbage disposal.\nHoward: Let go of whatever piece of food you\u2019re holding.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Are you kidding? It\u2019s a perfectly good chicken leg.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: Hey, look who\u2019s out after dark, like a big boy.\nSheldon: I was out raising heck with Mr. Wil Wheaton. Four hours more and we would have closed down the HomeTown Buffet.\nLeonard: I thought you had plans with Amy.\nSheldon: Yeah, I did, but then Wil called Amy a pain in the A-S-S. She got huffy and left, then Wil and I headed out to dinner. That place really did remind me of my hometown. Because there we also have a HomeTown Buffet.\nLeonard: Hold on. Wil and Amy had an argument?\nSheldon: Yes, quite the kerfuffle.\nLeonard: Then Amy got mad and left?\nSheldon: Walked right out the door.\nLeonard: And you?\nSheldon: Enjoyed a delightful dinner at a reasonable price. The manager recognized Wil and let us sit right next to the frozen yoghurt machine. Right next to it. I was closer to it than I am to you right now.\nLeonard: Buddy, I think Amy might be upset.\nSheldon: Why\u2019s that?\nLeonard: Because your friend was rude to her, and then you went to dinner with him.\nSheldon: You\u2019re just repeating what I said. It\u2019s like living with a lactose-intolerant parrot.\nLeonard: Trust me, call her.\nSheldon: Fine. It\u2019s a shame you didn\u2019t go to dinner with us, because the buffet you\u2019re about to enjoy only serves humble pie, a dessert much less tasty than frozen yoghurt. I was this close.\nAmy (on skype): What?\nSheldon: You\u2019ll appreciate this. Leonard has some ridiculous notion that you\u2019re mad at me. Tell him you\u2019re not mad at me. Go ahead, set him straight.\nAmy: I\u2019m mad at you, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Hmm. Eat one of your Luna bars. Very often when women think they\u2019re angry, they\u2019re really just hungry.\nAmy: I\u2019m not hungry. Your friend insulted me, and you didn\u2019t do anything.\nSheldon: Precisely, I didn\u2019t do anything. Now does someone feel like checking her emotional math?\nLeonard: Keep going, buddy, you\u2019re doing great.\nAmy: Sheldon, I\u2019m your girlfriend, and you should have taken my side. That\u2019s it. End of story. Good night.\nSheldon: Wow, Amy\u2019s mad and Leonard was right. What a weird day.\nScene: The Cheesecake Factory.\nPenny: Hey. Sorry this took so long. But you used to work here, you know how it is.\nBernadette: Kitchen slammed again?\nPenny: No, I\u2019m a terrible waitress, remember?\nBernadette: So, is there anything I can do to help you with the move tomorrow?\nHoward: Now that you mention it, I was thinking tomorrow might not be great.\nBernadette: What\u2019s your excuse this time?\nHoward: No excuse. It\u2019s just, you know, I\u2019m Jewish, and technically, we\u2019re not supposed to drive or carry anything on the Sabbath. So this one\u2019s on God.\nBernadette: That might be a little more convincing if you didn\u2019t have a mouthful of bacon cheeseburger.\nHoward: My religion\u2019s kinda loosey-goosey. Basically, as long as you got your schmekel clipped and don\u2019t wear a cross, you\u2019re good.\nBernadette: Howie, you promised you\u2019d move.\nHoward: And I will.\nPenny: Yeah, right.\nHoward: I will. I\u2019m obviously not going to live in my mother\u2019s house for the rest of my life. I\u2019m not a child.\nPenny: I\u2019ve seen her burp you.\nHoward: She did not burp me. She was patting me on the back, and I happened to burp. Don\u2019t you have other tables you should be waiting on?\nPenny: Yeah, but I told you, I\u2019m not good at my job. Bernadette, listen to me. He is never gonna leave.\nBernadette: I\u2019m starting to think you\u2019re right.\nHoward: All right, I\u2019ve had enough of this. I\u2019m a grown man, I have a successful career, for the love of God, I\u2019ve been to space. I will move out when I\u2019m ready, and I don\u2019t need anyone badgering me into it.\nPenny: Wow, excuse me.\nHoward: That was just for her benefit. I\u2019ll move tomorrow. I love you. Don\u2019t leave me.\nScene: Amy\u2019s apartment.\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Angry Amy.\nAmy: What?\nSheldon: I\u2019ve been thinking about what happened, and I hope this gift will make things better.\nAmy: Star Trek DVDs? Why would I want this?\nSheldon: First of all, you\u2019re welcome. And furthermore, not being familiar with Wil Wheaton\u2019s body of work, there was no way for you to know you were being rude to a national treasure. Get ready for 130 hours of I told you so. (She hands him back the DVDs and slams the door) Fine. I\u2019ll just tell you what happens. Episode one, Encounter at Farpoint. Fade in. The new Enterprise heads out on its maiden voyage to contact the Bandi people of Deneb IV. Enter Wesley Crusher, played by my buddy\u2026 (Amy opens door, grabs DVDs, slams door again) She\u2019s hooked.\nScene: Howard\u2019s bedroom.\nRaj: Wow. An end of an era.\nHoward: Boy, if these walls could talk.\nLeonard: They\u2019d say, why does he touch himself so much?\nHoward: Yeah. I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m not going to live here anymore. This has always been my bedroom. Right here is where my mom used to mark my height.\nLeonard: Oh, yeah. Fifth grade. Sixth grade. Seventh grade. Eighth grade. Ninth grade.\nHoward: I remember when I was five, hiding under this desk with all my Halloween candy. Had some Peanut M&M\u2019S, went into my first anaphylactic shock and had to be rushed to the hospital. Came home, celebrated with a Snickers, went into my second anaphylactic shock.\nRaj: When did you figure out you were allergic to nuts?\nHoward: Sometime around the third Almond Joy.\nLeonard: Okay. You want to start loading this stuff into the truck?\nHoward: Yeah, I guess. Hey, would you do me a favour? Go on ahead. I just want one last moment alone in my old room.\nLeonard: We\u2019re not standing outside by the U-Haul while you fondle yourself.\nHoward: Fine, let\u2019s go.\nScene: The Cheesecake Factory Bar.\nPenny: Hey. What brings you in?\nSheldon: Penny, if you wouldn\u2019t mind, I\u2019d like to have a conversation about girls.\nPenny: I had a feeling we\u2019d have a talk like this sooner or later. Are you finally getting fuzz in weird places?\nSheldon: Penny, please, I\u2019m on the horns of a relationship dilemma. And for the record, I had a full pubis of hair by the time I was 19.\nPenny: And for the record, bleugh. So what are you drinking?\nSheldon: Well, it\u2019s been a rough day. I usually go chamomile tea, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to cut it.\nPenny: You could have a Long Island Iced Tea.\nSheldon: Will that calm my nerves?\nPenny: It\u2019s calmed the pants off me a couple of times.\nSheldon: Sold.\nPenny: Oh. So, the heart you got from the wizard giving you trouble?\nSheldon: The trouble isn\u2019t with me, Penny, it\u2019s with your gender. Someday, scientists will discover that second X chromosome contains nothing but nonsense and twaddle.\nPenny: Yeah, Amy told me what happened. Look, just apologize. It\u2019ll warm her twaddle.\nSheldon: It\u2019s a Band-Aid at best. See, the core problem is that Amy and Wil do not like each other. Which is baffling because they\u2019re both crazy about me. And I like them, which indicates they\u2019re bright and interesting and/or were on Star Trek.\nPenny: Honey, you can\u2019t make people like each other.\nSheldon: Not true. Leonard made me like you. And let me tell you, that was a hard row to hoe. Cheers, pal. Ooh. Boy, that is a treat that\u2019s hard to beat. Get the Mad Hatter on the horn, I\u2019m having a tea party.\nPenny: You might want to pace yourself.\nSheldon: I drink tea all the time. I think I know what I\u2019m doing.\nPenny: Far be it from me to criticize a man with a full pubis. Look, Sheldon, your problem is not Wil Wheaton, okay? Your problem is the way you treated Amy.\nSheldon: My problem is I\u2019m out of tea.\nPenny: Come on, someone insulted your girlfriend and you just let him do it. I thought you Texas guys stood up for your womenfolk.\nSheldon: Penny, please, I think I\u2019ve evolved beyond my simple rustic upbringing.\nPenny: Sorry.\nSheldon: On the other hand, that low-down polecat done wronged my woman.\nPenny: Welcome to Long Island, Tex.\nSheldon: Amy deserves better. You know, when we buy the Planter\u2019s deluxe mix, she eats all the Brazil nuts so I don\u2019t have to look at them. She\u2019s a unique blend of saint and squirrel.\nPenny: Yeah, that she is. Here you go.\nSheldon: I\u2019m a callous egomaniac. She\u2019s gonna leave me.\nPenny: No, she won\u2019t.\nSheldon: No, she won\u2019t. I\u2019m great.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s apartment.\nHoward: Okay, I have now officially moved out of my mother\u2019s house. You are now the only woman in my life who I\u2019ll see naked in the bathroom.\nBernadette: I know this wasn\u2019t easy. You doing okay?\nHoward: Oh, I\u2019m fine. It\u2019s just her I\u2019m worried about.\nBernadette: Aw, she\u2019ll be okay. She\u2019s a grown woman.\nHoward: I know. It\u2019s just ever since my dad left, I\u2019ve felt responsible for her.\nBernadette: That\u2019s a lot for a kid to deal with.\nHoward: She was just so sad all the time. I was the only person who could cheer her up. Well, me and Ben and Jerry.\nBernadette: She\u2019s lucky you were there.\nHoward: You know, she\u2019s why I first got into magic. I would do little shows for her, hang up a bedsheet like it was a curtain, put on a top hat and cape. And part way through the act, I would say I needed a volunteer from the audience to be my beautiful assistant and invite her up on stage. I can still remember the way she\u2019d smile. For a few minutes, she\u2019d forget how lonely she was.\nBernadette: Aw, crap. Let\u2019s go.\nHoward: Where we going?\nBernadette: Grab a box. We\u2019ll sleep at your mother\u2019s place tonight.\nHoward: No, but I want to live here.\nBernadette: Well, you should\u2019ve thought of that before you told me the stupid magic trick story.\nHoward: Can\u2019t we talk about this?\nBernadette: No husband of mine is gonna break his mother\u2019s heart!\nScene: Wil Wheaton\u2019s house.\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Wil Wheaton! (Knock, knock, knock) Wil Wheaton! Wait, how many was that?\nWil: Hey, Sheldon, what\u2019s up?\nSheldon: Wouldn\u2019t you like to know?\nWil: Have you been drinking?\nSheldon: Just tea. S\u2019the best tea I\u2019ve ever had.\nWil: Why are you here?\nSheldon: I\u2019ll tell you. I\u2019m from Texas. Need I say more?\nWil: Yeah, actually, a little more would be helpful.\nSheldon: You insulted my woman. I\u2019m here to defend her honour. Two! It was two. (Knock, knock, knock) Wil Wheaton! Now prepare yourself for what may come.\nWil: Oh, Sheldon, do you really think we\u2019re gonna fight?\nSheldon: My fists are not up here because I\u2019m milking a giant invisible cow. They\u2019re up to beat an apology out of you.\nWil: Okay, I\u2019m sorry.\nSheldon: Well, that was a long bus ride for not very much.\nWil: Are you okay?\nSheldon: You\u2019re asking a lot of questions, Wil Wheaton. As a matter of idle curiosity, which of your shrubberies do you feel would benefit from a thorough vomiting? Never mind, I\u2019ll choose. (Vomits) You were so good in Stand by Me.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Hello, I\u2019m Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Welcome to Sheldon Cooper Presents Fun with Flags. Get ready for a very special episode where we explore the flags of the popular entertainment franchise, Star Trek. And to help us, I\u2019m pleased to introduce a special guest, surprisingly, it only took gas money and the promise of free food to get him here, Mr. LeVar Burton.\nLeVar: Hey, Sheldon, it\u2019s a pleasure to be here. Well, we\u2019ve got some interesting flags for\u2026\nAmy: Cut. Yikes, this guy is worse than Wil Wheaton.\nSheldon: I don\u2019t know what she\u2019s talking about, but I\u2019m obligated to agree with her. She\u2019s my girlfriend.\nLeVar: Ah, I hear you, brother. I still get lunch, right?\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "5_6": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The apartment. Sheldon\u2019s mother is visiting.\nLeonard: So what kind of cruise is this you\u2019re going on?\nMrs Cooper: It\u2019s called the Born Again Boat Ride. Christian Quarterly gave it their highest rating, five thorny crowns. I do wish you\u2019d come with me, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Well, Mom, if I did, it would be conclusive proof that your God can work miracles.\nMrs Cooper: You\u2019re missing out. It\u2019s gonna be wall-to-wall fun. It\u2019s all themed. There\u2019s Jonah and the Whale Watching, all-you-can-eat Last Supper Buffet, and my personal favourite, Gunning with God.\nLeonard: What\u2019s Gunning with God? I\u2019m afraid to ask.\nMrs Cooper: Oh, it is a hoot and a half. You write your sins on a clay pigeon, they fire \u2019em up in the air, and you pulverize them with a 12-gauge shotgun full of our Lord\u2019s forgiveness.\nSheldon: Frankly, Mom, I\u2019m encouraged to see how advanced your group has become, willing to sail out into the ocean without fear of falling off the edge.\nMrs Cooper: For example, if Shelly was aboard, he\u2019d write \u201csmart mouth\u201d on his pigeon, and then bam!\nSheldon: The Lord giveth and the Lord bloweth away. Well, Mom, according to my itinerary for our weekend together, the fun begins with fried chicken.\nMrs Cooper: Sounds delicious.\nSheldon: Good, \u2019cause I got you everything you need to make it. You are in for a treat. My mother\u2019s fried chicken is why we had to buy my dad the extra large coffin.\nLeonard: Sheldon, she just got off the plane. She doesn\u2019t want to cook.\nSheldon: Of course she does. Making me food is her way of saying I love you. Making me food when she\u2019s too tired to cook is her way of saying I really love you.\nMrs Cooper: Actually, I wouldn\u2019t mind going out for a bite, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Won\u2019t that spoil our appetites for the chicken you\u2019re going to make me?\nLeonard: All right, that settles it, we\u2019re going out. Do you like sushi? There\u2019s a great little place down the street.\nMrs Cooper: I\u2019ve never had it, but there\u2019s no harm in trying something new.\nSheldon: There\u2019s a lot of harm in trying something new. That\u2019s why we test out drugs and cosmetics on bunny rabbits.\nLeonard: Sheldon, you\u2019re talking like a crazy person.\nMrs Cooper: Actually, I had him tested as a child. Doctor says he\u2019s fine.\nSheldon: Told you.\nMrs Cooper: Although, I do regret not following up with that specialist in Houston.\nCredits Sequence.\nScene: A sushi bar.\nAll: Irasshaimase!\nSheldon: Stop yelling! I\u2019m not happy about this.\nLeonard: What\u2019s the last thing you were ever happy about?\nSheldon: The prospect of fried chicken.\nMrs Cooper: This is exciting. Back home, the diner on Route Four serves sushi, but it\u2019s just cut up fish sticks and a side of Uncle Ben\u2019s. They put it on the menu in those kung fu letters, but that don\u2019t make it sushi.\nLeonard: Uh, kung fu letters might not be politically correct.\nMrs Cooper: Oh, I thought the one we couldn\u2019t say was ching chong.\nLeonard: Yeah, yeah, that, too.\nMrs Cooper: So, Shelly, what\u2019s up with you and your friend Amy, if you don\u2019t mind a mother prying a bit?\nSheldon: Well, there\u2019s actually big news on the Amy front. She\u2019s been studying the neurobiology of addiction in lower animals. She is this close to getting a starfish hooked on cocaine.\nMrs Cooper: Do you have any idea what\u2019s going on with those two?\nLeonard: It\u2019s kind of like the Loch Ness monster. Maybe there\u2019s something there, maybe there isn\u2019t. We\u2019ll probably never know. But sometimes it\u2019s fun to creep yourself out thinking about it.\nMrs Cooper: How are you doing on the young lady front? I hear you\u2019re in some sort of a long distance situation?\nLeonard: Uh, yeah, it\u2019s Raj\u2019s sister. It\u2019s kind of tough. She\u2019s in India. Also, her parents aren\u2019t happy she\u2019s dating someone white.\nMrs Cooper: Oh, that\u2019s a funny turn, isn\u2019t it? You never think about it going the other way. Well, you can\u2019t force things. You need to figure out if you\u2019re in a relationship or if you\u2019re just calling it one. It\u2019s like they say, a cat can have kittens in the oven but that don\u2019t make \u2019em biscuits.\nSheldon: And that reminds me of another saying. You can lead a chicken to Crisco, but you can\u2019tmake your mother fry it.\nMrs Cooper: Sheldon, you pester me one more time about chicken, I will put you over my knee right here in this restaurant.\nLeonard: Please pester her. Please, for me.\nScene: The stairwell.\nLeonard: So, Mrs. Cooper, what did you think of the sushi?\nMrs Cooper: It was good. The only thing that would have made it better is if it was cooked and if it was beef. Sheldon, when is your landlord going to fix the elevator?\nSheldon: I don\u2019t know. Lately we\u2019ve been talking about converting it into a missile silo.\nLeonard: Your son seems to think we need to launch a pre-emptive strike on Burbank.\nSheldon: Get them before they get us.\nRaj (Sitting against their front door, drinking a beer): Hey, look who decided to show up.\nLeonard: Raj, what are you doing?\nRaj: I couldn\u2019t find you guys so I bought six new friends. Three, sadly, are dead.\nSheldon: Mom, you remember Rajesh? Rajesh, my mother.\nRaj: Of course. Mrs. Cooper. So nice to see you again.\nMrs Cooper: Well, it\u2019s so nice to see you, too. I thought it was our Indians that had the occasional alcohol problem.\nLeonard: We don\u2019t say that, either. I\u2019ll make you a list.\nMrs Cooper: Oh, that would be mighty white of you. So, Raj, what pain are you trying to cover up with alcohol?\nRaj: Nothing, I\u2019m fine.\nMrs Cooper: Are ya?\nRaj: No. (Bursts into tears)\nMrs Cooper: That\u2019s better. Now tell me what\u2019s bothering you.\nRaj: I\u2019m so lonely.\nSheldon: Oh, yes, born alone, die alone. It\u2019s a tragic human condition. Now, Raj, if you\u2019ll excuse my mother, she\u2019s about to make a pecan pie that\u2019ll be so good I\u2019ll almost forget how she blew it with the fried chicken.\nMrs Cooper: Sheldon, your friend is hurtin\u2019. What do we do when someone\u2019s hurtin\u2019?\nSheldon: Offer them a hot beverage.\nMrs Cooper: And when they\u2019re drunk as a skunk, what beverage do we offer?\nSheldon: Coffee.\nMrs Cooper: And what do we do it with? (Sheldon fixes a large false smile.) Now you listen to me. I know you feel like you can\u2019t find someone, but there\u2019s a lock for every key. Back home, there\u2019s a girl works at the Wal-Mart. Tall, tall girl. Woman could hunt geese with a rake. Thought she\u2019d never find a man, then one day, wouldn\u2019t ya know, Harlem Globetrotters come to town. Long story short, today that woman travels the world with a semi-professional basketball player and two beautiful mixed-race babies.\nRaj: I didn\u2019t get a lot of that because of your accent, but the general tone was soothing and somehow I feel better.\nSheldon: I\u2019m not going to get my pecan pie, am I?\nLeonard: You want some Oreos?\nSheldon: Double Stuf?\nLeonard: No, regular.\nSheldon: Nice. Kick a man when he\u2019s down.\nScene: The laundry room.\nSheldon: I\u2019m glad we\u2019re finally getting to do something together, just the two of us.\nMrs Cooper: Sure. One thing you really miss when you\u2019re on vacation is laundry.\nSheldon: Careful, you\u2019re using too much Downey. You know if my clothes get too soft it makes me sleepy.\nMrs Cooper: Well, this takes me back. Me doing your laundry, you next to me criticizing.\nSheldon: It is nice, isn\u2019t it?\nPenny (arriving): Mrs. Cooper. Hi!\nMrs Cooper: Oh, hello, darlin\u2019.\nPenny: Sheldon, you didn\u2019t tell me your mom was coming.\nSheldon: It was in my weekly e-mail blast. Right between beet season is finally here, and uh-oh, red stool from beets leads to cancer scare.\nMrs Cooper: So, how\u2019ve you been?\nPenny: Good, good.\nMrs Cooper: I hear that Leonard has a new girlfriend. How are you doing with all that?\nPenny: Oh, fine. You know, it\u2019s been a while. I\u2019m getting back out there.\nMrs Cooper: Let me ask you, when you get back out there, are you wearing this? (Holds up a skimpy top)\nPenny: Well, it\u2019s super cute on. That top has paid for itself in free drinks like ten times what it cost.\nSheldon: Yes, Penny has a lot of her money tied up in promiscuity futures.\nMrs Cooper: Hon, you think maybe the reason why you\u2019re having trouble finding a guy to settle down with is because you\u2019re letting them ride the roller coaster without buying a ticket?\nPenny: Oh, they don\u2019t always get to ride the roller coaster. Sometimes they only get to spin the teacups. Now I\u2019m going out tonight. Would it be crazy to ask you to look at the outfit I\u2019m going to wear?\nMrs Cooper: Oh, not crazy at all. And don\u2019t beat yourself up. When I was your age, you could have me for a car ride and a bottle of strawberry wine.\nSheldon: Now that will not be in this week\u2019s e-mail blast.\nScene: The apartment.\nHoward: So, this spring, I get to go to the International Space Station.\nMrs Cooper: Oh, my word, a trip to the heavens. If you ever want to live there eternally, I\u2019ve got a good book you could read.\nHoward: Thanks, but I watch the Charlie Brown Christmas special every year, so I get the gist.\nMrs Cooper: I bet your mom is really proud of you.\nHoward: Nope. She says if I don\u2019t back out she\u2019s going to go on a hunger strike. It would take years before she\u2019d be in any kind of danger, but still.\nSheldon: I\u2019ve got a treat for us tomorrow, Mom. I\u2019m taking you to see Saul Perlmutter give a lecture about his Nobel Prize-winning work in cosmology. And the best part is, at the Q and A afterward, I\u2019ve worked up a couple of Q\u2019s that will stump his sorry A.\nMrs Cooper: I don\u2019t know, Shelly. I thought we could do a little sightseeing.\nSheldon: What sight is better than your little boy embarrassing a Nobel laureate?\nMrs Cooper: Come on, Sheldon, we\u2019ll take your mom to see the Hollywood sign, the wax museum, the Walk of Fame.\nPenny: Ooh, maybe a little Rodeo Drive.\nMrs Cooper: Well, I can\u2019t spend twelve thousand dollars on a handbag, but it\u2019s free to look upon those who do with righteous condemnation.\nHoward: What do you say?\nSheldon: What do I say? I say you people need to stop ruining my mom\u2019s visit with your sushi, and your sadness and your slutty shirts. Stop it.\nHoward (after Raj whispers to him): He\u2019s not talking about your shirt. Your shirt is fine.\nScene: The kitchen.\nLeonard: These are delicious.\nMrs Cooper: The trick to pancakes is bacon grease. I cook everything in it.\nLeonard: Everything? Aren\u2019t you worried about your health?\nMrs Cooper: Oh, doctors are always changing their mind. One week bacon grease is bad for you. The next week we\u2019re not getting enough of it. Good morning, Shelly.\nSheldon: Mom, I want to apologize for my behaviour last night.\nMrs Cooper: Apology accepted.\nSheldon: Great. Now, you\u2019re going to love the Perlmutter lecture. Look, he will be stating that the universe is older than 6,000 years, but I thought you could stick your fingers in your ears and hum Amazing Grace during those parts.\nMrs Cooper: I am still going out with your friends.\nSheldon: But I apologized. And that was hard for me because I didn\u2019t do anything wrong.\nMrs Cooper: Shelly, I hung out with you in enough dusty lecture halls while you were growing up. I want to go sightseeing. So why don\u2019t you have some pancakes, get dressed and come with us.\nSheldon: I\u2019m not going, and you can\u2019t make me.\nMrs Cooper: You\u2019re right, I can\u2019t. Have a nice day.\nSheldon: Well, I\u2019m going to stand here until you change your mind.\nMrs Cooper: Well, then you are going to stand there all day.\nLeonard: I\u2019m just gonna take my bacon grease and slide over there.\nSheldon: I can\u2019t believe my own mother is abandoning me.\nMrs Cooper: I am not abandoning you. Sheldon, abandoning you is leaving you in a basket on a church doorstep. I am going to Hollywood and thank a wax Ronald Reagan for his service to our country.\nSheldon: We appear to be at a crossroads in our relationship, Mother.\nMrs Cooper: Well, I guess we are.\nLeonard: Sorry. Syrup.\nSheldon: All right, Mom. When you\u2019re at the Ripley\u2019s Believe It Or Not Museum, if they have an exhibit about a mother who threw away a chance to spend the day with the world\u2019s most wonderful son, believe it, because it\u2019s true. (Grabs pancakes and snatches syrup from Leonard\u2019s hand)\nLeonard: I hadn\u2019t\u2026\nScene: Amy\u2019s apartment.\nSheldon: That lecture was a waste of time. I made more accurate diagrams of the expansion of the early universe on the nursery wall with the contents of my diaper. (Sneezes)\nAmy: Are you getting sick?\nSheldon: No, I\u2019m just allergic to people who get Nobel Prizes for no good reason.\nAmy: Sheldon, is it possible that your foul mood, or, to use the clinical term, bitchiness, is because your mother isn\u2019t making you a priority?\nSheldon: No. Or to use the clinical term, nuh-uh.\nAmy: Are you sure? The infant-mother pair-bond is the building block of primate psychology.\nSheldon: Oh, there it is. It always comes back to monkeys with you. Just monkeys, monkeys, monkeys.\nAmy: Sheldon, we\u2019re all animals. And granted, there are aspects of you that are extraordinary, but when it comes to emotions and relationships, you\u2019re just like everybody else.\nSheldon: Are you trying to suggest that my emotional problems are no different than those of a stupid person?\nAmy: Actually, some research indicates that by not over-thinking, the less intelligent handle emotions better. (He sneezes again) Sure you\u2019re not coming down with a cold?\nSheldon: Oh, yes, the common cold. Just like everyone else. You\u2019d love that, wouldn\u2019t you?\nScene: A church.\nMrs Cooper: Oh, this one\u2019s sweet. You know, for your rosary rattlers.\nLeonard: Mrs. Cooper, we say Catholics, not rosary rattlers.\nMrs Cooper: My goodness, it\u2019s a wonder you people in California can talk at all.\nPenny: This is like the worst Hollywood tour ever.\nLeonard: What are you gonna do? She wanted to see churches.\nPenny: Hey, they have wine here, don\u2019t they?\nRaj (pointing at a crucifixion statue): Hey, none of our gods have abs like that.\nHoward: Yep, that\u2019s the last Jew who did sit-ups. And look where it got him.\nMrs Cooper: Hey, while we\u2019re here, why don\u2019t we all do some praying? Let\u2019s put a little church in this church.\nLeonard: Oh, I\u2019m not sure we should.\nMrs Cooper: It\u2019s easy. I\u2019ll show you how. Lord, Mary Cooper here. Coming to you from Gomorrah, California. I want to thank you for the blessing that is my little Shelly. I also want to thank you for the continued strength not to coldcock him with my Bible. All right, Penny, your turn.\nPenny: Okay, um, hey, God. What\u2019s up? Um, I\u2019m good, but, uh, it would be a big help to my family if you could get my brother to stop cooking meth. But no cops. Be cool.\nMrs Cooper: She also goes a little overboard on the love thy neighbour. Could probably use that chat you had with Mary Magdalene. Leonard, you\u2019re up. Wasserman, you\u2019re on deck.\nLeonard: Okay. I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s probably a little late to ask you to make me taller. Oh, um, if you could help out with me and my girlfriend. She\u2019s all the way in India. That would be great.\nMrs Cooper: Hear that? Girl trouble. Turns out we were both wrong on that front. How about you?\nHoward: Oh, me? No. Thanks, I\u2019m good. I\u2019m really just trying not to burst into flames.\nMrs Cooper: Rajesh?\nHoward: He says he\u2019s having trouble dropping those last five pounds.\nMrs Cooper: Huh, I might have gone with the talking-to-girls thing.\nHoward: No, you only get one wish.\nScene: A park bench. Sheldon is sitting. A stranger sits next to him.\nSheldon: Look at the two of us. Me, a highly regarded physicist. The kind of mind that comes along once, maybe twice in a generation. You, the common man, tired from your labours as a stockbroker, or vacuum cleaner salesman, or bootblack. But deep down inside, apparently we\u2019re just two peas in a pod. A regular pea, and the kind of pea that comes along once, maybe twice in a generation. Rain. Another great equalizer. Falling on the head of the brilliant and the unremarkable alike. (The stranger puts up an umbrella) Smarty-pants.\nScene: The kitchen.\nPenny: Oh, Mrs. Cooper, it smells so good.\nMrs Cooper: You take notes, darlin\u2019. The real way to get a man is with melted cheese and cream of mushroom soup. He\u2019ll die at 50 but his love will be true.\nSheldon (entering, soaked): I need a tissue.This one got wet.\nLeonard: Here.\nSheldon: Thank you. Yeah, I\u2019ve learned something today. You and I, in so many ways, other than intelligence and what counts, we\u2019re the same. (Sneezes)\nMrs Cooper: Sweetheart, are you sick?\nSheldon: I hope so, because if this is well, life isn\u2019t worth living.\nMrs Cooper: Oh, sugarpie, you are burning up. We\u2019ve got to get you to bed.\nSheldon: Okay.\nMrs Cooper: Don\u2019t worry. Mama\u2019s here to take care of her baby.\nSheldon: And just to be clear, only her baby and not these other people.\nMrs Cooper: Of course.\nSheldon: Can I have tea with honey and toast with the crust cut off?\nMrs Cooper: You can have whatever you want.\nSheldon: Thanks, Mom.You\u2019re the best.\nScene: Sheldon\u2019s bedroom.\nMrs Cooper: Boy, last time I put VapoRub on you, you didn\u2019t have hair on your chest.\nSheldon: I know, it filled in last year. I didn\u2019t get to spend a lot of time with you on this visit.\nMrs Cooper: And whose fault was that?\nSheldon: Yours.\nMrs Cooper: Shelly, you\u2019re not eight years old any more. We have to have a different relationship.\nSheldon: No, we don\u2019t. The one we have works great.\nMrs Cooper: Sweetheart, you are a grown man.\nSheldon: Or maybe I\u2019m part of a new species, that lives for hundreds of years, which means I\u2019m still basically a toddler.\nMrs Cooper: Oh, I so should have taken you to Houston.\nSheldon: Does this mean you\u2019re not going to sing Soft Kitty?\nMrs Cooper: No, I will always sing you Soft Kitty. (Sings) Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur\u2026\nLeonard (at door): Mrs. Cooper, were we supposed to take that pie out of the oven?\nSheldon: Get out!\nMrs Cooper: Well, that was rude.\nSheldon: Well, I know, but he means well. Sing.\nMrs Cooper: Happy kitty, sleepy kitty\u2026\nSheldon: What are you trying to pull, Mom? From the top.\nMrs Cooper (to God): This is what I\u2019m talking about. (Sings) Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur\u2026\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "7_15": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The apartment.\nAmy: Item 28, your pet name for me. Time\u2019s running out on this. You need to make a decision.\nSheldon: I submitted you a notarised list. \nAmy: I\u2019m sorry, but Gollum and Flakey are not acceptable.\nSheldon: Well, you don\u2019t like Princess Corncob, you don\u2019t like Fester, you\u2019re just impossible to please.\nAmy: We\u2019ll come back to that one. This brings us to the final item in our annual State of the Relationship Summit. Item 29, Valentine\u2019s Day.\nSheldon: Ah, the worst for last. Hmm. Classic Flakey.\nAmy: Before you get upset, I believe I\u2019ve come up with a way for us to celebrate the occasion that we both can enjoy.\nSheldon: People usually start a meeting with a joke, but you go ahead, end with one.\nAmy: I propose we spend a weekend at a bed-and-breakfast in Napa Valley.\nSheldon: I hate every word in that sentence. Including in, at, we and a.\nAmy: Come on, Sheldon. Why not?\nSheldon: For starters, a bed-and-breakfast forces you to eat with strangers at your table.\nAmy: One step ahead of you, Bernadette and Wolowitz are going with us.\nSheldon: Oh, very well. What are the sleeping arrangements? We\u2019ve only been dating for three years. If we were to share a room, people might talk.\nAmy: I got you your own room. \nSheldon: What if my room has a claw-foot bathtub?\nAmy: It doesn\u2019t. I know it makes you feel like you\u2019re bathing inside a monster.\nSheldon: Look, I appreciate the effort, but I\u2019m still unclear how this trip is supposed to be enjoyable for me.\nAmy: We\u2019re going to have Valentine\u2019s Day dinner on a fully functioning vintage train.\nSheldon: Vintage? Be specific.\nAmy: An Alcoa FA-4 diesel locomotive leading a train of meticulously restored 1915 Pullman first-class coaches.\nSheldon: Wow. I\u2019m feeling the urge to hug you. And one, and two, all right, Gollum, we\u2019re good.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The apartment.\nBernadette: Are you sure you guys don\u2019t want to come with us to Napa? You could probably still get a room.\nPenny: No, I think we\u2019re just gonna have a quiet weekend at home.\nLeonard: Plus, I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s a great idea to take Penny to where wine comes from. What? It\u2019s a joke. Oh, come on. We bust on each other. I wear dorky glasses, you might have a problem, it\u2019s all for laughs.\nPenny: That would really piss me off if I didn\u2019t have a buzz going on.\nSheldon: Howard, which pocket watch will you be wearing for dinner on the train?\nHoward: I\u2019m sorry, what?\nSheldon: Oh, I\u2019m afraid if we wear the same pocket watch, it will be embarrassing.\nHoward: I don\u2019t own a pocket watch.\nSheldon: Oh, my. Well, then my apologies for bringing up this sore spot.\nRaj: Since you two are gonna be around for Valentine\u2019s, would you mind watching Cinnamon?\nPenny: You have Valentine\u2019s plans? Which came out sounding way more surprised than I meant. Here, let me try that again. You have Valent\u2026 See? I can\u2019t do it.\nRaj: I don\u2019t have plans which is why I booked time on the big telescope that night.\nAmy: Well, an evening looking at the stars, that\u2019s still kind of romantic.\nRaj: Except I\u2019ll be alone.\nAmy: I\u2019m trying to put lipstick on a pig here. Work with me.\nLeonard: We\u2019d be happy to watch Cinnamon.\nPenny: Yeah.\nRaj: Thank you. Oh, and I\u2019d like for at least one of us to see some action, so if you guys happen to have sex, it\u2019s cool if she stays in the room.\nPenny: Hey, same goes for the two of you with Amy.\nScene: The Pullman dining car.\nAmy: What do you think, Sheldon?\nSheldon: It\u2019s magnificent. This is going to be the best Valentine\u2019s Day ever.\nAmy: I\u2019m so glad you like it.\nSheldon: I\u2019m prepared to say I love it, as soon as I confirm there are no hobos aboard.\nScene: The apartment. \nLeonard (on phone): Okay. Raj, I got it. Bye. (To Cinnamon) That was your daddy. He wanted me to say that he misses\u2026 Why am I doing this?\nPenny: Happy Valentine\u2019s Day.\nLeonard: Ooh, flowers and chocolates? Somebody\u2019s trying to get me out of my panties.\nPenny: Don\u2019t be surprised if you find five chocolates missing and three gross coconut ones with a bite taken out. It came that way when I bought it.\nLeonard: Got you a little something, too.\nPenny: Aw, jewellery. Oh, my God, Lakers tickets?\nLeonard: It gets better. Instead of me, you can take someone who will actually enjoy it.\nPenny: Aw. You are the best boyfriend ever.\nLeonard: Thank you. Seriously, please don\u2019t make me go.\nPenny: Should we take this little party to the bedroom?\nLeonard: Mm, don\u2019t have to, we have the whole place to ourselves.\nPenny: Oh, that\u2019s true. \nLeonard: In fact, if you want, we can do it right here on Sheldon\u2019s spot.\nPenny: That is the least sexy thing anyone\u2019s ever said to me.\nLeonard: To the bedroom.\nPenny: Yeah.\nScene: The dining car.\nWaiter: And for the entr\u00e9e, tonight\u2019s special is a seafood risotto. Do you have any questions?\nSheldon: Uh, I do. Uh, does this train car have the original link-and-pin coupler or the Miller Hook and Platform?\nWaiter: I\u2019m sorry, I meant questions about the food.\nSheldon: Oh, of course. Um, is the seafood risotto being served on a train car with the original link-and-pin coupler or the Miller Hook and Platform?\nAmy: Uh, I think we\u2019re gonna need a minute.\nMan in seat behind: Fun fact, it\u2019s neither. They actually use the AAR type E coupler. If you listen carefully when the locomotive disconnects, you\u2019ll hear the characteristic click-pshht-thunk of the knuckle.\nSheldon: Get out of town.\nHoward: Fun fact, I\u2019m gonna jump off this train.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: Hey, Cinnamon, guess who just did it human style.\nPenny: Oh, my God.\nLeonard: It\u2019s a little late, but I\u2019ll take it.\nPenny: No, Cinnamon ate the chocolates. That\u2019s really bad for dogs.\nLeonard: Oh, crap. What are we gonna do?\nPenny: We gotta get her to a vet right now.\nLeonard: I don\u2019t have a vet. I have a podiatrist, an optometrist, an allergist, a dermatologist, a urologist. You\u2019d think I\u2019d have a vet.\nPenny: Okay. There\u2019s one not far from here. Come on. Let\u2019s go.\nLeonard: Okay. Koothrappali was right. We should have let her watch.\nScene: The dining car.\nSheldon: Do another one, do another one.\nMan: Okay. Here\u2019s my impression of the Amtrak Acela barreling down the Eastern Corridor. Wch-wch-wch-wch-shhhh. Wch-wch-wch-wch-shhhh. Wch-wch-wch-wch-shhhh. \nSheldon: It\u2019s like there\u2019s a train in your mouth. Howard: Oh, yeah. I\u2019ve got one. Um, the Amtrak Wolverine coming into Chicago. Bwch-wch-wch-wch-wch-wch, bwch-wch-wch-wch-wch-wch. Ooo-ooo.\nMan: I\u2019ve been on that train. And I just was again.\nAmy: See if you guys can guess this one. Bang. Splat. Thud.\nSheldon: How many trains have you been on?\nMan: Tons. A box fell on my head at UPS six years ago. Now I just collect disability and ride trains.\nSheldon: Wow. Your life\u2019s amazing.\nMan: Not always. A box fell on my head at UPS six years ago. Now I just collect disability and ride trains.\nAmy: Why do I even try?\nBernadette: I\u2019m gonna fix this right now.\nHoward: Okay. Just make it look like an accident.\nBernadette: Excuse me. You are at Valentine\u2019s dinner with your girlfriend. Now get back over there and be with her.\nSheldon: You\u2019re right. That was insensitive of me. I have to go back to my table now. You should join us.\nMan: All right.\nBernadette: Great. Now there\u2019s two of \u2019em.\nScene: A vet\u2019s surgery.\nLady Vet: How much chocolate did she eat?\nPenny: A whole box.\nLeonard: Well, to be fair, you ate a lot of it before you gave it to me. \nPenny: So the point is I may have saved her life.\nVet: I\u2019m sorry, is this a joke to you?\nLeonard: No. Maybe to her.\nVet: How big a box of chocolate was it?\nPenny: Uh, something like this. I don\u2019t know. It came free with a full tank of gas.\nLeonard: Really? Do you know how much those Lakers tickets were?\nPenny: Do you know how much gas is?\nVet: Hey.\nPenny: Sorry.\nLeonard: Sorry.\nRaj: Oh, my God, Cinnamon, are you okay? I can\u2019t believe you two. You do whatever it takes to save her life. If she needs new organs, I\u2019ll buy any dog necessary and scrap them for parts.\nVet: You\u2019re the owner?\nRaj: Owner, father, soul mate, and if anything happens to her, your worst nightmare.\nVet: Well, she\u2019s not throwing up, which is a good sign. So, I\u2019m gonna take her in back, put her on fluids and give her something to absorb the toxins. \nRaj: Okay. Okay, thank you. Oh, if she\u2019s scared, you can sing to her. She likes Katy Perry. Oh, but don\u2019t do Firework, that gets her all riled up.\nVet: Got it. Should have been a dentist.\nScene: The dining car.\nMan: Okay, what was the best four-ten-four U.S. Locomotive ever built?\nSheldon: Trick question. There never was one.\nMan: Or was there? \nSheldon: What?\nMan: In 1944, the Pacific Railroad built number 6131, which rearranged the drivers and cylinders, solving the problem of the Q-1, creating a duplex-drive four-four-six-four.\nSheldon: In what world is a four-four-six-four a four-ten-four? \nHoward: A world I don\u2019t want to live in. Seriously, I no longer want to live in this world.\nMan: Hold on to your conductor\u2019s hat. You crank the second and third axles, creating a pair of internal connecting rods, and boom, four-ten-four. If you think about it, the Q-2 was like the four-ten-four America never made.\nSheldon: I may never stop thinking about it. Amy, what are the odds we run into this guy?\nWaiter: Better than you think.\nMan: You know, if you ask nicely, they\u2019ll let you visit the engine room.\nSheldon: I never want this day to end.\nAmy: It\u2019s feeling like it never will.\nSheldon: Come on.\nMan: Hey, did I tell you what happened to me at UPS?\nScene: The vets surgery.\nRaj: As if Valentine\u2019s Day wasn\u2019t bad enough, you try to kill my dog? And with cheap chocolate, no less?\nPenny: It wasn\u2019t cheap. It was free.\nLeonard: We\u2019re really sorry. It was an accident.\nPenny: Yeah, we weren\u2019t even out of the room that long.\nLeonard: Oh, no, come on. It was a while. It was a while.\nRaj: Oh, is Cinnamon gonna be okay?\nVet: She\u2019s responding well. We just want to keep her a little longer for observation.\nRaj: All right. Uh, would, would it be okay for me to see her? We\u2019re usually in bed by now, and I want her to know that I\u2019m here. Yes, we sleep together, and sometimes we spoon.\nVet: It\u2019s okay. I sleep with my dog, too. We\u2019re not supposed to let people in back, but I think I can make an exception.\nRaj: Thank you.\nVet: Come on. By the way, I sang her Katy Perry.\nRaj: Oh, yeah?\nVet: And I don\u2019t care what that obnoxious parrot back there says. I crushed it.\nPenny: I think there\u2019s something going on between the two of them.\nLeonard: Maybe, but you also think nine minutes isn\u2019t a while, so what do you know?\nScene: The dining car.\nHoward: You okay?\nAmy: Why? Because my boyfriend\u2019s off playing choo-choo with some weirdo?\nHoward: Well, to be fair, they\u2019re both weirdos.\nAmy: I don\u2019t know what made me think tonight would be any different.\nBernadette: Well, just the fact that you got him up here still says a lot. To be honest, I bet Howie 200\nbucks it wasn\u2019t gonna happen.\nHoward: I\u2019m going to the Lego store to get a big-ass R2-D2.\nBernadette: See? It\u2019s not just Sheldon. They\u2019re all idiots.\nHoward: She\u2019s right. \nBernadette: So, your boyfriend\u2019s a fixer-upper. Most of them are. I mean, look at this guy. You think he came like this? When I met him, he was a hot, goofy mess. Now, he\u2019s been to space. That\u2019s all me.\nHoward: I had a little to do with it.\nBernadette: Oh, sure you did. Who\u2019s Mama\u2019s big space man?\nHoward: I am.\nScene: The vets surgery.\nLeonard: They\u2019ve been in there, like, half an hour.\nPenny: Yeah, for future reference, that\u2019s a while.\nLeonard: How long should we stay?\nPenny: I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m kind of hungry.\nLeonard: I saw a Thai place next door.\nPenny: Oh. Okay. Oh. Oh. Hey.\nLeonard: How\u2019s she doing?\nPenny: How is everything?\nLeonard: Yeah.\nRaj: She\u2019s gonna be okay; they\u2019re gonna let me take her home.\nPenny: Oh, good.\nVet: So I want you to keep a close eye on her for the next 24 hours. Here are a few warning signs to look out for, and if you see any of them, don\u2019t hesitate to call.\nRaj: Oh. Thank you for taking such good care of my little girl.\nVet: My pleasure. Have a nice night.\nLeonard: Yes, thank you for all your help.\nPenny: Yeah. I\u2019m sorry if you didn\u2019t think we were taking it seriously. We love animals.\nVet: Oh, do you guys own any pets?\nPenny: No.\nVet: Good.\nScene: The dining car.\nHoward: I love you so much.\nBernadette: I love you, too.\nHoward: Sorry.\nBernadette: Sorry.\nMan: You guys missed a pretty great time. \nSheldon: The conductor and I have the same pocket watch. \nMan: It was crazy. \nSheldon: Dare I say loco? Oh, and, Amy, guess what? The conductor said as soon as he gets off work, he can come back to the bed and breakfast and play his banjo for us.\nAmy: Okay. I need to speak to my boyfriend in private, like, right now.\nHoward: There\u2019s a car with a glass roof. Want to go look at the stars?\nBernadette: Oh, that sounds so romantic.\nAmy: Oh, give it a rest.\nBernadette: Let\u2019s go.\nAmy: Why are you still here?\nSheldon: Excuse me. I think you\u2019re being a little rude.\nAmy: I\u2019m being rude? You\u2019ve been rude to me this entire evening.\nSheldon: How is that possible? I\u2019ve hardly spoken to you since we got on the train.\nMan: I\u2019m detecting a little friction between you two, and I don\u2019t want to be a third rail. Get it?\nSheldon: I get it.\nAmy: Leave.\nSheldon: What is your problem?\nAmy: It\u2019s Valentine\u2019s Day. We\u2019re supposed to be having a romantic weekend.\nSheldon: Oh, really? Because I remember you saying that this trip was going to be something we could both enjoy. Did you mean that, or were you just trying to trick me?\nAmy: Fine, it\u2019s true. I deserve romance, and I didn\u2019t know how else to make it happen.\nSheldon: Well, if you want romance, then let\u2019s have romance. Oh, look, there\u2019s wine. Mmm. Grape juice that burns. Uh, now let\u2019s gaze into each other\u2019s eyes, hmm? You blinked. I win.\nAmy: Sheldon.\nSheldon: Let\u2019s see. What\u2019s next? Oh, kissing\u2019s romantic.\nAmy: That was nice.\nSheldon: Good. Um, the conductor said if I come back to the engine room, he\u2019d show me how to bring the train through a crossing.\nAmy: Okay, have fun.\nSheldon: Do you want to come with me?\nAmy: Really? I do.\nMan: Hey, guys, wait up.\nScene: Raj\u2019s apartment.\nRaj: There you go. All cozy wozy. Here, let\u2019s see what the doctor says to keep an eye out for. Hmm. Rajesh, I was dreading Valentine\u2019s Day. Thank you for spending it with me. Yvette. Cinnamon, she-she gave me her phone number. If I\u2019d known it was that easy, I would have considered poisoning you months ago. Oh, what should I say? Oh, I know. I\u2019ll point out her name\u2019s Yvette, and that she\u2019s a vet. That\u2019s hysterical. She\u2019ll love it.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Hello.\nLeonard: Oh, hey. You\u2019re back. How was your trip?\nSheldon: It was wonderful. \nLeonard: Great. What did you do?\nSheldon: I made a new friend who likes trains as much as I do, uh, I kissed Amy on the lips, and, uh, the conductor played his banjo for me. Good night.\nLeonard: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I\u2019m gonna need more details.\nSheldon: Oh, well, my new friend\u2019s name was Eric. Um, Amy lips tasted like the brownie we had for dessert. Oh, and the banjo-playing conductor was missing a finger, but he made up for it with his can-do attitude.\nLeonard: No, hang on. Hang on. Are all those things equal to you?\nSheldon: Hmm. It never occurred to me to pick a favourite.\nLeonard: Well, give it a go.\nSheldon: I can\u2019t answer that without collecting additional data.\nLeonard: Additional data. You dog.\nSheldon: I\u2019m not sure how listening to other nine-fingered banjo players makes me dog, but all right.\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "3_19": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: Leonard and Penny are in Penny\u2019s bed.\nPenny: Having a little trouble catching your breath there?\nLeonard: No, no, I\u2019m good. If my P.E. teachers had told me this is what I was training for, I would have tried a lot harder.\nPenny: Do or do not. There is no try.\nLeonard: Did you just quote Star Wars?\nPenny: I believe I quoted Empire Strikes Back.\nLeonard: Oh, my God. I\u2019m lying in bed with a beautiful woman who can quote Yoda. I love you, Penny.\nPenny: Oh. Oh. Thank you.\nLeonard: You\u2019re welcome. I just wanted to put that out there.\nPenny: Oh, yeah, no, I, I\u2019m, I\u2019m glad.\nLeonard: Good. Glad is good.\nPenny: Yeah. Yeah. No, no. Um. So, it\u2019s getting pretty late. We should probably go to sleep.\nLeonard: Yeah.\nPenny: Okay.\nLeonard: Yeah.\nPenny: Hmm.\nLeonard: Yeah, probably.\nPenny: Okay, good night, sweetie.\nLeonard: Good night.\nCredits sequence\nScene: The apartment.\nHoward: Hey, Leonard, where do you come down on giant ants?\nRaj: Sheldon says impossible. Howard and I say not only possible, but as a mode of transportation, way cooler than a Batmobile.\nSheldon: You are ignoring the square-cube law. The giant ant would be crushed under the weight of its own exoskeleton. And for the record, the appropriate ranking of cool modes of transportation is jet pack, hoverboard, transporter, Batmobile, and then giant ant.\nLeonard: Seriously? You have nothing better to do than sit around and discuss the possibility of giant ants?\nHoward: What\u2019s with him?\nSheldon: Perhaps he\u2019s at a sensitive point in his monthly cycle.\nHoward: Are you saying he\u2019s man-struating?\nSheldon: Not literally. But as far back as the 17th century, scientists observed a 33-day fluctuation in men\u2019s hormone levels.\nRaj: Interesting. That might explain my weepy days in the middle of the month. You know what I\u2019m talking about.\nScene: The comic book store.\nHoward: Okay, forget giant ants. How about giant rabbits?\nRaj: Big or small, I don\u2019t like rabbits. They always look like they\u2019re about to say something, but they never do.\nSheldon: Rabbits do have a respiratory system that would support great size. And on a side note, they are one of the few mammals whose scrotum is in front of the penis.\nRaj: Maybe that\u2019s what they want to talk about.\nHoward: Leonard, where do you stand on giant rabbits and scrotal position?\nLeonard: I honestly don\u2019t care.\nRaj: Really? Because every time we\u2019ve talked about unusual animal genitals, you\u2019ve always had some pretty strong and controversial opinions.\nLeonard: What do you want from me? I just don\u2019t give a rat\u2019s ass.\nHoward: Would that be a giant rat\u2019s ass?\nSheldon: For the record, giant rats are possible.\nLeonard: Can we please talk about something else? Maybe something vaguely related to life as we know it on this planet?\nHoward: Okay, how about this for a topic, why is Leonard being a giant douche? Assuming giant douches are possible.\nSheldon: Of course they are. Leonard\u2019s being one.\nRaj: Maybe he\u2019s having a lover\u2019s spat with Penny.\nLeonard: No, there was no spat.\nHoward: Oh, but something happened.\nLeonard: I don\u2019t want to talk about it.\nSheldon: But I sense you\u2019re going to and I don\u2019t want to hear about it. Excuse me.\nHoward: What\u2019d you do, Romeo? You pour maple syrup all over your body and ask her if she was in the mood for a short stack?\nRaj: Did you think it would be funny to put on a pair of her panties and jump around, but it wound up just creeping her out?\nLeonard: What? No.\nRaj: I\u2019m just asking, dude. It happens.\nStuart: You guys still on for bowling tonight?\nSheldon: Oh, yes. In fact, I\u2019ve prepared some trash talk for the occasion. You bowl like your mama. Unless, of course, she bowls well. In which case, you bowl nothing like her.\nStuart: Oh. Ouch.\nSheldon: That is what is referred to as a burn on you.\nHoward: Did you ask her to start waxing?\nLeonard: No.\nRaj: Did you start waxing?\nLeonard: No.\nHoward: While making love, did you accidentally spank your own ass and cry out Mommy?\nLeonard: I\u2019m walking away from you now.\nHoward: That wasn\u2019t a no.\nRaj: Yeah, I think we\u2019re getting close.\nScene: The stairwell.\nHoward: Did you take a Benadryl and fall asleep while pleasuring her? Because you can die that way.\nRaj: Oh, that would be a good way to go.\nPenny: Hi.\nLeonard: Oh, hey.\nSheldon: Good, Penny, reminder, bowling tonight at seven o\u2019clock.\nPenny: Oh, right, bowling.\nLeonard: You don\u2019t have to come if you don\u2019t want to.\nPenny: No, no, it\u2019s okay. I mean, let\u2019s face it, you guys would get creamed without me.\nSheldon: We would indeed. In this particular case, your lack of femininity works to our advantage.\nPenny: It\u2019s always nice chatting with you, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Sarcasm?\nPenny: Thinly veiled contempt.\nSheldon: Remember, seven o\u2019clock.\nPenny: Got it.\nSheldon: Pacific Daylight time!\nPenny: Bite me!\nSheldon: Please reserve that butch spirit for the lanes.\nScene: The bowling alley.\nHoward: I thought you were bringing your own bowling shoes.\nSheldon: These are my own bowling shoes.\nHoward: Then what\u2019s with the disinfectant?\nSheldon: I know where my feet have been.\nStuart: Hey, Penny! And you guys. Albino Bob couldn\u2019t make it, so I brought a substitute. I believe some of you know Wil Wheaton.\nWil: Hi, Sheldon. How\u2019s it going?\nSheldon: Well, well, well. If it isn\u2019t Wil Wheaton, the Green Goblin to my Spider-Man, the Pope Paul the fifth to my Galileo, the Internet Explorer to my Firefox.\nWil: You\u2019re not still carrying a grudge because I beat you at that card tournament, are you?\nSheldon: I\u2019m the proud owner of Wil Wheaton stinks dot com, dot net, and dot org. What does that tell you?\nWil: It tells me that I am living rent-free right here (pointing at Sheldon\u2019s head). You ready to bowl?\nSheldon: Oh, I\u2019m ready. I don\u2019t know if Stuart told you what you\u2019re up against tonight, but before you stands the co-captain of the East Texas Christian Youth Holy Roller Bowling League championship team. Seven to twelve year-old division. Also, Penny\u2019s pretty good.\nWil: Great. Then it\u2019s on.\nSheldon: Oh, foolish Wil Wheaton, it was never off.\nTime lapse.\nWil: Yes!\nSheldon: A common spare. The Miss Congeniality of the bowling pageant. Before you jump on Twitter to tout your modest accomplishment, watch how it\u2019s really done. I am the ball. My thoughts are its thoughts. Its holes are my holes. (Gets a strike) Yes. Tweet that, Tweety Bird.\nHoward: Hey, I just wanted to tell you I\u2019m a big fan.\nWil: Oh, thanks.\nHoward: I\u2019m sure you\u2019re probably sick of Star Trek questions, but, Whoopi Goldberg, you ever hit that?\nRaj: Ah, beer. The magic elixir that can turn this poor, shy Indian boy into the life of the party. Oh, yeah.\nLeonard: Chilli cheese fry?\nPenny: Yes. I love chilli cheese fries.\nLeonard: Really? You love them?\nPenny: Yeah, why?\nLeonard: No reason. I\u2019m just glad to hear you\u2019re comfortable saying you love something.\nPenny: Do you really want to get into this right now?\nLeonard: Get into what? Why wouldn\u2019t you love the chilli cheese fries? They\u2019ve been in your life a long time. They make you happy. They deserve to know.\nPenny: Okay, look, you just caught me by surprise last night. I didn\u2019t know what to say.\nLeonard: Okay, well, now you\u2019ve had some time to think about it. So, what do you want to say?\nPenny: I\u2019m not sure.\nLeonard: How can you not be sure?\nPenny: Okay, this isn\u2019t the place to have this conversation.\nLeonard: No, the place to have the conversation was in bed after I said, I love you, and you said, Thank you, good night.\nPenny: Don\u2019t push it, Leonard.\nLeonard: I am not pushing anything.\nPenny: You are. You don\u2019t get to decide when I\u2019m ready to say I love you!\nRaj: Ah, the premature I love you.\nHoward: I guessed premature. Does that count?\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment door.\n \nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Penny, (knock, knock, knock) Penny, (knock, knock, knock) Penny.\nPenny: What?\nSheldon: This is for you.\nPenny: Ice cream?\nSheldon: I\u2019ve been familiarizing myself with female emotional crises by studying the comic strip Cathy. When she\u2019s upset, she says Ach and eats ice cream.\nPenny: Um, Ach.\nSheldon: If you were a cat, I would have brought you a lasagna.\nPenny: Did Leonard send you over here?\nSheldon: No, we haven\u2019t spoken since your abrupt departure last night caused us to forfeit to Stuart and his dastardly ringer Wil Wheaton.\nPenny: Yeah, I\u2019m sorry about that.\nSheldon: I\u2019m not too proud to admit that I cried myself to sleep.\nPenny: Again, I\u2019m sorry.\nSheldon: And let me tell you sleep did not come easily with Leonard in the next room singing along with Alanis Morrisette.\nPenny: You\u2019re kidding.\nSheldon: No. Clearly another woman in dire need of ice cream.\nPenny: All right, Sheldon, what part of this is supposed to make me feel better?\nSheldon: The part where I tell you I\u2019ve engineered a rematch with Stuart\u2019s team for tonight.\nPenny: Oh, honey, I don\u2019t know. Things are a little weird with Leonard right now.\nSheldon: You want me to remove him from the team? I\u2019m the captain, I can do that.\nPenny: No, no, that\u2019s okay. Just let me talk to him, and I\u2019ll get back to you.\nSheldon: When are you going to talk to him?\nPenny: I don\u2019t know.\nSheldon: He\u2019s in the laundry room now. Now would be a good time.\nPenny: You\u2019re not gonna leave me alone until I do it, are you?\nSheldon: Oh, I think we both know the answer to that question.\nScene: The laundry room.\nPenny: I think we should talk now.\nLeonard: What? No, it\u2019s okay. We don\u2019t have to talk \u2019cause there\u2019s nothing to talk about. Everything\u2019s good.\nPenny: Really? So, you didn\u2019t get all snarky \u2019cause I said something nice to a bowl of chilli fries?\nLeonard: All right, maybe I overreacted. So we\u2019re in two different places emotionally. So what? And maybe I\u2019m a little ahead of you. That\u2019s fine. You know. In fact, it makes sense, \u2019cause let\u2019s face it, I\u2019ve been in this relationship two years longer than you.\nPenny: Look, Leonard, you have to know how much I care about you. It\u2019s just that I\u2019ve said the L word too soon before, and it didn\u2019t work out very well.\nLeonard: Really? I wouldn\u2019t know what that\u2019s like.\nPenny: I\u2019m sorry. You know what I\u2019m talking about, though.\nLeonard: Yeah, I do.\nPenny: So, we\u2019re good?\nLeonard: Yes, that\u2019s what I\u2019m telling you. We are good. We are great.\nSheldon: All right! Fence mended, problem swept under the rug. Time to bowl! Yes, I was eavesdropping, there\u2019s a lot at stake here.\nScene: The bowling alley.\n \nSheldon: Attention, all bowlers. I\u2019ve taken the liberty of having these made for our rematch.\nPenny: The Wesley Crushers?\nSheldon: No, not the Wesley Crushers. The Wesley \u201cCrushers.\u201d\nPenny: I don\u2019t get it.\nLeonard: Wesley Crusher was Wil Wheaton\u2019s character on Star Trek.\nPenny: Still don\u2019t get it.\nSheldon: It\u2019s a blindingly clever play on words. By appropriating his character\u2019s name and adding the S, we imply that we we\u2019ll be the crushers of Wesley.\nPenny: Okay, I\u2019m sorry, honey, but the Wesley Crushers sounds like a bunch of people who like Wesley Crusher.\nSheldon: What? No! Again, it\u2019s not the Wesley Crushers. It\u2019s the Wesley \u201cCrushers.\u201d\nHoward: You know, if you want it to mean you\u2019re crushing Wesley, it\u2019d be the \u201cWesley\u201d Crushers.\nSheldon: Do you people even hear yourselves? It\u2019s not the Wesley Crushers. It\u2019s not the \u201cWesley\u201d Crushers. It\u2019s the Wesley \u201cCrushers.\u201d\nWil: Hey, look. They named their team after me.\nSheldon: No, it\u2019s not the\u2026 Never mind.\nStuart: So, we\u2019re all clear on the bet and the stakes?\nSheldon: Oh, yes. The losers will be publicly humiliated in a fashion to be chosen by the victor. FYI, I plan on having you publish a scientific paper expounding the discredited Velikovsky hypothesis.\nStuart: Ouch again.\nWil: Hey, Sheldon, I just wanted you to know that I\u2019m really looking forward to wiping the floor with you.\nSheldon: Oh, yes? Well, before I respond, let me ask you a question. Is your mother a good or poor bowler?\nTime lapse.\n \nWil: After you.\nSheldon: No, after you, as we are currently crushing you, Wesley.\nWil: It\u2019s customary for the player on the right-hand lane to bowl first.\nSheldon: All right.\nWil: It\u2019s a custom, not a rule.\nSheldon: I so loathe you.\nWil: That\u2019s right, Sheldon. Embrace the dark side.\nSheldon: That\u2019s not even from your franchise!\nStuart: I, um, I want you to know that even though we\u2019re on opposite sides, I, I bear you no ill will.\nPenny: Thank you, Stuart. It\u2019s nice to know.\nStuart: Mmm, mmm. People from opposite sides often have good relationships. You know, Romeo and Juliet, Tony and Maria from West Side Story, what\u2019s-his-name and the big blue chick in Avatar. I\u2019m gonna bowl now.\nSheldon: Be the ball, Howard.\nHoward: Leave me alone, Sheldon.\nSheldon: You weren\u2019t the ball.\nPenny: Hey, thanks.\nLeonard: This is fun, huh?\nPenny: Yeah.\nLeonard: It\u2019s good that we got out and did something physical.\nPenny: Mm-hmm.\nLeonard: Gets us out of our heads. You get in your head, you start to overthink, overanalyze, obsess, you worry. That\u2019s not what we\u2019re doing tonight. Tonight we\u2019re just throwing a ball at some pins.\nPenny: Yeah, that\u2019s right.\nLeonard: Mm-hmm, and someday, we don\u2019t know when, maybe you\u2019ll love me back. Ooh, I\u2019m up.\nAll (chanting): Shel-don! Shel-don! Shel-don! Shel-don!\nSheldon: Excuse me. I don\u2019t know who you\u2019re chanting for as I am currently the ball.\nAll (chanting): The ball! The ball! The ball! The ball! The ball! The ball!\nSheldon: Thank you, Jesus! As my mother would say.\nWil: I\u2019m glad you patched things up with your boyfriend.\nPenny: Oh, yeah, me, too.\nWil: It\u2019s always tough when the L bomb gets dropped and you\u2019re not ready for it.\nPenny: Tell me about it.\nWil: I dated this one girl, and I told her that I loved her, and she said she wasn\u2019t sure. And she strung me along for almost two years. It was brutal.\nPenny: Oh, I\u2019m sorry.\nWil: Thanks. Yeah, I wish she had just broken up with me right there, put me out of my misery.\nPenny: Really?\nWil: Yeah, would have been kinder.\nStuart: Wil, you\u2019re up.\nWil: Oh, that\u2019s me.\nSheldon: Did you let Wil Wheaton get in your head?\nPenny: What are you talking about?\nSheldon: He\u2019s evil. He plays evil mind games. Did he tell you his grandmother died?\nPenny: No!\nSheldon: Well, if he does, don\u2019t believe it. He\u2019s not above playing the dead meemaw card.\nWil: Yes!\nSheldon: Enjoy the accolades now, Wil Wheaton, but like your time on Star Trek: Next Generation, your smug self-satisfaction will be short-lived.\nLeonard: Penny, you\u2019re up.\nSheldon: All right, remember, his meemaw\u2019s alive and be the ball.\nPenny: Yeah, I got it.\nLeonard: We really need a strike here.\nPenny: I know.\nLeonard: So just take your time and concentrate.\nPenny: Leonard, stop pressuring me.\nLeonard: I\u2019m not pressuring you.\nPenny: Yeah, you are! Just back off!\nLeonard: Okay, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ll shut up.\nPenny: I didn\u2019t mean shut up.\nLeonard: Fine. Just tell me what to do, and I\u2019ll do it.\nPenny: No, this isn\u2019t fair to you, Leonard. I\u2019m sorry.\nSheldon: Wait! Where are you going? Penny, come back! I\u2019ll get you ice cream!\nLeonard: No, let her go.\nSheldon: Are you insane? If she leaves, it\u2019s over!\nLeonard: I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s already over.\nWil: Tough luck, Sheldon.\nSheldon: You did this, didn\u2019t you?\nWil: Do you think I would really break up a couple just to win a bowling match?\nSheldon: No, I suppose not.\nWil: Good. Keep thinking that.\nSheldon: Wheaton!\nScene: The comic book store.\nStuart: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, yeah, I\u2019m telling you the Match.com chicks are much looser than on eHarmony. You know, I, I gotta call you back. I won a bet, and it\u2019s time to collect.\n(The guys enter dressed as female superheroes. Howard is Batgirl, Sheldon is Wonder Woman, Leonard is Supergirl and Raj is Catwoman.)\nRaj: I don\u2019t know about you, but I feel empowered.\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "8_4": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The cafeteria.\nLeonard: Have you guys heard about this research team that\u2019s trying to transgenically manipulate chicken DNA to create some sort of chicken dinosaur?\nSheldon: Oh, I think that sounds wonderful.\nHoward: What? You\u2019re afraid of both dinosaurs and chickens.\nSheldon: Yes, but tell me a dinosaur chicken salad sandwich wouldn\u2019t hit the Mesozoic spot.\nRaj: Hey, guys.\nHoward: Hey.\nSheldon: Hello.\nRaj: We still on for tomorrow night?\nLeonard: Yeah. I\u2019m excited to finally meet your girlfriend.\nSheldon: Speaking of which, according to a recent study out of Oxford University, when someone takes on a new romantic partner, that person loses one or two close friends.\nHoward: Since when do you read social science?\nSheldon: I go to the bathroom like everybody else.\nRaj: Why would I lose friends just because I started dating someone?\nLeonard: Yeah, you didn\u2019t lose anyone when you met Amy. Yeah, well, no, this study refers to romantic partners. Not the way I would categorize the two of us.\nRaj: You guys kiss and hold hands.\nLeonard: I\u2019ve seen him do it. It\u2019s not romantic.\nRaj: Look, I\u2019m not the kind of guy who drops his friends just because he\u2019s in a relationship.\nLeonard: What happens if she doesn\u2019t like us?\nRaj: Well, hey, you\u2019re my dear friends. You\u2019ll get a Christmas card for a couple of years, and then you\u2019re dead to me.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The apartment.\nAmy: So, Howard, is Stuart still living with your mom?\nHoward: I don\u2019t want to talk about it.\nBernadette: But he\u2019s going to.\nHoward: My mom got him cable. In my whole life, growing up in that house, no cable. Do you know how many HBOs that leech had my mother get him? Seven. Seven HBOs. Seven.\nBernadette: Long story short, they have seven HBOs.\nRaj: Hey, guys.\nSheldon: Hello.\nRaj: Emily, you know almost everybody here.\nEmily: Hi.\nRaj: And this is Leonard, this is Penny.\nEmily: Oh, it\u2019s so nice to meet you.\nLeonard: Nice to finally meet you, too.\nPenny: Hi.\nEmily: Hello.\nLeonard: Wow, Raj, you were not lying about her.\nRaj: I told you she exists.\nPenny: Hey, I hear you\u2019re a dermatologist.\nEmily: Uh, yeah, I\u2019m a resident at Huntington Hospital.\nSheldon: Oh, I like their emergency room. Yeah, even if it turns out you don\u2019t have Dengue fever, they still let you take a lollipop.\nBernadette: You know, Penny just started training to be a pharmaceutical sales rep. Maybe she can practice on you some time.\nPenny: Oh, it would be great to practice on a real doctor.\nEmily: Yeah. I\u2019m sure that\u2019d be fine.\nSheldon: I have some odd freckles on my buttocks. Can I make an appointment for you to look at them?\nEmily: Um, okay, I guess.\nAmy: I\u2019m with him three years, nothing. She\u2019s with him two minutes, and he\u2019s taking his pants off.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment.\nBernadette: Last night was fun. What did you think of Emily?\nPenny: I don\u2019t know. I kind of got the sense she didn\u2019t like me.\nBernadette: Did she say she didn\u2019t like you?\nPenny: Of course not. No one ever says they don\u2019t like you straight to your face.\nAmy: We have led different lives.\nBernadette: You guys just met. Why would she feel that way?\nPenny: It\u2019s just this vibe I got.\nBernadette: I\u2019m sure you\u2019re worried about nothing.\nPenny: Yeah. You\u2019re probably right. I used to think my high school P.E. teacher didn\u2019t like me, but it turned out, she liked me a little too much.\nBernadette: Really?\nPenny: Yeah. It was fine. We went to a Melissa Etheridge concert, I got an A, it all worked out.\nBernadette: When you go to Emily\u2019s office to practice, you\u2019ll see. It\u2019s fine.\nPenny: Yeah, I hope you\u2019re right.\nAmy: You really went your entire life without anyone saying I hate you to your face?\nPenny: Yeah.\nAmy: I\u2019d say it now, but look at those cheekbones.\nScene: Capital Comics.\nSheldon: I miss Stuart\u2019s place. All this loud music and exposed brick. What, is this a comic book store, or a rave at the third little pig\u2019s house?\nHoward: Yep, I wish Stuart would reopen. I hate this place, too.\nLeonard: Okay, him I believe because he\u2019s an 80-year-old man in a 15-year-old\u2019s tee shirt. But you\u2019re just upset about Stuart and your mom and all their HBOs.\nHoward: Yes, I am. You know, I can\u2019t even watch Game of Thrones now without thinking of mother saying, Stuart, which one is Thrones?\nRaj: You know, he might not reopen. He didn\u2019t get a lot of money from the insurance company.\nSheldon: Oh, boy, if there is one thing that gets my goat, it\u2019s those dad-gum insurance companies.\nLeonard: Why? Because they won\u2019t get off your lawn? Is Stuart trying to get a loan, or, or find investors?\nHoward: All I know is, he\u2019s got my mother buying four-ply toilet paper. I mean, four-ply. If his butt is so delicate, why doesn\u2019t he just use an angora rabbit?\nSheldon: For starters, they shed and bite.\nLeonard: Hey, here\u2019s a thought. Why don\u2019t we put up the rest of the money that Stuart needs?\nRaj: So, we\u2019d be, like, owners of a comic book store?\nLeonard: It\u2019s kind of a dream come true.\nHoward: That does sound fun.\nRaj: Ooh, maybe we could come up with a business plan to compete with this place.\nSheldon: I\u2019ll give you a plan right now. Step one, open comic book store. Step two, start rumour this comic book store gives you genital warts. Step three, buy a big bag to put the money in.\nLeonard: It\u2019s not that bad.\nScene: Emily\u2019s surgery. \nPenny: Hey.\nEmily: Hi.\nPenny: Thank you so much for letting me practice my sales pitch on you. I really appreciate it.\nEmily: Sure.\nPenny: Um, I brought coffee. I wasn\u2019t sure what you like, so I got a regular, a cappuccino and a Chai tea. Since you like Raj, I thought you might be into that.\nEmily: Thanks. If we could get started. I\u2019m a little busy.\nPenny: Oh, yeah, sure. Let me just get out my materials. Leonard gave me this briefcase. He used to carry it around in high school. You can still see the dent where they whacked him with it. Okay, I would like to talk to you about our new birth control pill, Femevra.\nEmily: Great.\nPenny: So, Femevra\u2019s triphasic design provides balanced hormonal exposure.\nEmily: All right.\nPenny: It has also been shown to cause significantly fewer side effects than other oral contraceptives. Although it can cause acne, which, if you ask me, kind of increases its effectiveness as a contraceptive.\nEmily: Funny.\nPenny: Okay, I\u2019m sorry. Did we get off on the wrong foot? Because since the other night, I kind of feel like you might have a problem with me.\nEmily: No, it\u2019s fine.\nPenny: Are you sure, because it doesn\u2019t seem fine?\nEmily: Okay. If you really want to talk about this, I do have a problem.\nPenny: Oh, my God. Tell me, what did I do?\nEmily: Look, it\u2019s nothing. It\u2019s just, Raj told me that a while ago, you two hooked up.\nPenny: What? Oh, why would he say that?\nEmily: Did it not happen?\nPenny: Well, I wouldn\u2019t exactly call it a hook-up.\nEmily: Did you kiss?\nPenny: Yeah.\nEmily: Were you naked?\nPenny: Yeah.\nEmily: So, it was a hook-up.\nPenny: No. Yeah.\nScene: The apartment. \nSheldon: So, what are some ways we could set our comic book store apart from the competition?\nLeonard: Oh, kids buy comic books. It would be great to figure out a way to get more kids in the store.\nHoward: You know, when I was a kid, I loved going there, but I could never get a ride.\nRaj: Ooh, what if we got a van and drove around and picked kids up?\nSheldon: Nice. You mean, like at parks and schools?\nHoward: Toy stores, puppet shows.\nLeonard: Hold on. So, your idea is to get a van and cruise the streets looking for kids to pick up?\nSheldon: Yes.\nLeonard: And are you gonna use candy to lure them in?\nRaj: We are now.\nPenny: You told Emily we hooked up?\nRaj: Um, well, in my defence, I tell everybody.\nPenny: Why would you say that?\nRaj: We were having a conversation about past lovers.\nPenny: We weren\u2019t lovers. Come on. Everyone knows we didn\u2019t sleep together. We got drunk and fooled around. Why couldn\u2019t you just leave me out of it?\nRaj: Well, we were being honest. You would leave me out of the conversation with the next guy if you dumped Leonard?\nLeonard: Why say it?\nPenny: Yes.\nRaj: Well, I would never leave you off my list, and not just because, without you, we\u2019re playing fast and loose with the word list.\nPenny: Well, good job. Now she hates me. Ugh.\nRaj: Great.\nSheldon: On the bright side, that Oxford study was right. One friend down. I wonder who you\u2019re going to lose next.\nRaj: You, okay? It\u2019s you. You\u2019re, you\u2019re next.\nSheldon: No. You\u2019re crazy about me.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment.\nPenny: I don\u2019t know what Emily\u2019s so upset about anyway. Even if I had slept with him, so what? Everyone has a past.\nAmy: Hmm-hmm.\nPenny: Almost everyone has a past.\nBernadette: Come on, look how pretty you are. I\u2019m sure this isn\u2019t the first girl to hate you.\nPenny: It\u2019s not.\nBernadette: And I\u2019m sure you can turn it around.\nPenny: How? You can\u2019t force someone to like you.\nAmy: What if you just hang around and act like her friend until you wear her down? I mean, next thing you know, you\u2019re in her home, you\u2019re eating her food, drinking her wine.\nPenny: No, that won\u2019t work.\nAmy: You\u2019re right. Cheers.\nBernadette: Oh, I know. Why don\u2019t you use your sales training to go back down there and sell yourself?\nPenny: What?\nBernadette: Yeah. But instead of selling a drug, you\u2019d be selling Penny. it\u2019s cute.\nPenny: It\u2019s stupid.\nBernadette: Well, maybe people would like you more if you didn\u2019t crap all over their ideas.\nAmy: I\u2019m gonna go with Penny on this one. Then again, why wouldn\u2019t I? I mean, we go way back.\nPenny: Oh, my God. I didn\u2019t used to like you.\nAmy: Shh. Amy\u2019s here now.\nScene: Capital Comics.\nSheldon: You know, the more I think about it, the more intrigued I am about having our own store.\nHoward: We\u2019ll get to see all the new stuff before it hits the shelves.\nSheldon: And we\u2019ll get to have fun interactions with our customers. Like, this isn\u2019t a library, buy it or get out.\nHoward: You say things like that all the time.\nSheldon: Yes, but as a store owner, I\u2019ll finally have a good comeback to, You don\u2019t work here, shut up.\nLeonard: Uh, do you know how Penny told Raj he should have left her off his list?\nHoward: Yeah.\nLeonard: Well, do you think when she and I had that conversation, she left people off her list?\nSheldon: I\u2019m sure she did.\nLeonard: Why?\nSheldon: Because if she hadn\u2019t, she\u2019d still be wading through the list.\nLeonard: Will you stay out of this?\nSheldon: If only Penny had said that once in a while.\nHoward: Hey, what difference does it make? You\u2019re the one she wants to marry.\nLeonard: That\u2019s true.\nHoward: Yeah, and I\u2019m not sure that complete honesty is always the best thing for a relationship.\nSheldon: Yeah, he\u2019s right. Once, in a moment of candour, I told Amy that her hair reminded me of a duck caught in an oil spill. She stormed out. Which was sad, because we were playing Scrabble, and I had all the letters to spell persimmon.\nLeonard: Why are you even part of this conversation? You don\u2019t know anything about women.\nSheldon: I know that if I had a wife or a fianc\u00e9e, I\u2019d ask her first before I invested money in a comic book store.\nHoward: He\u2019s right.\nSheldon: Yeah, well, of course I am. I was also right about her hair. It did everything but quack.\nScene: The stairwell.\nLeonard: There\u2019s something I wanted to run past you.\nPenny: What\u2019s up?\nLeonard: Mm, the guys and I were thinking about investing in Stuart\u2019s comic book store. Is that okay?\nPenny: Why are you asking me?\nLeonard: Well, you know, we\u2019re engaged, and it\u2019s kind of a big deal financially. It seems like something we should talk about.\nPenny: Oh. Well, would you consider mounds of credit card debt kind of a big deal financially?\nLeonard: Yeah.\nPenny: Huh.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s apartment.\nHoward: Mm. So, me and the guys were talking about this great investment opportunity.\nBernadette: Nope.\nHoward: But you didn\u2019t hear what it was.\nBernadette: I know.\nHoward: Oh, come on.\nBernadette: Fine. What is it?\nHoward: It\u2019s to help reopen the comic book store.\nBernadette: Nope.\nHoward: Well, hear me out.\nBernadette: Howard, you know we\u2019re saving up for a house.\nHoward: I know, but all the guys are doing it. We\u2019re splitting it four ways, so it\u2019s really not that much money.\nBernadette: It just seems like a risky investment.\nHoward: I get that. I, okay, look, the real reason this is important is, before my dad left me and my mom, he used to take me to the comic book store. It was one of the few things we did together.\nBernadette: Oh. Howie, I had no idea.\nHoward: Well, I don\u2019t like to talk about it.\nBernadette: Oh, baby. That story\u2019s made up, isn\u2019t it?\nHoward: That\u2019s how much buying a comic book store means to me.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: I\u2019d like your honest opinion on something.\nAmy: Of course.\nSheldon: Now, before I start, I need you to know that I\u2019m very excited about this, and anything you say that isn\u2019t enthusiastically supportive will throw our entire relationship into question. So, keep an open mind.\nAmy: I\u2019m feeling a little backed into a corner, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Perfect. Now, I\u2019m considering investing in Stuart\u2019s comic book store.\nAmy: Interesting. Can you see how a grown man, an accomplished scientist, who invests in a store that sells picture books about flying men in colourful underwear might be wasting both his financial and intellectual resources?\nSheldon: No.\nAmy: Then I think it\u2019s a terrific idea.\nSheldon: Great. Wait till you hear about our van.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment.\nRaj: Hey.\nPenny: Hi.\nRaj: Thanks for inviting us over.\nPenny: Oh, thank you for coming.\nEmily: Uh, listen, Penny, before you start, I just want to apologise for being so rude the other day in my office.\nPenny: No, no. No need to apologise.\nRaj: Excuse me, can I say something? I just love both you guys, and I want you to get along. And when I say love I meant as a friend. And, uh, way too soon, right?\nPenny: Okay, sit down. Listen, Emily, what happened between me and Raj was a long time ago.\nRaj: It was, and I may have made it seem like a bigger deal than I should have.\nPenny: Yeah, and Leonard and I are engaged now, and I\u2019m just hoping we can put this whole thing behind us.\nEmily: Mm. I\u2019d like that, too. Yeah, I thought I\u2019d be okay with it, but then I saw how pretty you are.\nPenny: Oh, that\u2019s so sweet. I mean, look at you, you are gorgeous.\nRaj: It\u2019s true, you\u2019re both gorgeous. Kind of says something about the man who could bed you both. You get why I\u2019ve been alone most of my adult life.\nScene: Mrs Wolowitz\u2019s house.\nStuart: So, what brings you by?\nHoward: Well, I don\u2019t need a reason, it\u2019s my house.\nStuart: Technically, it\u2019s your mom\u2019s house, but we certainly want you to feel welcome.\nHoward: I\u2019m always welcome.\nStuart: Mm, just try and call first.\nBernadette: Okay, let\u2019s get down to business. Howie was thinking about putting up some money to help you reopen the store, but before that happens, I have a few questions.\nStuart: Oh. I appreciate the offer, but actually your mother already gave me the money.\nHoward: What?\nStuart: Yeah. I told her it was too much, but she said she was happy to help out her bubala.\nHoward: Excuse me. Ma, you are cancelling that cheque, and Stuart is not your bubala, I\u2019m your bubala. You can\u2019t have more than one bubala.\nStuart: I don\u2019t know who he\u2019s talking to. She\u2019s at Target, buying me shirts.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment. \nRaj: I\u2019m so glad we could work this all out.\nPenny: Yeah, me, too.\nEmily: You know, we should have dinner one night with you and Leonard.\nPenny: Oh, we would love that.\nRaj: Great.\nPenny: Okay, good night, guys.\nEmily: All right, night.\nPenny: Bye.\nEmily and Penny (simultaneously): I hate her.\nScene: The apartment. \nRaj: I\u2019m really disappointed we\u2019re not gonna have our own comic book store.\nLeonard: I know. I was looking forward to it.\nSheldon: It would\u2019ve been so nice to have a place that was ours, where we could just sit and read comics in peace.\nHoward: With comfy seats.\nRaj: And snacks.\nSheldon: Well, I guess it was too good to be true.\nLeonard: Yeah.\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "1_7": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The apartment, the living room.\nHoward: Watch this, it\u2019s really cool. Call Leonard Hofstadter.\nHoward\u2019s phone: Did you say, call Helen Boxleitner?\nHoward: No. Call Leonard Hofstadter.\nHoward\u2019s phone: Did you say, call Temple Beth Sader. \nHoward: No.\nLeonard: Here, let me try. Call McFlono McFloonyloo. Heh-heh. \nHoward\u2019s phone: Calling Rajesh Koothrappali. (Raj\u2019s phone rings).\nRaj: Oh, that\u2019s very impressive. And a little racist. \nSheldon: If we\u2019re all through playing mock the flawed technology, can we get on with Halo night, we were supposed to start at eight, it is now 8:06.\nLeonard: So? We\u2019ll start now.\nSheldon: Yes, first we have to decide if those lost six minutes will be coming out of game time, bathroom time or the pizza break.\nRaj: We can split it two, two and two.\nHoward: If we\u2019re having anchovies on the pizza we can\u2019t take it out of bathroom time. (There is a knock on the door.)\nSheldon: Oh, what fresh hell is this?\nLeonard (opening door): Hey Penny, come on in.\nPenny: Hey guys. \nHoward: See a Penny, pick her up, and all the day you\u2019ll have good luck.\nPenny: No you won\u2019t. Uh, can I hide out here for a while.\nLeonard: Sure. What\u2019s going on.\nPenny: Well, there\u2019s this girl I know from back in Nebraska, Christie, well anyway she called me up and she\u2019s like \u201cHey, how\u2019s California,\u201d and I\u2019m like \u201cAwesome\u201d \u2018cos, you know, it\u2019s not Nebraska, and the next thing I know she\u2019s invited herself out here to stay with me. \nSheldon: 8:08.\nPenny: Anyway, she got here today, and she\u2019s just been in my apartment, yakkety-yakking about every guy she\u2019s slept with in Omaha, which is basically every guy in Omaha, and washing the sluttiest collection of underwear you have ever seen in my bathroom sink.\nHoward: Well, is she doing it one thong at a time, or does she just throw it all in, like some sort of erotic bouillabaisse.\nPenny: He really needs to dial it down.\nLeonard: So, if you don\u2019t like this Christie, why are you letting her stay? \nPenny: Well, she was engaged to my cousin while she was sleeping with my brother, so she\u2019s kind of family. \nSheldon: You know, I apologise for my earlier outburst, who needs Halo when we can be regaled with the delightfully folksy tale of the whore of Omaha?\nLeonard: Oh, I don\u2019t think she\u2019s a whore.\nPenny: No, yeah she\u2019s definitely a whore. I mean, she has absolutely no standards, this one time, she was at\u2026 where\u2019s Howard?\nHoward (voice off): Bonjour mademoiselle, I understand you\u2019re new in town. \nSheldon: Oh good grief.\nCredit Sequence\nScene: Penny, Sheldon, Raj and Leonard stand in the apartment doorway. Romantic music plays from Penny\u2019s apartment door. \nPenny: Ugh, I cannot believe Christie let Howard into my apartment. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nSheldon: And I cannot believe people pay for horoscopes, but on a more serious note it\u2019s 8:13 and we\u2019re still not playing Halo. \nLeonard: Okay, fine, we\u2019ll just play one on one until he gets back. \nSheldon: One on one? We don\u2019t play one on one, we play teams, not one on one. One on one!\nLeonard: Well the only way we can play teams at this point is if we cut Raj in half.\nRaj: Oh, sure, cut the foreigner in half, there\u2019s a billion more where he came from. \nPenny: Hey, if you guys need a fourth, I\u2019ll play.\nLeonard: Great idea.\nSheldon: Uh, no. The wheel was a great idea. Relativity was a great idea. This is a notion, and a rather sucky one at that. \nPenny: Why?\nSheldon: Why? Oh, Penny, Penny, Penny.\nPenny: Oh, what, what, what? \nSheldon: This is a complex battle simulation with a steep learning curve, there are myriad weapons, vehicles and strategies to master, not to mention an extremely intricate back-story.\nPenny (picking up a controller, there is the sound of an explosion from the television): Oh cool, whose head did I just blow off? \nSheldon: Mine. \nPenny: Okay, I got this, lock and load boys. \nLeonard: It\u2019s the only way we can play teams. \nSheldon: Yes, but whoever\u2019s her partner will be hamstrung by her lack of experience and not to mention that fact that sh\u2026. (another explosion)\nPenny: Ha-ha, there goes your head again.\nSheldon: Okay, this isn\u2019t at all good sportsmanship to shoot somebody who\u2019s just respawned, you need to give them a chance to (explosion) now come on!\nTime shift\nSheldon: Raj, Raj, she\u2019s got me cornered, cover me.\nPenny: Cover this, suckers. Ha-ha-ha!\nLeonard: Penny, you are on fire.\nPenny: Yeah, so is Sheldon. \nSheldon: Okay, that\u2019s it, I don\u2019t know how, but she is cheating. No-one can be that attractive and be this skilled at a video game. \nPenny: Wait, wait, Sheldon, come back, you forgot something. \nSheldon: What?\nPenny: This plasma grenade. (Explosion.) Ha! Look, it\u2019s raining you! \nSheldon: You laugh now, you just wait until you need tech support. \nPenny: Gosh, he\u2019s kind of a sore loser, isn\u2019t he?\nLeonard: Well, to be fair, he is also a rather unpleasant winner. \nPenny: Well, it\u2019s been fun.\nLeonard: You know, Penny, we make such a good team, maybe we could enter a couple of Halo tournaments sometime.\nPenny: Or we could just have a life. \nLeonard: I guess for you that\u2019s an option.\nPenny: Good night, Leonard.\nLeonard: Good night.\nPenny: As usual, nice talking to you Raj (leaves.) \nRaj: What do you suppose she meant by that?\nLeonard: She\u2019s an enigma, Raj. \nSheldon: And another thing, there\u2019s a certain ethic to the game, Penny, a well estab\u2026\nLeonard: She\u2019s gone, Sheldon. \nSheldon: Well she could have said goodbye. \nPenny (entering again): Okay, I have a problem.\nSheldon: It\u2019s called carpal tunnel syndrome, and quite frankly you deserve it. \nLeonard: What\u2019s wrong?\nPenny: Um, well, Howard and Christie are\u2026 kind of\u2026 hooking up in my bedroom. \nLeonard: Are you sure?\nPenny: Look, I grew up on a farm, okay, from what I heard they\u2019re either having sex or Howard\u2019s caught in a milking machine. Do you mind if I stay here tonight?\nLeonard: No, take the couch, or my bed, I just got new pillows, hypo-allergenics. \nPenny: Uh, the couch is good.\nSheldon: Hold that thought, Leonard, a moment.\nLeonard: Let me guess, you have a problem with this.\nSheldon: Where do I begin? \nLeonard: It\u2019s up to you, crazy person\u2019s choice. \nSheldon: Well first, we don\u2019t have house guests, frankly if I could afford the rent I\u2019d ask you to leave. \nLeonard: Your friendship means a lot to me as well, what else? \nSheldon: Well, our earthquake supplies, we have a two day, two man kit.\nLeonard: So? \nSheldon: So, if there is an earthquake and the three of us are trapped here, we could be out of food by tomorrow afternoon. \nLeonard: I\u2019m sorry, are you suggesting that if we let Penny stay we might succumb to cannibalism?\nSheldon: No-one ever thinks it will happen until it does. \nLeonard: Penny, if you promise not to chew the flesh off our bones while we sleep, you can stay. \nPenny: Hu.. what?\nSheldon: He\u2019s engaging in reductio-ad-absurdum. It\u2019s the logical fallacy of extending someone\u2019s argument to ridiculous proportions and then criticising the result, and I do not appreciate it. \nLeonard: I\u2019ll get you a blanket and a pillow. \nSheldon: Okay, well since I\u2019m obviously being ignored here, let\u2019s go over the morning schedule, I use the bathroom from 7 to 7:20, plan your ablutions and bodily functions accordingly. \nPenny: How am I supposed to plan my bodily functions?\nSheldon: I suggest no liquids after 11pm. \nLeonard: Here you go.\nPenny: Thanks Leonard. (Arranges pillows on left of couch.)\nSheldon: Hmmph, wrong. \nPenny: I\u2019m listening.\nSheldon: Your head goes on the other end.\nPenny: Why? \nSheldon: It\u2019s culturally universal, a bed, even a temporary bed, is always oriented with the headboard away from the door. It serves the ancient imperative of protecting oneself against marauders.\nPenny: I\u2019ll risk it.\nSheldon: Hm! \nPenny: Anything else I should know.\nSheldon: Yes. If you use my toothbrush I\u2019ll jump out that window. Please don\u2019t come to my funeral. Have a good night. \nLeonard: Sorry about that.\nPenny: That\u2019s okay. \nLeonard: FYI, his toothbrush is the red one in the plexiglass case under the UV light. \nPenny: Got it.\nLeonard: Well, sleep tight.\nPenny: Thanks. \nLeonard: Funny expression, sleep tight. It refers to the early construction of beds which featured a mattress suspended on interlocking ropes which would occasionally\u2026 sleep tight. \n(Penny turns off light and lies down on couch. Across the room, Raj is still in the kitchen, eating a sandwich. Realising everyone has forgotten about him, he quietly lets himself out. Penny hears the door close, looks worried, then moves her head to the other end of the couch.)\nScene: The following morning. Sheldon is in the kitchen making breakfast. He crosses to the couch, sees Penny sleeping there, looks lost. He is about to sit down on Penny when Leonard enters.\nLeonard: What are you doing? \nSheldon: Every Saturday since we have lived in this apartment, I have awakened at 6:15, poured myself a bowl of cereal, added a quarter cup of 2% milk, sat on this end of this couch, turned on BBC America and watched Doctor Who. \nLeonard: Penny\u2019s still sleeping.\nSheldon: Every Saturday since we have lived in this apartment, I have awakened at 6:15, poured myself a bowl of cereal\u2026.\nLeonard: I know, I know, look, you have a TV in your room, why don\u2019t you just have breakfast in bed? \nSheldon: Because I am neither an invalid nor a woman celebrating Mother\u2019s Day. \nPenny: Uh, what time is it?\nLeonard: Almost 6:30. \nPenny: I slept all day?\nLeonard: Oh, no, it\u2019s 6:30 in the morning.\nPenny: What the hell is your problem?\nSheldon: Okay, this cereal has lost all its molecular integrity, I now have a bowl of shredded wheat paste.\nHoward (entering): Ola, nerd-migos. \nPenny: Why do you people hate sleep? Are you wearing my robe?\nHoward: Oh, yeah, sorry, I\u2019ll have it cleaned.\nPenny: That\u2019s okay, keep it. Where\u2019s Christie.\nHoward: In the shower. Oh, by the way, where did you get that loofah mitt, yours reaches places that mine just won\u2019t.\nPenny: Y-you used my loofah?\nHoward: More precisely we used your loofah. I exfoliated her brains out! \nPenny: You can keep that too.\nHoward: Ah, well then we\u2019ll probably need to talk about your stuffed bear collection.\nChristie (voice off): Howard?\nHoward: In here my lady.\nChristie (entering): Mmmm, there\u2019s my little engine that could.\nHoward: chka-chka-chka-chka-chka-chka-chka (they kiss).\nSheldon: Well there\u2019s one beloved children\u2019s book I\u2019ll never read again.\nChristie: Hi, Christie.\nLeonard: Leonard. \nSheldon: I\u2019m Sheldon.\nChristie: Right, you\u2019re Howard\u2019s entourage. \nPenny: Uh, so Christie, what are your plans?\nChristie: Oh, well, Howard said he\u2019d take me shopping in Beverley Hills. \nPenny: Yeah, no, I meant plans to find some place to live. Other than with me, not that I don\u2019t love having you, but it\u2019s\u2026 a little crowded.\nLeonard: Penny, you\u2019re always welcome to stay with us.\nSheldon: Oh, terrific, now we\u2019re running a cute little B&B.\nHoward: Let me offer a little outside the box thinking here, why doesn\u2019t Christie stay with me.\nLeonard: For one thing you live with your mother.\nHoward: I do not, my mother lives with me. \nSheldon: Well then, it\u2019s all settled, Christie will stay with Howard, Penny can go back to her apartment, and I\u2019ll watch the last 24 minutes of Doctor Who, although at this point it\u2019s more like Doctor Why Bother. \nLeonard: Sheldon you just can\u2019t dictate\u2026\nSheldon: No more talking, everybody go. \nHoward: So, what do you say, you wanna repair to Castle Wolowitz? \nChristie: What is that, like a Mexican deli?\nHoward: I\u2019m sorry, I should have mentioned this earlier, my last name is Wolowitz.\nChristie: Oh, that\u2019s so cool. My first Jew!\nSheldon: I imagine there aren\u2019t many kosher corn-huskers. \nChristie: But you\u2019re still taking me shopping, right?\nHoward: Anything you want.\nChristie: Okay, I\u2019ll go pack my stuff.\nHoward: When they perfect human cloning I\u2019m going to order twelve of those.\nLeonard: Howard, can\u2019t you see she\u2019s using you?\nHoward: Who cares, last night she pulled off her blouse and I wept!\nPenny: Look, Howard, I know her, okay, she\u2019ll have sex with anyone as long as they keep buying her things. \nHoward: Really?\nPenny: Yeah.\nHoward: Yay! If you\u2019ll excuse me, I have some Bar-Mizvah bonds to cash. \nScene: A Chinese restaurant. \nSheldon: I\u2019m sorry, we cannot do this without Wolowitz.\nLeonard: We can\u2019t order Chinese food without Wolowitz?\nSheldon: Let me walk you through it, our standard is, the steamed dumpling appetizer, General So\u2019s chicken, beef with broccoli, shrimp with lobster sauce and vegetable lo-main. Do you see the problem?\nLeonard: I see a problem. \nSheldon: Our entire order is predicated on four dumplings and four entrees divided among four people. \nLeonard: So, we\u2019ll just order three entrees.\nSheldon: Fine, what do you want to eliminate, and who gets the extra dumpling. \nRaj: We could cut it into thirds. \nSheldon: Then it is no longer a dumpling, once you cut it open it is at best a very small open faced sandwich. \nWaiter: Hi fellas. Oh, where\u2019s your annoying little friend who thinks he speaks Mandarin?\nSheldon: He\u2019s putting his needs ahead of the collective good. (Pointing at waiter) Where he comes from, that\u2019s punishable by death.\nWaiter: I come from Sacramento. \nLeonard: Can we get an order of dumplings, but with three instead of four.\nWaiter: No substitutions.\nLeonard: This isn\u2019t a substitution, it\u2019s a reduction. \nWaiter: Okay, no reductions.\nLeonard: Fine, bring us three orders of dumplings, that\u2019s twelve, we\u2019ll each have four. \nRaj: That works. \nSheldon: No, if we fill up on dumplings we\u2019ll need to eliminate another entree. \nWaiter: No eliminations. \nLeonard: If we have extra, we\u2019ll just take the leftovers home.\nSheldon: And divide it how, I\u2019m telling you we cannot do this without Wolowitz. \nLeonard: Wolowitz is with his new girlfriend, if you had let me invite Penny then you would have had your fourth.\nSheldon: Have you seen Penny eat Chinese food, she uses a fork, and she double dips her egg rolls. \nLeonard: We don\u2019t order egg rolls.\nSheldon: Exactly, but we\u2019d have to if she was here.\nRaj: Can we please make a decision, not only are there children starving in India, there\u2019s an Indian starving right here. \nLeonard: Here\u2019s an idea, why don\u2019t we just go out for Indian food.\nSheldon: No.\nRaj: Uurgh.\nWaiter: You are nice boys. Tell you what I\u2019m going to do. I\u2019m going to bring you the four dumplings. When I\u2019m walking over to the table, maybe I get bumped, one of the dumplings falls to the floor, no-one has to know. \nSheldon: I\u2019ll know. \nWaiter: (wanders away cursing in Mandarin.)\nRaj: How about soup?\nLeonard: Yeah, we can always divide soup.\nSheldon: What about the won-tons?\nScene: Outside Penny\u2019s door. Leonard knocks. \nPenny (answering): Oh, hey guys, what\u2019s up?\nSheldon: It\u2019s Halo night.\nPenny: Yeah. Okay. So?\nLeonard: Well, with Wolowitz spending all of his time with your friend Christie, \nPenny: She\u2019s not my friend. Friends do not get their friends care bears all sweaty. \nLeonard: Right, anyway, uh, with Wolowitz occupied elsewhere, we had something we wanted to ask you. Sheldon?\nSheldon: Yes. Penny, we would very much appreciate it if you would be the fourth member of our Halo team. I don\u2019t think I need to tell you what an honour this is. \nPenny: Oh, that\u2019s so sweet. But I\u2019m going out dancing with a girlfriend. \nSheldon: You can\u2019t go out, it\u2019s Halo night. \nPenny: Well, for Penny it\u2019s dancing night. \nSheldon: You go dancing every Wednesday.\nPenny: No.\nSheldon:\u00a0 Then it\u2019s not dancing night. \nPenny: Look, why don\u2019t I play with you guys tomorrow?\nSheldon: Tonight is Halo night, it\u2019s like talking to a wall. \nPenny: Alright, now Sheldon, you and I are about to have a problem. \nLeonard: Sheldon, remember, we role-played this.\nSheldon: Yes, but you didn\u2019t portray her as completely irrational.\nPenny: Alright fellas, I gotta go. Good luck. \nLeonard: Maybe we should have asked if we could go dancing with her and her girlfriend. \nSheldon: Okay, assuming we could dance, which we can\u2019t, there are three of us and two of them.\nLeonard: So?\nSheldon: It\u2019s the Chinese restaurant all over again. I assure you that cutting a dumpling in thirds is child\u2019s play compared with three men, each attempting to dance with 67% of a woman.\nLeonard: Aaah, for God\u2019s sake, Sheldon, you are driving me crazy. \nSheldon: Your anger\u2019s not with me, sir, but with basic mathematics.\nLeonard: No, I\u2019m pretty sure my anger\u2019s with you.\nRaj: What\u2019s happening to us? We\u2019re falling apart. \nLeonard: Who are you calling?\nSheldon: The only man who can restore any semblance of balance to our universe.\nHoward (voice): \u00a0Hi this is Howard Wolowitz.\nChristie (voice): And this is Christie Van Der Bell. \nHoward (voice): We can\u2019t get to the phone right now because we\u2019re having sex.\nChristie (voice): You\u2019re not going to put that on your message are you?\nHoward (voice): No, I\u2019m just kidding, I\u2019ll re-record it. (beep)\nScene: Outside Howard\u2019s house. \nLeonard: Sheldon, think this through, you\u2019re going to ask Howard to choose between sex and Halo.\nSheldon: No, I\u2019m going to ask him to choose between sex and Halo 3. As far as I know, sex has not been upgraded to include high-def graphics and enhanced weapon systems. \nLeonard: You\u2019re right, all sex has is nudity, orgasms and human contact. \nSheldon: My point.\nChristie (voice from within): I\u2019m just saying, you can take the damned plastic off the couch once in a while.\nHoward\u2019s Mother (voice): Why, so you and Howard can hump on it? \nHoward (voice): Ladies, ladies, I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a middle ground.\nChristie and Howard\u2019s Mother together: Shut up Howard. \nHoward (voice): You girl\u2019s talk, I\u2019m going to take my scooter out for a little spin. \nChristie (voice as Howard emerges through door): Are you happy, you drove your own son out of the house. \nHoward\u2019s Mother (voice): Why don\u2019t you stop butting in where you don\u2019t belong.\nHoward: What are you guys doing here? \nSheldon: It\u2019s Halo night. \nHoward\u2019s Mother (voice): He\u2019s not a man, he\u2019s a putz, and don\u2019t you take that tone with me, you gold digger.\nChristie (voice): What did you call me? \nHoward\u2019s Mother (voice): You heard me, and I\u2019ll tell you something else, you\u2019re barking up the wrong tree, cos as long as you\u2019re around, Howard is out of the will.\nChristie: (voice): You know what, I got better offers, I\u2019m out of here. \nHoward\u2019s Mother (voice): That\u2019s right, go back to Babylon, you whore. \nHoward: So, Halo night, huh? \nRaj: I thought she was the whore of Omaha?\nSheldon: Shhh! \nScene: The apartment, Halo night. \nHoward: Sheldon, you got him in your sights, fire, he\u2019s charging his plasma rifle. \nSheldon: I can\u2019t shoot now, I\u2019m cloaking.\nLeonard: Now, Raj, kill Sheldon.\nRaj: I can\u2019t see him.\nSheldon: That\u2019s why the call it cloaking, dead man.\nLeonard: Well then start throwing grenades.\nRaj: I\u2019m all out. \nPenny (entering with three other sexy women): Hi guys, my friends and I got tired of dancing, so we came over to have sex with you. \nLeonard: That will do, Raj, straight for the tank.\nSheldon: We said no tanks.\nRaj: There are no rules in hell! \nHoward: Son of a bitch, medpack, I need a medpack! \nPenny: Told yah! (They leave). \nLeonard: There\u2019s a sniper, use your rocket launcher. \nRaj: All I\u2019ve got is a needler, and I\u2019m all out of ammo. \nSheldon: And now you\u2019re out of life. Why did you hit pause?\nLeonard: I thought I heard something. \nRaj: What?\nLeonard: No, never mind, alright, go. \nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "3_22": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: Penny\u2019s apartment.\nPenny: Okay, Babydoll Pink, let\u2019s see if you can cover up the fact that I got my dad\u2019s feet.\nLeonard (voice off): It\u2019s just two degrees, Sheldon. I just want to turn up the thermostat two degrees!\nSheldon: (voice off): Let me point out that two degrees can be the difference between water and steam.\nLeonard (voice off): Yes, if we lived in a teakettle.\nSheldon: (voice off): This is the temperature you agreed to in the roommate agreement.\nLeonard (voice off): Aw, screw the roommate agreement!\nSheldon: (voice off): No, you don\u2019t screw the roommate agreement. The roommate agreement screws you.\nLeonard (voice off): You know what, go to Hell and set their thermostat.\nSheldon: (voice off): I don\u2019t have to go to Hell. At 73 degrees, I\u2019m there already!\nPenny (after a knock on the door): Who is it?\nLeonard: Leonard.\nPenny: Hang on.\nLeonard: Can I sleep on your couch tonight?\nPenny: Uh, well, you can try, but the people across the hall are being very noisy.\nLeonard: You heard that, huh?\nPenny: Apparently, the one fella tried to adjust the thermostat, then the other fella went bat-crap crazy.\nLeonard: So you agree, he\u2019s nuts.\nPenny: Well, not as nuts as the guy who chooses to live with him.\nLeonard: Believe it or not, he was worse when I met him.\nPenny: Oh, I do not believe that.\nLeonard: You are so naive. Just like I was seven years ago. (Flasback: The lobby) I\u2019d just started at the university.\nPast Leonard: Excuse me, I\u2019m looking for Sheldon Cooper\u2019s apartment.\nMan with a box: Oh, I bet you\u2019re here to check out the room for rent.\nPast Leonard: Yeah.\nMan: Run away, dude.\nPast Leonard: What?\nMan: Run fast, run far. (End of flashback.)\nLeonard: That should have been my first clue.\nScene: Moments later.\nPenny: So Sheldon\u2019s last roommate tried to warn you off?\nLeonard: For all I knew, he was the crazy one. He had this really deranged look.\nPenny: Well, yeah, he\u2019d been living with Sheldon.\nLeonard: Sure, it makes sense now. (Flashback. Past Leonard is getting out of the lift). Anyway, I went upstairs and knocked on the door.\nLarge Black Transvestite: Yeah?\nPast Leonard: Dr. Cooper?\nTransvestite: No, you want the crazy guy across the hall.\nLeonard: In retrospect, that was clue number two.\nPast Sheldon: Yes?\nPast Leonard: I\u2019m Leonard Hofstadter. I called you about the apartment. You said\u2026\nPast Sheldon: I know what I said. I know what you said. I know what my mother said on March 5, 1992. What is the sixth noble gas?\nPast Leonard: What?\nPast Sheldon: You said you\u2019re a scientist. What is the sixth noble gas?\nPast Leonard: Uh, radon?\nPast Sheldon: Are you asking me or telling me?\nPast Leonard: Telling you? Telling you.\nPast Sheldon: All right, next question. Kirk or Picard?\nPast Leonard: Oh, uh, well, that\u2019s tricky. Um, well, uh, Original Series over Next Generation, but Picard over Kirk.\nPast Sheldon: Correct. You\u2019ve passed the first barrier to roommate-hood. You may enter.\nPast Leonard (Enters apartment. It is bare except for two lawn chairs, a television and some whiteboards): Oh, this is pretty nice. Uh, the bedrooms are back there?\nPast Sheldon: That depends.\nPast Leonard: I don\u2019t understand, their, their existence is conditional?\nPast Sheldon: No, but your ability to perceive their existence is conditional on you passing the second and third barriers.\nPast Leonard: There\u2019s three?\nPast Sheldon: Each more daunting than the last. Have a seat.\nPast Leonard: Okay.\nPast Sheldon: No! That\u2019s where I sit!\nPast Leonard: What\u2019s the difference?\nPast Sheldon: This seat is ideally located both in relation to the heat source in the winter and a cross breeze in the summer. It also faces the television at a direct angle allowing me to immerse myself in entertainment or game play without being subjected to conversation. As a result, I\u2019ve placed it in a state of eternal dibs.\nPast Leonard: Can you do that?\nPast Sheldon: Cathedra mea, regulae meae. That\u2019s Latin for my chair, my rules. Now, you said on the phone that your area of study is physics.\nPast Leonard: Uh, yeah, experimental physics.\nPast Sheldon: Hmm.\nPast Leonard: What is that?\nPast Sheldon: Doesn\u2019t concern you. You\u2019ll be going to the university every day?\nPast Leonard: Yes.\nPast Sheldon: And you have a vehicle?\nPast Leonard: A car, yeah.\nPast Sheldon: And you\u2019ll be willing to drive me?\nPast Leonard: Well, can\u2019t you drive?\nPast Sheldon: I can. I choose not to.\nPast Leonard: Okay, I suppose I could drive you. Well that\u2019s a point in my favour, right?\nPast Sheldon: Why don\u2019t you let me do this.\nPast Leonard: Come on, I just asked.\nPast Sheldon: Last question. In a post-apocalyptic world, which task would you assign the highest priority? Locating a sustainable food source, re-establishing a functioning government, procreating, or preserving the knowledge of mankind?\nPast Leonard: Uh, I\u2019m gonna go with preserving the knowledge.\nPast Sheldon: That\u2019s correct. FYI, I would have accepted any answer other than procreating. Come, I\u2019ll show you the rest of the apartment.\nPast Leonard: Oh, good. I passed the barriers.\nPast Sheldon: The second barrier. Don\u2019t get cocky. This is the bathroom. Are you fairly regular?\nPast Leonard: Uh, I guess.\nPast Sheldon: This isn\u2019t going to work if you\u2019re guessing. When do you evacuate your bowels?\nPast Leonard: When I have to.\nPast Sheldon: When you have to? I\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t rent to hippies.\nPast Leonard: I, I\u2019m sorry, uh, in the morning. Around eight.\nPast Sheldon: I can\u2019t give you eight. I can give you seven thirty.\nPast Leonard: Fine. I\u2019ll take it.\nPast Sheldon: Third barrier passed. You have won the right to see your room. Huzzah!\nPast Leonard: Is this it?\nPast Sheldon: No, this is my room. People don\u2019t go in my room.\nPast Leonard: So where do you sleep?\nPast Sheldon: I don\u2019t understand.\nPast Leonard: If people don\u2019t go in there, and you\u2019re people, and\u2026 You are people, aren\u2019t you? Making a joke.\nPast Sheldon: Do you do this often?\nPast Leonard: On occasion.\nPast Sheldon: Your room. You may want to repaint. (End of Flashback)\nPenny: Okay, and after all that, you just moved in?\nLeonard: No, I didn\u2019t just move in. First we had to iron out a few details. (Flashback: The apartment)\nPast Sheldon: Roommates agree that Friday nights shall be reserved for watching Joss Whedon\u2019s brilliant new series Firefly.\nPast Leonard: Does that really need to be in the agreement?\nPast Sheldon: We might as well settle it now, it\u2019s going to be on for years. Initial here. All right, that\u2019s television and movies. Section nine, miscellany. The apartment\u2019s flag is a gold lion rampant on a field of azure.\nPast Leonard: We have a flag?\nPast Sheldon: Never fly it upside down unless the apartment\u2019s in distress. And next, if either of us ever invents time travel, we agree our first stop will be this meeting today in precisely five seconds.\nPast Leonard: Okay.\nPast Sheldon: Well that\u2019s disappointing. (End of flashback.)\nPenny: Why on earth did you agree to all that?\nLeonard: It was the best apartment I\u2019d seen, the rent was very reasonable and after you\u2019ve passed the first three barriers you kind of want to take it all the way.\nPenny: Well, I\u2019m sorry, Leonard, it\u2019s very hard to feel sympathy for you.\nLeonard: Okay, how about this? Let me tell you about the first time I brought a girl over. (Flashback to Leonard\u2019s bedroom.)\nPast Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard?\nPast Leonard: Shh. Just pretend we\u2019re not here.\nPast Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard?Leonard?\nPast Leonard: I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll go away.\nPast Sheldon: I\u2019m just going to keep knocking till you answer. (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard? (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard? (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard?\nPast Leonard: What do you want? I didn\u2019t say come in!\nPast Sheldon: You asked what I wanted. I wanted to come in. I\u2019m here because you violated our roommate agreement. Specifically, section eight, visitors, subsection C, females, paragraph four, coitus. Roommates shall give each other 12 hours notice of impending coitus.\u201d\nPast Leonard: I didn\u2019t even know her 12 hours ago.\nJoyce Kim: That\u2019s it! I\u2019m out of here!\nPast Leonard: But, Joyce, come on.\nPast Sheldon: 12 hours? (End of flashback.)\nPenny: Oh, my God.\nLeonard: Do I get some sympathy now?\nPenny: A little bit. Okay. Let me get this straight. You move in with this guy, he makes you sign a ridiculous roommate agreement, then he walks into your bedroom while you\u2019re doing this Joyce Kim, and you still stay?\nLeonard: Actually, I couldn\u2019t get too mad at him about Joyce Kim.\nPenny: Why not?\nLeonard: Well, I was doing some government research at the time, you know, military, rocket fuel. It\u2019s kind of secret.\nPenny: What does that have to do with Joyce Kim?\nLeonard: As it turns out, she was a North Korean spy. Luckily, Sheldon drove her out before I revealed anything important. Which I\u2019m not saying I would have.\nPenny: So, what, that\u2019s it? You\u2019ve stayed with Sheldon all this time because he kept you from going to federal prison?\nLeonard: That was part of it. The other part is what happened with the elevator.\nPenny: Oh, yeah, I\u2019m wondering about that. You said it was working when you moved in.\nLeonard: It was, but one night, Sheldon came home from work\u2026 (Flashback, the apartment. The settee has now appeared. Leonard, Howard and Raj are playing a video game.)\nPast Sheldon: What is going on here?\nPast Leonard: Hey, Sheldon. This is Howard and Raj. They work at the university, too.\nPast Howard: Hey.\nPast Raj: Hey.\nPast Sheldon: I\u2019ll get to you later. What are you sitting on?\nPast Howard: I can\u2019t speak for these guys, but I\u2019m sitting on my tushie. It\u2019s a joke.\nPast Leonard: Yeah, not a good idea.\nPast Raj: Tushie is buttocks, right?\nPast Howard: Right.\nPast Raj: Hilarious.\nPast Sheldon: Explain the couch.\nPast Leonard: Oh, well, there were some people on the first floor moving out, and they sold it to me for a hundred dollars. Howard and Raj helped me bring it up.\nPast Sheldon: But what\u2019s wrong with the furniture we have?\nPast Leonard: They\u2019re lawn chairs. And there was no place for company.\nPast Sheldon: Did it occur to you that was by design?\nPast Leonard: According to the roommate agreement, I\u2019m entitled to allocate 50% of the cubic footage of the common areas.\nPast Sheldon: But you didn\u2019t notify me by e-mail, so this is still a breach.\nPast Leonard: I did notify you.\nPast Sheldon: Oh, you did, did you? Oh, drat! Hoisted by my own spam filter.\nPast Leonard: What am I doing in your spam folder?\nPast Sheldon: I put you there after you forwarded me a picture of a cat playing the piano, entitled this is funny.\nPast Raj: Oh, yeah, I saw that. That was hilarious. (End of flashback.)\nPenny: Okay, what does all this have to do with the elevator?\nLeonard: I\u2019m getting to it. (Back to flashback.)\nPast Sheldon: I assure you, you\u2019ll be sorry you wasted your money on an iPod when Microsoft comes out with theirs.\nPast Raj: Okay, do you have an opinion about everything?\nPast Sheldon: Yes.\nPast Howard: And you just assume you\u2019re always right?\nPast Sheldon: It\u2019s not an assumption. Change seats with me.\nPast Raj: Why?\nPast Sheldon: I don\u2019t like this spot. I have to keep turning my head.\nPast Raj: Fine.\nPast Leonard: Ooh, it\u2019s time for Babylon 5!\nPast Sheldon: We don\u2019t watch Babylon 5 in this apartment.\nPast Leonard: Why not?\nPast Sheldon: Because no one likes Babylon 5.\nPast Leonard: I like it.\nPast Raj: Me, too.\nPast Howard: So do I.\nPast Leonard: There you go\u2013 three against one.\nPast Sheldon: They don\u2019t get a vote. It\u2019s one against one. And according to the roommate agreement, all ties will be settled by me.\nPast Leonard: But I said no to that.\nPast Sheldon: And I said yes. And I settle all ties. Change seats with me.\nPast Howard: Why?\nPast Sheldon: There\u2019s a draft on my neck over here.\nPast Howard: So, I get the draft?\nPast Sheldon: You\u2019re protected by your turtleneck.\nPast Howard: Fine. And it\u2019s a dickey.\nPast Sheldon: Hmm, I\u2019m still not comfortable. Of course. There\u2019s too many people here.\nPast Leonard: We can fix that. Let\u2019s leave.\nPast Howard: Yeah, we can go over to my place.\nPast Sheldon: Wait. Let me get my jacket.\nPast Howard: You\u2019re not going with us.\nPast Sheldon: Why not?\nPast Raj: You\u2019re the guy we\u2019re trying to get away from.\nPast Sheldon: Oh. Well, in that case, I don\u2019t need my jacket. And for the record, the correct syntax is I\u2019m the guy from whom you\u2019re trying to get away. Oh, yes, this is definitely going to be my spot. (End of flashback.)\nPenny: Okay, how do you know he said that? You left the room.\nLeonard: Hey, do you want me to finish working on your man feet or not?\nPenny: Fine. Go ahead. (Flashback to Howard\u2019s bedroom.)\nMrs Wolowitz: Howard, are you having a playdate?\nPast Howard: I don\u2019t have playdates! I have colleagues!\nMrs Wolowitz: Do their parents know they\u2019re here?\nPast Howard: No, but if you keep screaming, maybe they\u2019ll hear you!\nPast Leonard: That your dad?\nPast Howard: She grows any more hair on her face, yes.\nPast Leonard: Oh, man. Is that a two-stage rocket?\nPast Howard: Three. I designed the engine myself.\nPast Raj: Cool. Can it break Mach 1?\nPast Howard: Oh, probably, if I could get my hands on that new fuel the government\u2019s been working on.\nPast Leonard: Oh, this just might be your lucky day.\nMrs Wolowitz: Howard, what happened to the Oreos I left on the counter?!\nPast Howard: I haven\u2019t seen your Oreos! Just take your bath without them! (End of flashback.)\nPenny: So, why was it his lucky day?\nLeonard: Well, it turns out I had a little rocket fuel in the apartment.\nPenny: What were you doing with rocket fuel in your apartment?\nLeonard: Mm, Joyce Kim was kind of curious about what I did for a living, and I was going to kind of show it to her. It\u2019s not important. The point is, the guys and I went back to the apartment.\nPenny: Are we ever going to get to the elevator?\nLeonard: Yeah, we\u2019re really close. Uh, uh, we\u2019re at the apartment. (Flashback.)\nPast Leonard: The trick is to mix it into Tovex in order to create a combustible gel that will generate over 8,000 kilonewtons of thrust.\nPast Howard: Nice.\nPast Raj: Cool.\nPast Sheldon: Won\u2019t work.\nPast Leonard: Excuse me, but I\u2019ve been working on this a long time. Trust me, it\u2019ll work.\nPast Sheldon: You don\u2019t see your mistake, do you?\nPast Leonard: There\u2019s no mistake.\nPast Sheldon: This is for a full-scale rocket, not a model.\nPast Leonard: Well, I\u2019ve adjusted the formula.\nPast Sheldon: Not correctly.\nPast Leonard: Okay, I\u2019ve had it with you. You might be an expert on theoretical physics and science-fiction programs and where to sit on a freaking couch, but this is applied physics. And when it comes to applied physic\u2026 uh-oh.\nPast Howard: What\u2019s happening?\nPast Leonard: A bad thing. A very bad thing. Get the door. Get the door! Get the door! Get the door! Get the door!\nPast Howard: You\u2019re waiting for the elevator?\nPast Leonard: Oh. Right.\nPast Raj: Wait. It\u2019s here.\nPast Sheldon: Give me that. (Takes the rocket fuel. Puts it in elevator. Presses button and jumps out.)\nPast Leonard: What\u2019d you do that for? I had plenty of time. (Elevator explodes.)\nPast Sheldon: You\u2019re welcome. (End of flashback.)\nLeonard: Not only did Sheldon save my life, he didn\u2019t rat me out to the landlord. Or the police. Or Homeland Security.\nPenny: Okay, so, basically, you\u2019re the reason I have to walk up and down three flights of stairs every day?\nLeonard: So I did something stupid. I\u2019m sure you did stupid things when you were younger. What were you doing seven years ago?\nPenny: Excuse me, I was in high school. Studying, keeping my nose clean, doing volunteer work for the community. (Flashback. Penny is in her bedroom, sitting on the bed with a guy, looking at a pregnancy tester.)\nPast Penny: Not pregnant. Yes!\nScene: The apartment. \n \nSheldon: Oh, Ubuntu, you are my favourite Linux-based operating system.\nLeonard: Hey.\nSheldon: Hello. Why do I smell methacrylate?\nLeonard: Oh, uh, clear nail polish. I had a mani-pedi. Men can get those. Anyway, I may owe you an apology.\nSheldon: There\u2019s doubt?\nLeonard: I did agree to the thermostat setting, and I shouldn\u2019t have tried to change it.\nSheldon: That\u2019s not an apology, simply an acknowledgement that I was right.\nLeonard: Okay, I\u2019m sorry.\nSheldon: There you go.\nLeonard: So, we\u2019re good?\nSheldon: Good what?\nLeonard: Never mind. Okay if I watch some TV?\nSheldon: Go ahead.\nTelevision voice: Up next Babylon 5.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment.\n \nLeonard (voice off): You\u2019re not even watching!\nSheldon (voice off): I can hear it!\nLeonard (voice off): Oh, so the dialogue offends you?\nSheldon (voice off): I would hardly call that dialogue!\nLeonard (voice off): You\u2019re insane, you know that?!\nSheldon (voice off): Don\u2019t make me turn that flag upside down, \u2019cause you know I\u2019ll do it!\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "7_13": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The stairwell.\nSheldon: It\u2019s an outrage.\nLeonard: I know.\nSheldon: The university, they think they can do whatever they want. We just have to sit there and take it.\nLeonard: You need to let it go, Sheldon.\nSheldon: You work tirelessly for someone, and this is what you get.\nLeonard: Oh, my God, they\u2019re just making you use your vacation days.\nSheldon: But I don\u2019t want a vacation.\nLeonard: Okay, listen, I don\u2019t mean to diminish what you\u2019re going through, but I\u2019m a little distracted right now.\nSheldon: Oh, this again? So, Penny proposed, you didn\u2019t say yes, and now you think you may have lost her love forever. How does this compare to me being forced to relax for a few days?\nLeonard: It doesn\u2019t.\nSheldon: Thank you.\nLeonard: I\u2019m gonna go talk to Penny. \nSheldon: I\u2019m going to go inside, put on my coziest pajamas, curl up with a good book and wait for this nightmare to be over. (Leonard knocks three times) Penny. Sorry.\nPenny: Hi.\nLeonard: Hey.\nPenny: Look, I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t text you back. I just needed some time to think.\nLeonard: Okay.\nPenny: Yeah. Come in.\nLeonard: Look, if you want to break up, just say it.\nPenny: Leonard\u2026\nLeonard: No, no, no, no. I take it back. Don\u2019t say it. Just, just hate me, but stay with me. It worked for my parents.\nPenny: Listen, I don\u2019t want to break up with you.\nLeonard: Oh. Oh, okay. Good, good. So, it\u2019s cool if I cry a little?\nPenny: Yeah, I probably wouldn\u2019t.\nLeonard: Yeah.\nPenny: Look, you did the right thing last night. I was a mess. I was just frustrated because my career is going nowhere.\nLeonard: Look, I get it, and I want you to know that I support whatever you want to do.\nPenny: Great, because I\u2019ve been thinking, if I really want this acting thing to work, I need to focus all my energy on it. And to do that, I should quit waitressing at The Cheesecake Factory.\nLeonard: Wow. That, that\u2019s a big step.\nPenny: I know.\nLeonard: So, well, before making any rash\u2026\nPenny: I already quit.\nLeonard: And I support you.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Come on, take me to work with you.\nLeonard: No. You\u2019re on vacation.\nSheldon: Please. What if there\u2019s a big breakthrough in science today and I\u2019m not there to see it?\nLeonard: Do you really think there\u2019s gonna be a breakthrough without you there to do it?\nSheldon: No. I was just tricking you.\nLeonard: Bye.\nSheldon: Leonard, wait. Take me with you.\nLeonard: No.\nSheldon: Please.\nLeonard: No.\nSheldon: Too bad. I\u2019m coming with you.\nLeonard: Oh, Sheldon, stay.\nSheldon: But.\nLeonard: I said stay. I\u2019m going to work. Do not follow me. \nScene: The comic book store.\nBernadette: Hey Stuart.\nStuart: Hey.\nBernadette: Sorry. Did I startle you?\nStuart: Yes, but at this point, pretty much any customer does. What can I do for you?\nBernadette: Well, I need a little help. I accidentally destroyed one of Howard\u2019s comic books this morning, and was hoping I could replace it.\nStuart: Wow. What happened?\nBernadette: Batman got his ass kicked by my curling iron.\nStuart: Well, don\u2019t let The Riddler know that. It\u2019s a comic book joke. Or maybe it\u2019s not.\nBernadette: Do you have this one?\nStuart: Uh, well, it\u2019s, it\u2019s pretty rare. Can you give me a few days to track it down?\nBernadette: Ooh, I was kind of hoping to get it before Howie comes home from work.\nStuart: Oh. What\u2019s the hurry?\nBernadette: Well, he\u2019s always saying I should be more careful with my curling iron, and it seems like a dangerous precedent to let him think he can be right.\nStuart: Well, I\u2019ll do what I can, but I can\u2019t make any promises.\nBernadette: You know, I do work at a pharmaceutical company. If you can make this happen today, I can hook you up with anxiety medication, antidepressants. \nStuart: Really? Do you have any of these?\nScene: Amy\u2019s laboratory.\nAmy: Hello, Mr. Rat Brain. Not so bitey without the rest of the rat to back us up now, are we?\nHoward: Anybody home?\nAmy: Hey, what brings you guys here?\nRaj: Well, we were just on our way to lunch and wanted to see if you\u2019d like to join.\nAmy: Why? Because Sheldon\u2019s not here this week, and you don\u2019t think I have any other options? I\u2019m just kidding. I\u2019ll get my purse.\nBert: Hi, Amy. I, oh, I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t know you had any company.\nAmy: That\u2019s okay. Uh, Bert, this is Howard and Rajesh. Guys, this is Bert.\nHoward: Hi.\nRaj: Hey. Good to see you.\nBert: Anyway, I wanted to show you this tourmalinated quartzthat we got in the lab.\nAmy: This is so pretty. Bert works for the geology department.\nBert: Yeah. You know what, uh, geologists and Bon Jovi have in common?\nHoward: You\u2019re both into rock?\nBert: Yeah. Well, see ya.\nAmy: Oh, you forgot your quartz.\nBert: Oh, it\u2019s okay. I want you to have it. Bye.\nAmy: He\u2019s nice.\nHoward: Yeah, he\u2019s nice because he likes you.\nAmy: What?! No, he doesn\u2019t.\nRaj: He brought you a pretty rock.\nAmy: So? He does that every day. Oh.\nHoward: You know, if you\u2019d rather skip lunch and hang out with your boyfriend Bert, it\u2019s totally okay.\nAmy: He\u2019s not my boyfriend.\nRaj: Are you sure? He\u2019s tall, pale and awkward. That sounds like your type.\nAmy: Should someone as lonely as you really be making fun of me?\nRaj: Yeah, grow up, Howard. God.\nAmy: What do I do? I don\u2019t want to hurt his feelings.\nHoward: Maybe the problem is he thinks you\u2019re available. Does he know you\u2019re dating Sheldon?\nAmy: I guess it hasn\u2019t come up.\nHoward: There you go. \nRaj: And does Sheldon know you\u2019re dating Sheldon?\nAmy: I\u2019m sorry. Who are you dating?\nRaj: Yeah, knock it off, Howard.\nScene: The stairwell.\nPenny: Oh. Hey, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Hello.\nPenny: You okay?\nSheldon: I\u2019m on vacation. What do you think?\nPenny: Why are you sitting in the stairwell?\nSheldon: Leonard told me to stay.\nPenny: Oh. Well, good boy.\nSheldon: Where are you going?\nPenny: Oh, I have a ton of errands to run. I need to make copies of my headshot, send them off to agents and sign up for a new acting class.\nSheldon: Well, have fun.\nPenny: Okay. You want to come with me?\nSheldon: Really?\nPenny: Come on, boy. Come on. Let\u2019s go. Let\u2019s go. Get in the car. Come on.\nScene: The comic book store.\nStuart (on phone): All right, thanks a lot. They have one at Capital Comics.\nBernadette: Oh, that\u2019s great.\nStuart: No, it\u2019s not. I hate that place. Guy who owns it is a jerk. He\u2019s always making me feel bad about myself.\nBernadette: Oh, that\u2019s terrible. What\u2019s the address?\nStuart: You know, why don\u2019t I just take you there? That way, I can make sure he doesn\u2019t rip you off.\nBernadette: Oh, thanks, but I don\u2019twant you to close up. I mean, won\u2019t you lose business? Sorry. That was mean.\nScene: The cafeteria.\nAmy: Penny really quit The Cheesecake Factory?\nLeonard: Yeah.\nHoward: So, what is she doing today?\nLeonard: I don\u2019t know. She already thinks I don\u2019t support this, so if I call, it might look like I\u2019m checking up on her.\nRaj: Well, do you support this?\nLeonard: Of course I do. She\u2019s a great actress. I\u2019m proud she\u2019s taking this risk.\nAmy: That\u2019s nice.\nLeonard: You bought that? Great. I got to call her before I forget how I said it. Hey.\nPenny: Hi. What\u2019s up?\nLeonard: Oh, how\u2019s it going? You taking Hollywood by storm?\nPenny: Actually, I\u2019m at The Cheesecake Factory.\nLeonard: You got your job back. That is great news. I didn\u2019t want to say anything, but you are making the right choice. To plunge yourself into debt right now would be literally insane.\nPenny: Yeah. I\u2019m just returning my uniform.\nLeonard: And I support you.\nScene: Penny\u2019s car.\nVoice: Before we begin your guided meditation, close your eyes and picture yourself in a peaceful environment.\nSheldon: Okay. I\u2019m inside the CERN super collider.\nVoice: Now, take a deep, relaxing breath in through your nose. And let it out.\nSheldon: Wow. Didn\u2019t see that coming.\nVoice: In. \nSheldon: Let me guess.\nVoice: And out.\nSheldon: What was I gonna do? Two ins in a row? Where\u2019s my lemonade?\nPenny: I didn\u2019t get it.\nSheldon: A fitting swan song to your career as a waitress, to forget my order one last time.\nPenny: Do you think quitting my job was a mistake?\nSheldon: Do you see me drinking lemonade?\nPenny: No. I\u2019m serious.\nSheldon: Why do you ask?\nPenny: Because Leonard just pissed me off. Am I being an idiot or not?\nSheldon: No, I don\u2019t think you are. \nPenny: Really?\nSheldon: The best way to achieve a goal is to devote 100% of your time and energy to it. When I decided I was going to be a physicist, I didn\u2019t take some other job in case it didn\u2019t work out. Which wasn\u2019t easy because there was a lot of pressure from Ms. Pearson for me to be chalk monitor that year.\nPenny: Thank you. I needed to hear that. Why can\u2019t Leonard understand it?\nSheldon: Because he\u2019s not like us, Penny. We\u2019re dreamers.\nPenny: Yeah, I need to start cracking the window when I leave you in the car.\nScene: Amy\u2019s laboratory.\nBert: Hey.\nAmy: Hello, Bert.\nBert: So, anyway, there\u2019s this big, uh, rock and mineral show next week in Santa Monica.\nAmy: Listen, um, Bert, before you say anything else, I, I have a boyfriend.\nBert: Oh. This is awkward. You thought I was gonna ask you to go with me to the mineral show.\nAmy: Weren\u2019t you?\nBert: Yeah.\nAmy: That\u2019s very nice of you, but I do have a boyfriend.\nBert: That\u2019s what you all say. You just don\u2019t want to go out with me because I have an off-putting personality.\nAmy: No, that\u2019s not true. My boyfriend has an off-putting personality, too. Like, way worse than you.\nBert: Don\u2019t worry. I\u2019m used to it. I mean, I\u2019m big and weird and funny-looking and no one ever wants to do anything with me.\nAmy: Don\u2019t say that. \nBert: It\u2019s okay. I know I\u2019m a monster. \nAmy: No, Bert, come on. I\u2019d love to go to the mineral show with you.\nBert: Sweet. It\u2019s a date.\nAmy: No, it\u2019s not.\nBert: Too late.\nScene: Capital Comics.\nBernadette: Wow.\nStuart: Yeah. Haven\u2019t seen this many people in my store since that Korean church bus crashed through my front window.\nJesse: Hey, Stuart.\nStuart: Jesse.\nJesse: Haven\u2019t seen you in forever. Look how grey you\u2019ve gotten.\nStuart: My hair\u2019s exactly the same colour as always.\nJesse: No, I was talking about your skin.\nStuart: Look, uh, my friend here needs a comic book.\nJesse: Ooh, and she went into your store by mistake. Good thing there was no one there to see you. What do you need? Oh, yeah, yeah. I got this. Right over here.\nStuart: Even you, Sweatpants?\nSweatpants: Free popcorn.\nJesse: Can I offer you a coffee? Espresso? Latte?\nBernadette: No, thanks.\nJesse: How about you, Stu? Mocha? Scone? Directions to the nearest soup kitchen?\nBernadette: Hey.\nJesse: I\u2019m just kidding. He knows where the soup kitchen is.\nStuart: It\u2019s on Merton Avenue.\nBernadette: I don\u2019t think I like the way you\u2019re treating my friend.\nJesse: Sorry. You want the book or not?\nBernadette: Not from you. Let\u2019s go, Stuart.\nStuart: You know something, Jesse? You may have a successful business and the kind of pink complexion that comes with good nutrition, but I have something more important.\nJesse: What\u2019s that?\nStuart: Friendship. Which I would trade in a heartbeat for all of this.\nScene: Amy\u2019s laboratory.\nHoward: The mineral and rock show? That would be awful even without Bert.\nAmy: So what am I supposed to do now?\nRaj: Prepare your uterus for his gigantic offspring?\nAmy: This isn\u2019t funny. I\u2019m gonna have to tell him the truth, that even if I didn\u2019t have a boyfriend, I wouldn\u2019t be interested in him.\nHoward: Oh, I\u2019ve heard those words so many times. From Linda Nosenchuck, Tammy Rosenworcel.\nRaj: Padma Kapur, Neha Chowdury.\nHoward: Marci Grossman, Lisa Mazzarino.\nRaj: Megan Pincus.\nHoward: Tammy Cho.\nRaj: Oh, who was that girl from our Starbucks?\nHoward: Arlene Russel.\nRaj: Yes. Arlene. She wrote no way on both our cappuccinos.\nHoward: Poor Bert. That guy\u2019s got a rough afternoon ahead of him.\nAmy: Well, how would you want a girl to tell you she wasn\u2019t interested?\nRaj: I guess, uh, I\u2019d like her to sit me down, look me in the eye and say, I was wrong. I love you. And then maybe she could touch me in a special way.\nHoward: That\u2019s how you reject a guy.\nAmy: Okay, I don\u2019t have time for this. I\u2019m just gonna go find him and be brutally honest.\nHoward: No, don\u2019t.\nRaj: He\u2019ll be so upset. He\u2019ll probably climb up the Empire State Building and start swatting at planes.\nHoward: You want us to talk to him?\nAmy: Really? You would do that?\nRaj: Sure. We\u2019ve both been in his shoes. We\u2019ll let him down with compassion and respect.\nAmy: Thank you.\nHoward: Let\u2019s go.\nRaj: So we tell him she\u2019s a lesbian, right?\nHoward: Of course we tell him she\u2019s a lesbian.\nScene: The apartment. Penny and Sheldon are doing yoga.\nPenny: And hold three, two, one. Very good. Now let\u2019s try Warrior 2. And hold.\nSheldon: I\u2019ve read that there are great yogis who have such mastery over their bodies they can draw water in through their genitals.\nPenny: Yeah, well, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re gonna get to do that today.\nSheldon: Too bad. It seems like a good way to drink a milk shake without getting brain freeze.\nLeonard: Oh, hey.\nPenny: And now we go to Reverse Warrior.\nLeonard: How did she get you to do yoga?\nSheldon: Well, to be honest, I thought she said Yoda.\nPenny: I\u2019m helping him relax because, unlike you, he supports me.\nLeonard: Oh, how many times do I have to say it? I support you.\nPenny: Sheldon, take a break.\nSheldon: Namaste.\nPenny: Okay, if you support me, what was with that phone call?\nLeonard: Fine. I\u2019m not sure you should have quit. But if you care so much what I think, why didn\u2019t you ask me before you did it?\nPenny: Oh, so now I need your permission? Would you have asked me before you quit your job?\nLeonard: Yes. I thought we were in the kind of relationship where we make decisions together. If I\u2019m wrong, then maybe we need to talk about the kind of relationship we\u2019re actually in.\nPenny: Yeah, well, maybe we do.\nSheldon: I\u2019m willing to if you guys are.\nLeonard: Can we please have some privacy?\nSheldon: Y, No. I\u2019m as much a part of this relationship as you two, and I think it\u2019s high time we put all our cards on the table. For example, where is this going? Are you two ever getting married? And, if so, where will we all live? Have you thought about that?\nLeonard: No.\nSheldon: Penny?\nPenny: Okay, wait. What are we doing?\nLeonard: For some reason, we\u2019re planning a future where we both live with Sheldon forever.\nSheldon: Good. Now we\u2019re getting somewhere.\nPenny: Look, I know you think I\u2019m being reckless, and you might be right, but I need to take this shot.\nSheldon: Yeah, no kidding. Despite what it says on her r\u00e9sum\u00e9, she is no longer 22. \nLeonard: I swear, I am on your side. \nPenny: You keep saying you\u2019re on my side, but you don\u2019t act like it.\nSheldon: He does that to me, too. Why do we put up with it?\nLeonard: Listen, I could never do what you\u2019re doing, okay? I would be terrified.\nPenny: Well, it\u2019s scary for me, too.\nSheldon: I\u2019m fine with it.\nLeonard: My point is, just because I couldn\u2019t do it doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t. And I\u2019m proud of you. \nPenny: Okay. Thank you.\nSheldon: Well, to celebrate this reconciliation, let\u2019s all share a milk shake. Uh, Penny, you\u2019ll need a straw.\nScene: Capital Comics.\nJesse: You\u2019re back.\nBernadette: Yes, I am, there\u2019s a few more things I want to say to you. Stuart\u2019s store is just fine, and he\u2019s a much nicer person than you are, and if you still have that comic, I\u2019d like to buy it right now.\nJesse: No problem. Oh, you want a latte while you wait?\nBernadette: No, I don\u2019t want a latte. I want a cappuccino and a blueberry scone. \nJesse: I only have chocolate chip.\nBernadette: Well, that sounds even better.\nScene: Bert\u2019s car.\nBert: Thanks for coming to the mineral and rock show with me.\nRaj: We\u2019re sorry Amy didn\u2019t want to go.\nHoward: Really, really sorry.\nBert: Eh. Who needs her when I have you guys? Rock show! Rock show! Rock show! Rock show! Rock show! Rock show!

These are great. I just started number six.\nSheldon: That\u2019s a good one. Dumbledore dies in that one. Yeah, I know, I didn\u2019t see it coming, either.\nLeonard: Why would you say that?\nSheldon: You brought up the subject. I contributed an interesting fact on that subject. It\u2019s called the art of conversation. Okay, your turn.\nLeonard: That was a huge spoiler.\nSheldon: Good.\nLeonard: What is wrong with you? If I did that, you\u2019d bitch about it for weeks.\nSheldon: Oh, really, Leonard? Are you going to have another one of your hissy fits?\nLeonard: Hissy fits? I have hissy fits?\nSheldon: Yes, and I have a theory why. Because of your lactose intolerance, you switched over to soy milk. Soy contains estrogen-mimicking compounds. I think your morning Cocoa Puffs are turning you into a hysterical woman.\nLeonard: You are unbelievable. I don\u2019t know why I put up with you. You\u2019re controlling, you\u2019re irritating.\nSheldon: There you go again, nag, nag, nag. You\u2019re only proving my point, little lady.\nLeonard: You know what? Screw you, Sheldon. You are the most annoying person I have ever met.\nSheldon: What? I\u2019m annoying? You criticize my behaviour all the time. Sheldon, don\u2019t talk about your bowel movements over breakfast. Sheldon, when the president of the university is giving a eulogy at a funeral, don\u2019t yawn and point at your watch. Sheldon, don\u2019t throw away my shirts \u2019cause you think they\u2019re ugly. You\u2019re impossible.\nLeonard: That\u2019s it. I don\u2019t, I don\u2019t have to put up with this.\nSheldon: Actually, I have your signature on a roommate agreement that says you do.\nLeonard: Aw. Here\u2019s what I think of your roommate agreement.\nSheldon: You pick that up right now.\nLeonard: No.\nSheldon: Roommate agreement, section 27, paragraph 5, the roommate agreement, like the American flag, cannot touch the ground.\nLeonard: I don\u2019t care. I don\u2019t have to do anything you say because I don\u2019t think I want to live here anymore.\nSheldon: Where are you going?\nLeonard: To live with Penny and not you, you crazy bastard.\nSheldon: Crazy bastard?\nLeonard: Yes.\nSheldon: Leonard, wait.\nLeonard: What?\nSheldon: Dobby the elf dies in book seven.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s apartment.\nRaj: Here you go.\nHoward: Great. Come on in.\nRaj: What, you don\u2019t say thank you?\nHoward: It\u2019s my suitcase. I lent it to you two years ago.\nRaj: Well, then, I should tell you I broke the wheel and the handle. So, is everyone from Bernadette\u2019s company going to Vegas?\nHoward: No, just me, her and a couple of the big wigs. It\u2019s part of a bonus she got.\nRaj: Cool. Did she discover a cure for something?\nHoward: Not exactly. They spent a ton of money developing this dandruff medication that had the side effect of horrible anal leakage.\nRaj: Is there a good anal leakage?\nHoward: Anyway, it was Bernie\u2019s idea to rebrand the stuff as a cure for constipation.\nRaj: Way to make lemonade. You know, from around the corner where fudge is made.\nHoward: Hey, I got a favour to ask.\nRaj: Sure.\nHoward: My mom\u2019s been kind of an emotional wreck since that dentist she was dating dumped her.\nRaj: Dumped her? What, did he use a forklift? Sorry. There\u2019s nothing funny about morbid obesity.\nHoward: She\u2019s huge. It was funny. Anyway, I was just hoping that maybe you could check in on her tomorrow night and make sure she\u2019s doing okay.\nRaj: Dude, I\u2019m a single man. Saturday night is my party night.\nHoward: Really? What do you got going on?\nRaj: I don\u2019t know, maybe drive down to Hollywood, hit a few hot spots, see if I can get lucky.\nHoward: Yeah, tell me if this sounds familiar. You pay fifteen dollars to park, you stand on the pavement for an hour until you break down and give the bouncer twenty bucks to let you in. You push your way to the bar, where you drink an eighteen dollar cosmopolitan, then you stare at a pretty girl and imagine your perfect life together. Your children, grandchildren. Meanwhile, she leaves with a guy who claims he wrote Beverly Hills Chihuahua. Then you give up on anyone ever loving you, go to Marie Callender\u2019s, buy a pie and eat it in your car in the parking lot.\nRaj:What time should I be at your mother\u2019s?\nHoward: I told her around seven.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment.\nLeonard: I swear, that man is the most egotistical, insufferable human being I have ever met.\nPenny: Yeah, but you two make such a cute couple. Like Burt and Ernie. You guys even teach me stuff about words and numbers.\nLeonard: Well, I\u2019ve had it. I am done. I can\u2019t, I can\u2019t live with him for one more minute.\nPenny: Wow. Where are you going to go?\nLeonard: I was thinking here with you.\nPenny: Oh.\nLeonard: That a problem?\nPenny: No, not at all. No, it\u2019s, it\u2019s great. It\u2019s terrific. I, you know, I just can\u2019t help feel bad about Sheldon. I mean, how\u2019s he going to get by without you? Ernie.\nLeonard: He\u2019s got Amy now.\nPenny: Yeah, he does, but it\u2019s not the same.\nLeonard: Why?\nPenny: Um, well, um, all right. You, you know how in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Ron didn\u2019t abandon Harry just because Harry started dating Ron\u2019s sister?\nLeonard: Harry and Ginny get together?\nPenny: Sorry. Spoiler alert. My point is, as much as I want to live with you, I can\u2019t do it knowing how much Sheldon needs you.\nLeonard: Please, the only thing he needs me for is to be his whipping boy, his, his stooge, his doormat.\nPenny: Well, you know what they say, if it ain\u2019t broke.\nLeonard: Wow. It sounds to me like you don\u2019t want us to live together.\nPenny: No. No, no, I do. I do. It\u2019s just, I mean, it\u2019s a really big step.\nLeonard: Is it? We\u2019re together all the time. Financially, it makes great sense. Can you think of one reason why we shouldn\u2019t do this?\nPenny: Well, um, I\u2019m just a little thirsty.\nLeonard: Yeah.\nPenny: I got nothing.\nLeonard: Great. I\u2019ll go get my stuff.\nPenny: Yeah. Okay, all right, don\u2019t freak out. You can make this work.\nLeonard: Oh, could you clear off a shelf for me in the bathroom? I take a lot of medicine.\nPenny: Oh, please let some of it be Xanax.\nScene: Mrs Wolowitz\u2019s house.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Are you ready for dessert?\nRaj: No, thank you, Mrs. Wolowitz. As it is, I\u2019m going to have to carry my stomach out of here like I\u2019m a fireman rescuing an infant.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Oh, please. You\u2019re a tall glass of brown water. Have dessert.\nRaj: Well, I, I really couldn\u2019t. But, uh, I\u2019ve had a lovely time eating your brisket and hearing about the things you\u2019ve had removed from your body over the years. Didn\u2019t know you could have a cyst inside another cyst.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): The doctor said they were like Russian nesting dolls. Well, if you have to go, how about I put a little doggie bag together for you?\nRaj: That would be lovely. Thank you. (Sound of crying) Mrs. Wolowitz, uh, are you okay?\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Don\u2019t mind me. I just cry when I\u2019m lonely and have nothing to live for.\nRaj: I, uh, I suppose I could stay for some dessert.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Great. You like chocolate chip cheesecake?\nRaj: Sure.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): I\u2019ll make one.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: One vintage Mr. Mxyzptlk action figure. That\u2019s Leonard\u2019s.\nAmy: Children\u2019s toy.\nSheldon: One Star Trek: The Next Generation phaser. That\u2019s Leonard\u2019s.\nAmy: Children\u2019s toy.\nSheldon: One Game of Thrones collector\u2019s edition Longclaw sword. Oh, Leonard and I bought that together. That\u2019s a bit of an ethical conundrum. Eh, I\u2019ll keep it.\nAmy: So, uh, what\u2019s your plan moving forward?\nSheldon: Uh, suppose I\u2019ll have to find and cultivate a new roommate. What a task that will be. Do you know how uncivilized Leonard was when I took him in?\nAmy: No.\nSheldon: Oh, it took me forever to get him on a bathroom schedule. He would just go whenever the mood struck him.\nAmy: Like a dog-boy.\nSheldon: Exactly.\nAmy: What if you could find a roommate who was a scientist and already familiar and comfortable with your ways?\nSheldon: That would be ideal. If a person like that existed, I would sign on, no further questions asked.\nAmy: Great. Here I am!\nSheldon: Wait. Here who is where?\nAmy: Me. Aren\u2019t I your perfect roommate?\nSheldon: Um\u2026\nAmy: Think about it, Sheldon. I\u2019m not a stranger, we\u2019re intellectually compatible, I\u2019m willing to chauffeur you around town, and your personality quirks, which others find abhorrent or rage-inducing, I find cute as a button. What do you think?\nSheldon: Um\u2026\nAmy: Tell me one reason why this isn\u2019t a fantastic idea.\nSheldon: Um\u2026\nAmy: See? You can\u2019t. I\u2019m gonna go see if Leonard\u2019s room is big enough for my water bed.\nSheldon: Um\u2026\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment. \nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Good buddy Leonard. (Knock, knock, knock) Good buddy Leonard. (Knock, knock, knock) Good buddy Leonard.\nLeonard: What do you want?\nSheldon: Hey, good buddy. So, uh, I was just talking to Amy, and she made me realize that this little dust-up between you and me is much ado about nothing.\nLeonard: Is that so?\nSheldon: Yes. All is forgiven, so come back home. I\u2019ll make you some soy hot chocolate, and then I\u2019ll you tell you about our exciting new devil-may-care bathroom policy.\nLeonard: Cut to the chase, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Okay. Amy\u2019s decided she wants to move in with me, so I need you to come back home, you lovable scamp. That\u2019s a lot of product.\nPenny: Hey. What\u2019s going on?\nLeonard: Oh, get this, suddenly, Sheldon wants me back because Amy wants to move in with him.\nPenny: Really? Interesting.\nLeonard: Well, too late, pal. I\u2019m not going anywhere. Penny and I are very happy living together. Isn\u2019t that right?\nPenny: It\u2019s like the happiness won\u2019t ever leave the apartment.\nSheldon: Leonard, please. You know Amy moving in marks a level of intimacy our relationship isn\u2019t ready for.\nPenny: Yes. That is a real thing. And it doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t care about each other, it just means things are moving at a pace you\u2019re not comfortable with, and that\u2019s fine.\nLeonard: Well, if he doesn\u2019t want to live with her, then he should tell her how he feels.\nPenny: Well, maybe he doesn\u2019t know how to say it without hurting her feelings.\nSheldon: Feelings? What am I, a hippie at a love-in? No. The problem is, she laid out a series of logical arguments that I couldn\u2019t refute.\nPenny: That is the worst, isn\u2019t it?\nSheldon: Yes.\nLeonard: I\u2019m sorry, Sheldon. I can\u2019t help you. Oh, spoiler alert, this door\u2019s about to slam in your face.\nAmy: Oh, there you are. When do I get a key to our apartment?\nSheldon: Um\u2026\nScene: Howard\u2019s old bedroom. A phone is ringing.\nRaj: Hello?\nHoward: Hey. How\u2019d it go last night with my mom?\nRaj: Okay, I guess.\nHoward: What time did you leave?\nRaj: Actually, I\u2019m still here.\nHoward: What? You spent the night?\nRaj: Yeah. Uh, after dinner, we watched a rerun of Rockford Files, and then she opened a bottle of, uh, cream sherry, and the next thing I know, she was tucking me into your bed.\nHoward: You wore my pyjamas?\nRaj: Mm-hmm. How do you sleep in these things? Silk pajamas on satin sheets? I slid out of the bed, like, three times.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Rajesh! You up? You ready for breakfast?\nRaj: Oh, boy. Breakfast.\nHoward: Okay, Raj, listen to me. You need to get out of there.\nRaj: But I have a cream sherry hangover and I smell blintzes.\nHoward: If you don\u2019t leave now, she\u2019ll use food and guilt to keep you there for the rest of your life.\nRaj: Oh, Howard, stop.\nHoward: Trust me, you\u2019re not Jewish. That\u2019s how they get you.\nRaj: You\u2019re being silly. I can leave whenever I want.\nHoward: Oh, really? Where are your clothes and your shoes?\nRaj: They\u2019re on the chair, right over\u2026 Oy vey.\nScene: The stairwell.\nSheldon: Hello, home wrecker.\nPenny: What did I do?\nSheldon: You gave Leonard somewhere to go. Thanks to you, Amy\u2019s out buying his and hers bath towels. Like I\u2019d ever dry myself with something that has a possessive pronoun on it.\nPenny: Okay. Listen, the truth is I don\u2019t want him living with me.\nSheldon: Great. Kick him out. Break his heart. Everybody wins.\nPenny: No, I don\u2019t want to break his heart. I love him. This is just happening too fast.\nSheldon: You think this is fast? It\u2019s just a matter of time before I see Amy\u2019s leg stubble in my shower.\nPenny: Yeah, and I\u2019ve seen those legs. You might want to get some Drano.\nSheldon: Hold on. If you don\u2019t want to live with Leonard, why don\u2019t you just tell him?\nPenny: Well, you know how he is. He\u2019s sensitive and emotional.\nSheldon: That\u2019s because he drinks too much soy milk.\nPenny: Well, I don\u2019t know what else we can do but tell them the truth.\nSheldon: I suppose there\u2019s no choice but to face the crying, angry accusations and the high-pitched wails of despair.\nPenny: Yeah. And who knows how Amy will react.\nScene: A hotel room.\nHoward: Here\u2019s some more ice.\nBernadette: Oh, thanks.\nHoward: What were we thinking? We should have just done it the regular way.\nBernadette: Those Chinese acrobats in Cirque du Soleil made it look so easy.\nHoward: Honestly, if I could bend that far, what would I need with you?\nBernadette: If you could bend that far, you\u2019d be doing us both a favour. (Phone) \nHoward: Hey, Raj. What\u2019s up?\nRaj: You were right. I can\u2019t get out of here.\nHoward: You\u2019re still at my mother\u2019s?\nRaj: I\u2019m trapped. My clothes have been in the laundry all day, and she hid my keys. I think they might be in her bra, because she jingles when she walks. What do I do?\nHoward: Hey, you wanted a woman in your life. Now you got one.\nRaj: Come on, Howard, help me.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Rajesh, tatellah, I ran you a bath.\nRaj: Oh, my God. She\u2019s not gonna bathe me, is she?\nHoward: Gee, I wish I could tell you no. All right, well, thanks again for helping me out.\nRaj: But, Howard\u2026\nBernadette: Should we go back and rescue him?\nHoward: It\u2019s too late. We\u2019ll see him at his Bar Mitzvah.\nScene: The apartment.\nAmy: Here you go. I picked up the Chinese food just the way Leonard used to.\nSheldon: Is it kung pao chicken?\nAmy: Yes.\nSheldon: Brown rice, not white rice?\nAmy: Yes.\nSheldon: Spicy mustard from the Korean deli?\nAmy: Yes. I did good, right?\nSheldon: Yes. Amy, are you worried that us living together will take the mystery out of our relationship?\nAmy: No.\nSheldon: Yeah, why would you?\nAmy: Oh, and, uh, check this out. I took the liberty of scripting a new outgoing voice mail message for both of us.\nSheldon: Hello. This is Sheldon.\nAmy: And this is Amy.\nSheldon: We\u2019re not home right now.\nAmy: \u2018Cause we out dropping science, son.\nTogether: Leave a message.\nAmy: Beep.\nSheldon: You can\u2019t live here.\nAmy: What? Why? Is it the message? I only used urban slang to sound tough so people wouldn\u2019t break in.\nSheldon: No. It\u2019s not the message.\nAmy: Well, what is it, then? I did everything just the way you like it.\nSheldon: You did.\nAmy: Then what the hell, Sheldon? We have been going out for over two years, and I have been nothing but patient with you. I watch your dopey space movies. I signed your ridiculous contract. I even stopped wearing lip gloss \u2019cause you said it made my mouth look too slippery. I am the best girlfriend you\u2019re ever gonna have. You give me one good reason why I can\u2019t live here.\nSheldon: It\u2019s Penny\u2019s fault.\nAmy: What?\nSheldon: She doesn\u2019t want to live with Leonard, so he has to come live here again. She\u2019s the snake in our garden. She\u2019s the reason we can\u2019t be happy.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment.\nPenny: Hey, Ames.\nAmy: Yeah. Hey, Ames, nothing. I was all set to move in with Sheldon, and now I hear I can\u2019t \u2019cause you don\u2019t want to live with Leonard.\nLeonard (off): What?\nPenny: Sheldon, what did you say?\nSheldon: I said the truth. You don\u2019t want to live with Leonard, and you know it.\nLeonard: Since when don\u2019t you want to live with me?\nPenny: Oh, don\u2019t get all huffy. You\u2019re the one who decided to move in without even asking me if I was ready.\nSheldon: Yeah, I think we should talk about that.\nPenny: And since you love the truth so much, why don\u2019t you tell Amy you don\u2019t want to live with her instead of blaming it on me?\nSheldon: I thought we were talking about the other thing.\nAmy: You\u2019re a coward.\nSheldon: Well, the evidence does support that.\nPenny: Come on, Amy, let\u2019s go drink wine and talk about what jerks our boyfriends are.\nAmy: You know what would show them? I should move in here with you.\nPenny: Um\u2026\nSheldon: Do you want to catch up on some Walking Dead?\nLeonard: \u2018Kay.\nSheldon: Have you seen the one where Lori dies?\nLeonard: No.\nSheldon: Or maybe she doesn\u2019t. Let\u2019s find out.\nScene: Mrs Wolowitz\u2019s house. Raj is climbing out of the window.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Where you going?\nRaj (screams): No!\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "5_21": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The cafeteria.\nHoward: So, I got the craziest e-mail this morning.\nRaj: I don\u2019t mean to burst your bubble, dude, but those penile enlargement pills do not work.\nHoward: Believe me, I know. The e-mail I got was from the office of Stephen Hawking.\nLeonard: You\u2019re kidding.\nRaj: Why?\nHoward: He\u2019s coming to the university for a couple weeks to lecture, and he\u2019s looking for an engineer to help maintain the equipment on his wheelchair.\nLeonard: That\u2019s amazing. You\u2019ll be like his pit crew. A word of caution, I would not do your Stephen Hawking impression in front of him.\nHoward (in Stephen Hawking voice): You\u2019re right. I suppose that could be considered offensive.\nRaj: Oh, boy, Sheldon\u2019s going to freak out.\nLeonard: Yeah, he worships Hawking.\nHoward: I was actually thinking about bringing him along when I go over there so he can meet the great man.\nRaj: That\u2019s really nice of you, Howard.\nHoward: Hm, it\u2019s no big deal.\nLeonard: Boy, a restraining order from Stephen Hawking. It\u2019ll look so nice next to the ones he\u2019s already got from Leonard Nimoy, Carl Sagan and Stan Lee.\nSheldon: Leonard, do you recall when I said that I was going to revolutionize humanity\u2019s understanding of the Higgs boson particle, and you said, Sheldon, it\u2019s two a.m., get out of my bedroom?\nLeonard: Like it was ten hours ago. What about it?\nSheldon: Well, I believe I\u2019ve done it. And I\u2019m only saying believe to sound modest, because, sweet Sam Houston, I did it.\nLeonard: Really?\nRaj: That\u2019s incredible. Oh, here, break out the math.\nSheldon: Oh, okay, let me see this. All right, so this particle here is the boson moving forward in time. Now, I was thinking\u2026 Howard, you go ahead and eat. This isn\u2019t going to make any sense to you.\nHoward: Sheldon, I have a working understanding of physics.\nSheldon: Yeah, good for you, and don\u2019t stop working on it.\nRaj: Are you still going to tell him about you-know-who?\nHoward: Yep.\nLeonard: Still going to introduce him?\nHoward: Not on your life.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: A corridor.\nSheldon: Please, please, please let me meet Hawking.\nHoward: I told you, no.\nSheldon: But I said I\u2019m sorry.\nHoward: No, you said, would it help if I said I\u2019m sorry?\nSheldon: And you never answered me. So who owes whom an apology now?\nHoward: Sheldon, you\u2019re a condescending jerk. Why on earth would I want to do something nice for you?\nSheldon: Um, to go to Jewish heaven?\nHoward: Jews don\u2019t have heaven.\nSheldon: Then to avoid Jewish hell?\nHoward: Have you met my mother? I live in Jewish hell.\nSheldon: Howard, please. This is Stephen Hawking. Perhaps my only intellectual equal.\nHoward: Oh, you can\u2019t be serious.\nSheldon: Try to put yourself in my place. Imagine you\u2019re the sole human being living on a planet populated with nothing but dogs. And then it turns out there\u2019s another human being.\nHoward: Hang on. Are you saying the rest of us are dogs?\nSheldon: Yeah, okay, I can see you\u2019re going to take this the wrong way. Let me try again. Imagine you\u2019re the sole human being living on a planet populated with nothing but chimps.\nHoward: Get out of my lab.\nSheldon: Oh, now they\u2019re so much smarter than dogs. Have you seen them on those little bicycles?\nHoward: Get out.\nSheldon: How about dolphins?\nHoward: Out!\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: So, come on, how was the first day with Hawking?\nHoward: It was great. We talked about movies.\nSheldon: Oh!\nHoward: I showed him some card tricks.\nSheldon: Oh!\nHoward: He even let me read a couple pages from his new book.\nSheldon: Oh!\nHoward: Something got you down there, bunky?\nSheldon: Howard, please, I\u2019m begging you.\nLeonard: Raj, you\u2019re our group historian. Has Sheldon ever begged before?\nRaj: Three times. He begged the Fox network not to cancel Firefly. He begged the TNT network to cancel Babylon 5. And when he got food poisoning at the Rose Bowl Parade, he begged a deity he doesn\u2019t believe in to end his life quickly.\nSheldon: Do you understand how important Hawking is to me? When I was six years old, I dressed up as him for Halloween.\nHoward: You\u2019re kidding.\nSheldon: No, sir, no, I took my dad\u2019s desk chair, attached a Speak & Spell to it and made my sister push me up and down the block to trick or treat. Granted most people thought I was R2-D2, but still, I got a lot of candy.\nHoward: You don\u2019t seem to be understanding the English word no. Maybe a different language will help. Russian, nyet. Chinese, bu. Japanese, iie. Klingon, qo. Binary coded Ascii, 0110111001101111.\nSheldon: It\u2019s actually 01100111.\nHoward: No!\nSheldon: I\u2019m not asking for me, I\u2019m asking for Hawking.\nHoward: Let me try gansta, hells no.\nSheldon: Okay, look, how about this? Just give him my paper on the Higgs boson. If he sees the incredible breakthrough I\u2019ve made, he\u2019ll reach out to me.\nLeonard: What if he doesn\u2019t?\nSheldon: He will, he\u2019s really smart.\nHoward: That\u2019s an interesting idea. Why don\u2019t you give me a minute to talk it over with my friends?\nSheldon: How do I do that?\nHoward: You walk away.\nSheldon: Walking away.\nLeonard: You do realize you own his ass right now.\nHoward: I do.\nRaj: You can make him do anything you want.\nHoward: Yeah, I know, I\u2019m just trying to figure out how much I want to punish him.\nRaj: Well, don\u2019t be too mean.\nSheldon: Hey, fellas, I\u2019m thinking about making some freshly brewed iced tea if anyone would like some.\nRaj: I wouldn\u2019t mind a glass.\nSheldon: I wasn\u2019t talking to you.\nRaj: Bring him to his bony knees.\nHoward: Sheldon, come on back.\nSheldon: Yes, yes. What did you decide?\nHoward: I\u2019ll give your paper to Professor Hawking.\nSheldon: Great, thank you. Oh, that\u2019s terrific.\nHoward: But in exchange, I\u2019d like you to do a few things for me.\nSheldon: What kinds of things?\nHoward: Are you familiar with the 12 labours of Hercules?\nSheldon: Of course.\nHoward: You should be so lucky.\nScene: Howard\u2019s bedroom.\nSheldon: All right. What would you like me to do first?\nHoward: Well, I thought I\u2019d start you off by polishing my belt buckles.\nSheldon: Oh. By all means. When I was a boy, I would polish my Mee-Maw\u2019s silver. And she would entertain me with stories about growing up in Oklahoma. Interesting woman. You know, she once killed a prairie dog with a gravy boat.\nHoward: That\u2019s nice.\nSheldon: That\u2019s a lot of belt buckles.\nHoward: Funny thing is, I only have one belt. Anyway, I\u2019ll let you get started. Oh, by the way, the little marks, uh, that look like water spots, I tend to stand too close to the urinal, so what you\u2019re seeing there is splash back.\nSheldon: You make sissy on your belt buckles? Mee-Maw\u2019s forks never had that.\nHoward: Here is a black light to check them. And for your own peace of mind, you might not want to shine that around the rest of the room.\n(Later)\nHoward: Sheldon, these look great. They\u2019re like magnificent little crowns to hang over my magnificent little jewels. How\u2019d you get them so shiny?\nSheldon: Oh, I-I buffed them with Turtle Wax. The man down at Pep Boys says from now on, the urine should just bead up and roll right off.\nHoward: Way to go the extra mile. Your Mee-Maw would be proud.\nSheldon: My Mee-Maw must never know of this. Now will you give Professor Hawking my paper?\nHoward: Oh, my dear boy, no. Okay. Next, this is a sexy French maid costume I bought for Bernadette. I thought it might spice things up and get her to dust my room at the same time, but I was wrong and really wrong.\nSheldon: And you want me to return it for you?\nHoward: No, no, no, mon petit cherie.\nScene: The cafeteria. Sheldon enters in the French maid costume.\nSheldon: What are you all staring at? Didn\u2019t you ever see a man try to get a meeting with Stephen Hawking before?\nScene: The laundry room.\nPenny: Hey.\nSheldon: Hello.\nPenny: It\u2019s not Saturday night. Why are you doing your laundry?\nSheldon: This is not my laundry.\nPenny: Wow, are these Amy\u2019s? Kind of trashy, good for her.\nSheldon: Those are Howard\u2019s.\nPenny: Ugh. Why are you washing Howard\u2019s man panties?\nSheldon: Because if I don\u2019t, he won\u2019t give my paper to Stephen Hawking. He\u2019s a famous physicist.\nPenny: Yeah, yeah, I know, he\u2019s the wheelchair dude who invented time.\nSheldon: That\u2019s close enough.\nPenny: I don\u2019t understand, why doesn\u2019t Howard just introduce you to the guy?\nSheldon: Because he\u2019s punishing me for being a, quote, condescending jerk. You don\u2019t think I\u2019m condescending, do you?\nPenny: Well\u2026\nSheldon: Oh, I\u2019m sorry, condescending means\u2026\nPenny: I know what it means. And yes, you love correcting people and putting them down.\nSheldon: Au contraire. When I correct people I am raising them up. You should know, I do it for you more than anyone.\nPenny: Come on, you do it to feel superior. I see that twinkle in your eye when someone says who instead of whom or thinks the moon is a planet.\nSheldon: Or Don Quixote is a book about a donkey named Hotay.\nPenny: See, there it is, there\u2019s that twinkle.\nSheldon: Well, I can\u2019t help it. That\u2019s an involuntary twinkle.\nPenny: What do you want me to tell you, Sheldon?\nSheldon: I want you to tell me that Howard is being mean to me for no reason.\nPenny: Fine, Howard is being mean to you for no reason.\nSheldon: I knew it.\nScene: Howard\u2019s bedroom.\nHoward: What\u2019s the matter?\nBernadette: Every time I spend the night, your mom slaps me on the behind and says, go get \u2018im.\nHoward: It\u2019s not her fault. She\u2019s getting hormone replacement therapy. Makes her crazy horny. Check this out, I got Sheldon to wear the French maid\u2019s costume.\nBernadette: Oh, my God, that\u2019s terrible.\nHoward: Hey, I gave you first crack at it.\nBernadette: Why are you doing that? You\u2019re being mean to him.\nHoward: He\u2019s mean to me all the time. You\u2019ve heard him tease me about not having a doctorate.\nBernadette: If you don\u2019t want to get teased about that, get a doctorate. I have one, they\u2019re great.\nHoward: Oh, come on, the man torments me. I\u2019m just letting him have a little taste of his own medicine.\nBernadette: It\u2019s not the same thing. Sheldon doesn\u2019t know when he\u2019s being mean because the part of his brain that should know is getting a wedgie from the rest of his brain.\nHoward: Fine, I\u2019ll just make him do a couple more things, then I\u2019ll stop.\nBernadette: No, you have to stop now.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Bernadette, I want to remind you, you promised to take me dress shopping tomorrow!\nBernadette: Oh, damn. I\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t make it, but Sheldon\u2019s going to go with you! And that\u2019s the last thing you do to him.\nScene: A shop changing rooms.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Sheldon! I need your help!\nSheldon: What is it now, Mrs. Wolowitz?\nMrs Wolowitz (off): It\u2019s this dress. When I put my front in, my back pops out. When I put my back in, my front pops out. It\u2019s like trying to keep two dogs in a bathtub!\nSheldon: What do you want me to do?\nMrs Wolowitz (off): We\u2019re gonna have to work as a team. Get in here, grab a handful, and start stuffing.\nSheldon (off): I\u2019m not sure how to do this.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): It\u2019s easy, just pretend you\u2019re putting away a sleeping bag.\nSheldon (off): Sleeping bags don\u2019t usually sweat this much, but okay.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Now zip me up.\nSheldon (off): Oh, if we squeeze you any tighter, you may turn into a diamond.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): You\u2019re right, who am I kidding? You should have seen me when I was young, Sheldon. The fellas used to line up and bring me boxes of candy. Why did I eat it all? Would you hold me?\nSheldon: Oh, no, you know, I\u2019m not really the holding kind of\u2026 Oh!\nScene: The apartment.\nHoward: Oh, guys, I just remembered. I got you some Hawking souvenirs.\nLeonard: What are these?\nHoward: Gears and springs from his wheelchair. Pretty cool, huh?\nRaj: Wow, that\u2019s amazing.\nHoward: Yeah, I made an adjustment on the motor drive and when I was putting it back together I could not for the life of me figure out where they went.\nSheldon: I did it. Had to go to three clothing stores, but we finally found a dress that could envelop your mother.\nHoward: I should have sent you to the custom car cover place in Altadena. They have her pattern on file.\nSheldon: Humorous. Now will you please present my paper to Professor Hawking?\nHoward: I don\u2019t know.\nSheldon: Oh, for heaven\u2019s sake. I did your laundry, I pee-pee-proofed your belt buckles, I, I even sprained my wrist helping your mother lift her bosom.\nHoward: All right, Sheldon, there\u2019s only one thing left I want you to do. Don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s an easy one.\nSheldon: Okay.\nHoward: Give me a compliment.\nSheldon: Fine. You have very tiny hands.\nHoward: No, about my job. I want you to tell me I\u2019m good at what I do.\nSheldon: You\u2019re obviously good at what you do.\nHoward: Well, then why are you always ripping on me?\nSheldon: Oh, I understand the confusion. I have never said that you are not good at what you do. It\u2019s just that what you do is not worth doing.\nLeonard: It\u2019s nicer than anything he\u2019s ever said to me. I\u2019d take it and run.\nHoward: Thank you, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Now will you give my paper to Hawking?\nHoward: Sorry, I can\u2019t.\nSheldon: What, why not?\nHoward: I gave it to him three days ago. He was really impressed. He wants to meet you.\nSheldon: All right, then. Thank you, Howard. Please let Professor Hawking know that I\u2019m available at his earliest convenience.\nRaj: I thought he might be a little more excited.\nLeonard: Give it a second. (Sound of Sheldon shrieking in joy in his bedroom)\nScene: Stephen Hawking\u2019s office.\nSheldon: Professor Hawking, it\u2019s an honour and a privilege to meet you, sir.\nHawking: I know.\nSheldon: I want to thank you for taking time to see me.\nHawking: My pleasure. I enjoyed reading your paper very much. You clearly have a brilliant mind.\nSheldon: I know.\nHawking: Your thesis that the Higgs boson is a black hole accelerating backwards through time is fascinating.\nSheldon: Thank you. It just, it came to me one morning in the shower.\nHawking: That\u2019s nice. Too bad it\u2019s wrong.\nSheldon: What do you mean wrong?\nHawking: You made an arithmetic mistake on page two. It was quite the boner.\nSheldon: No, no, th-th-th-that can\u2019t be right. I-I don\u2019t make arithmetic mistakes.\nHawking: Are you saying I do?\nSheldon: Oh, no, no, no, of course not. It\u2019s just, I was thinking\u2026 Oh, gosh, golly, I made a boo-boo, and I gave it to Stephen Hawking.\nHawking: Great, another fainter.\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "7_17": "\n\t\t\t\tSceme: The apartment\nBernadette: Raj, your tag\u2019s sticking out.\nRaj: Thank you. That was the closest I\u2019ve come to sex in, like, two years.\nBernadette: Now I feel a little gross.\nRaj: You\u2019re only making it seem more real for me.\nHoward: Hey, that\u2019s my wife. If anyone\u2019s gonna make her feel gross about sex, it\u2019s me.\nRaj: Can we please talk about something other than my depressing love life?\nSheldon: How about Penny\u2019s depressing acting career?\nLeonard: Hey. I mean, it\u2019s been a little tough, but Penny\u2019s following her dreams, and in my book, that is not depressing.\nPenny: Aw, thank you.\nHoward: Is that book called Lies I Tell to Get Sex?\nRaj: Is that a real book? I would totally read that book.\nAmy: Can I borrow it when you\u2019re done?\nPenny: Well, I\u2019ll have you guys know I turned down a part in a movie last week.\nLeonard: Why would you do that?\nPenny: Because it was crap. It\u2019s a sequel to that awful killer gorilla movie I was in.\nBernadette: Serial Ape-ist? I thought you died in that.\nSheldon: She does. 42 minutes in.\nRaj: While showering topless, 16 minutes after brief side butt during a pillow fight with her sorority sisters.\nSheldon: I have an eidetic memory. I don\u2019t know what his problem is.\nPenny: Okay, well, there are no shower scenes in this one. They just try to clone me from my corpse, but my DNA gets mixed with the ape\u2019s DNA and I end up running around with giant gorilla hands and feet.\nSheldon: Am I missing something, or isn\u2019t that the part she was born to play?\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: So are you really not gonna do this movie?\nPenny: Well, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the kind of part that\u2019s good for my career.\nLeonard: Well, but don\u2019t a lot of famous actors get their start doing bad movies?\nPenny: Okay, I don\u2019t think Meryl Streep ever had to say \u201cMust keep gorilla hands from killing again!\u201d\nRaj: If she did, it would be amazing. That woman can do no wrong.\nLeonard: I don\u2019t know anything about show business, so if you think it\u2019s reasonable to turn down paid work and just burn through your savings, I\u2019m sure you know what you\u2019re doing.\nAmy: I think we\u2019re gonna go.\nSheldon: Are you sure? We were making fun of failed careers. We didn\u2019t get to tap the juicy vein that is Howard\u2019s.\nHoward: Hey, I work at the same university you do.\nSheldon: Yes, and Hawkeye\u2019s in the Avengers, but no one ever says help, Hawkeye.\nBernadette: Can I ask you something? Why do you constantly feel the need to put down my husband?\nPenny: Oh, I\u2019m sure he does it out of love. The same way my boyfriend makes me feel terrible about my life choices.\nAmy: I think we\u2019re gonna go.\nLeonard: No, no, no. This is not a fight. I was just excited that someone offered you a part and a little surprised that you\u2019d rather sit at home and do nothing than take it. Now it\u2019s a fight.\nSheldon: Well, with that sorted out, I\u2019m happy to answer your question, Bernadette. Howard started it.\nHoward: I didn\u2019t do anything. I was just sitting here.\nSheldon: I wasn\u2019t referring to this evening. Ten years ago, upon first seeing me, your husband claimed that I looked like C-3PO and Pee-wee Herman. And he called me C-3P-wee Herman.\nRaj: Ha-a-a. Still funny.\nBernadette: That was ten years ago.\nSheldon: Nine years, 11 months and three weeks ago, he followed that up by replacing the slides for my lecture with photographs of nude fat women bending over.\nAmy: Really?\nHoward: The lecture was on cosmic gas clouds. That\u2019s funny.\nRaj: I was there. It was funny.\nSheldon: In any event, that began a decade-long progression of insults, pranks and unwanted magazine subscriptions. To this day, I still get a monthly copy of Granny on Granny. Which, other than its surprisingly fun puzzle page, is complete filth.\nScene: The street\nAmy: Thanks for walking me to my car.\nRaj: Actually, it\u2019s for both of us. Last night, I watched West Side Story, and I\u2019m a little freaked out by street gangs.\nAmy: Why can\u2019t Raj find a girl? The mystery continues.\nRaj: I don\u2019t appreciate your sarcasm, but we\u2019ve still got two blocks to go, so I\u2019ll put up with it.\nAmy: Whatever happened with your online dating?\nRaj: No one was writing me back, so I stopped checking my profile.\nAmy: Before I met Sheldon, I was ready to give up, too. Once, I even dropped in on my OBGYN just to get some human contact.\nRaj: It has been a while since I got my prostate checked.\nAmy: Then I met Sheldon and look at where we are now.\nRaj: What? You\u2019ve kissed, like, once in three years.\nAmy: That\u2019s true. Do whatever you want.\nScene: Sheldon\u2019s office.\nHoward: Hey.\nSheldon: Hello.\nHoward: Listen, I was thinking you and I could probably try to be better friends.\nSheldon: Really? I was thinking what we have now is a bit much.\nHoward: Seriously, I was talking to Bernadette last night and she made some great points. You and I have known each other a long time, and I didn\u2019t hear the rest \u2019cause she took her bra off.\nSheldon: Very well. How do you propose we move forward?\nHoward: Uh, for starters, we could stop insulting each other.\nSheldon: That\u2019s a great idea. And in the spirit of our new arrangement, I will mask my surprise that you came up with it.\nHoward: Anyway, I got invited to do a little talk at NASA in Houston this weekend. They gave me two tickets. Bernadette can\u2019t go. You want to come with me? You can visit your mom, and I\u2019ll show you around the space centre.\nSheldon: I have one question. Is this a prank where we land in Houston and you\u2019ve made up wanted posters that have my face with a moustache and a Spanish name and then I get arrested and deported to South America?\nHoward: No.\nSheldon: I\u2019m glad because I would not have seen that coming.\nScene: Amy\u2019s lab.\nRaj: Amy, I could use some help.\nAmy: Oh. Let me guess. There\u2019s an undergrad in a leather jacket snapping his fingers by the water fountain.\nRaj: I thought about what you said last night, and I went back on the dating Web site and I was looking at this girl\u2019s profile. She\u2019s amazing.\nAmy: Oh, she\u2019s cute. And smart. Phi Beta Kappa.\nRaj: And judging by her lack of Adam\u2019s apple, she\u2019s been female her entire life. I like that in a woman.\nAmy: Great, so what do you need me for?\nRaj: Well, I was up all night trying to write to her, but I wanted to run it by you first.\nAmy: All right.\nRaj: Emily, your face is like a precious dew-kissed flower.\nAmy: Wow.\nRaj: I know. Powerful stuff, huh?\nAmy: No. You\u2019re supposed to be yourself, not all desperate and creepy.\nRaj: Okay, I\u2019m getting some mixed messages here.\nAmy: Just say something normal like, I saw your profile. Looks like we have a lot in common, let\u2019s get a cup of coffee sometime.\u201d\nRaj: Yes. Where I can be jealous of the cup touching your ruby lips. Or you just write it for me.\nAmy: I\u2019m not gonna pretend to be you.\nRaj: I don\u2019t want you to pretend to be me. You can be like my, uh, online wingman. Like if we met her at a bar and you talked me up.\nAmy: Well, what would I say to her?\nRaj: Just tell her what I\u2019m really like. And, if you think it\u2019ll help, that you saw me changing once and my package reminded you of the muscular tail of a jaguar. Use your own words.\nScene: Penny\u2019s car.\nSheldon: Thanks again for taking me to the pharmacy.\nPenny: Oh, it\u2019s no problem. Is everything okay?\nSheldon: Oh, I\u2019m fine. It\u2019s just some, uh, stomach medication for my trip. There\u2019s the remote yet distinct possibility that I may end up in South America.\nPenny: Remember the old days when I would\u2019ve said something dumb like why? Uh, that doesn\u2019t sound good.\nSheldon: Remember the old days when I used to point out that your check engine light was on?\nPenny: Yes.\nSheldon: Well, get ready to stroll down memory lane. Penny, your check engine\u2026\nPenny: Yeah, I know it\u2019s on, Sheldon. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I cannot afford this right now.\nSheldon: Maybe it\u2019s just something minor. Ooh, good news, the light just went out.\nScene: The apartment. \nLeonard: Are we playing individual or teams?\nRaj: Teams are fun.\nSheldon: Oh, in that case, I\u2019d like to be partnered with my good friend Howard.\nRaj: But I\u2019m always on Howard\u2019s team. We\u2019re best friends. The kind who finish each others\u2026\nHoward: I really don\u2019t think we do tha\u2026\nRaj: Do that. See?\nPenny: Oh, hi.\nLeonard: Oh, how\u2019d it go at the mechanic?\nPenny: Not great. Can I talk to you for a sec?\nLeonard: Yeah, sure.\nRaj: Maybe I can go with you guys to Houston?\nHoward: Isn\u2019t it a little late to get plane tick\u2026\nRaj: Plane tickets? Yeah.\nHoward: Will you please sto\u2026\nRaj: Stop that? Okay.\nScene: The stairwell.\nPenny: I don\u2019t know what to do. My car threw a rod and it\u2019s totaled. I can\u2019t afford a new one, I have no job, and now I can\u2019t drive to auditions.\nLeonard: I\u2019m so sorry. I know it\u2019s a sensitive subject, but can you reconsider that part in the movie?\nPenny: I did. I called them. The part\u2019s gone. They gave it to someone else. Now that girl\u2019s gonna get discovered and become famous and go on Letterman and talk about how she got her big break on a cheap monkey movie all because some dumb girl thought it was beneath her.\nLeonard: At least they talked about you on Letterman. Come on, I can drive you wherever you need to go.\nPenny: How? Unlike me, you have a job. I\u2019m just gonna have to go back to being a waitress, like I will be for the rest of my life.\nSheldon: Leonard, would you wrap it up? We\u2019re waiting on you.\nPenny: I\u2019m sorry, is the fact that my life\u2019s falling apart interfering with your board game?\nSheldon: It is. You were wrong, friend Howard. She completely understood.\nScene: Amy\u2019s lab.\nRaj: Hey, you busy?\nAmy: No. What\u2019s up?\nRaj: Have you heard back from Emily?\nAmy: I have.\nRaj: Great. And?\nAmy: And I\u2019m afraid she doesn\u2019t think you\u2019re right for her.\nRaj: I give you one simple thing to do, contact a complete stranger and make her fall in love with me, and you blow it.\nAmy: I told her what a good guy you are, but she thought it was a bad sign that you didn\u2019t write to her yourself. She thought it made you seem too shy and passive.\nRaj: I\u2019m not too shy and passive. You write her back and tell her I said that. You know, when you have a second.\nAmy: Look, I\u2019ll see if I can change her mind tomorrow night.\nRaj: What\u2019s happening tomorrow night?\nAmy: I\u2019m meeting her for coffee.\nRaj: What?\nAmy: Well, we just, we e-mailed back and forth a bit, and we kind of hit it off.\nRaj: I find a girl I like, and you\u2019re stealing her?\nAmy: No. We just ended up having a lot in common. We went to Harvard, we like Chaucer, we\u2019re both hardcore into quilting.\nRaj: Your words fall like acid rain on the wounded petals of my heart.\nScene: Bernadette\u2019s car.\nHoward: That\u2019s Sheldon. He says he\u2019ll be down in a minute.\nBernadette: What are you doing?\nHoward: Oh, he\u2019s not coming out until he sees proof you don\u2019t have an air freshener in your car.\nBernadette: This is gonna be a long weekend for you.\nHoward: You\u2019re the reason I\u2019m doing it.\nBernadette: I said to stop insulting each other. I didn\u2019t tell you to take him on a romantic getaway.\nHoward: How do I know what you said? Damn you and your noise-cancelling breasts.\nSheldon: Hello.\nBernadette: Hi.\nHoward: Hey, buddy.\nBernadette: You excited for Texas?\nSheldon: Oh, very much so.\nHoward: It\u2019s not every day you get to tour NASA with a real astronaut.\nSheldon: Oh, who\u2019s the real astronaut?\nHoward: Buzz Aldrin.\nSheldon: Oh. Yay.\nScene: An airplane. \nSheldon: (Tap, tap, tap) Howard? (Tap, tap, tap) Howard? (Tap, tap, tap) Howard?\nHoward: What now?\nSheldon: I have to go to the bathroom.\nHoward: You just went to the bathroom.\nSheldon: But I didn\u2019t use it because it didn\u2019t seem safe. Despite all my e-mails, the toilet didn\u2019t have a seatbelt.\nHoward: Well, it still doesn\u2019t.\nSheldon: I realize that, but safety concerns went out the window two apple juices ago.\nHoward: Fine.\nSheldon: Why are you getting annoyed?\nHoward: I\u2019m trying to be a better friend, but you constantly say and do irritating things.\nSheldon: Like when?\nHoward: When? How about in the car? I\u2019m an astronaut, and you know it. You just don\u2019t like admitting it, because you\u2019re jealous.\nSheldon: Well, truth be told, as a child, I did dream of going to space. Those astronauts were my heroes. And when you got to go, it was hard for me.\nHoward: Thank you.\nSheldon: Because it made me realize they\u2019ll just send anyone up there. Aren\u2019t you going to let me out?\nHoward: No.\nSheldon: But I still need to use the bathroom.\nHoward: Here you go. Be creative. What\u2019s the matter? Scared of a little turbulence?\nSheldon: No, turbulence is just the equalization of diurnal temperature variations in the atmosphere. I\u2019m not scared at all. Oh, apple juice, stay where you are.\nHoward: Oh, this is nothing. I experienced way worse when I was plummeting back to Earth, apparently not being a real astronaut. Okay, that was a big one.\nSheldon: I take it back. I\u2019m scared of turbulence!\nHoward: I\u2019m gonna need that bag back.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment. \nLeonard: You sure you want to do this?\nPenny: Yeah. Why wouldn\u2019t I want to get my old job back? It\u2019ll be fun to see everyone. I haven\u2019t talked to them since I said I quit, see you at the Oscars, bitches. Come on, let\u2019s just get this over with.\nLeonard: Let\u2019s get this over with. Am I driving you to the Cheesecake Factory, or are we having sex? I\u2019m just, I\u2019m trying to lighten the mood.\nPenny: I know. Thank you.\nLeonard: Sorry.\nPenny: It\u2019s just so humiliating.\nLeonard: So humiliating? Am I driving you to the Cheesecake Factory\u2026? I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ll. I\u2019ll stop. I\u2019ll stop.\nScene: Outside the building. \nLeonard: Come on, don\u2019t look so sad. You never know what\u2019s gonna happen. Maybe tonight will be great.\nPenny: Sweetie, I know you\u2019re trying to make me feel better, and I love you for that, but it\u2019s making me feel worse, and I kind of hate you. This isn\u2019t your car.\nLeonard: I know. I thought we\u2019d take yours.\nPenny: I don\u2019t understand.\nLeonard: It\u2019s nothing fancy, but it\u2019ll get you to auditions, and at least for now, you don\u2019t have to go back to waitressing.\nPenny: I don\u2019t know what to say.\nLeonard: Don\u2019t say anything.\nPenny: Oh, my God.\nLeonard: I mean, you could say thank you. I did just buy you a car.\nScene: A coffee shop.\nAmy: Look, I admit that it\u2019s odd that Rajesh didn\u2019t write to you himself, but if you get to know him, you\u2019ll see he\u2019s just a sweet, regular guy. As a counterpoint, here he is, uninvited and visibly sweaty.\nRaj: Hello, Emily.\nEmily: Hello.\nRaj: Amy told me you were concerned that I might be too passive and shy. Let me ask you something. Would a passive guy barge in here to look you in the eye and say, hey, dew-kissed flower, what\u2019s up?\nEmily: No, but a weird guy with no boundaries might.\nRaj: Uh, okay, that\u2019s a separate issue. Let\u2019s put a pin in that and just focus on the passive thing.\nEmily: I\u2019m leaving.\nAmy: Are we still going to go to that Chaucer reading Friday?\nEmily: You know, I think I\u2019m just gonna go by myself.\nRaj: Not my best first date. Yeah, but not my worst, either.\nScene: The airplane.\nSheldon: I\u2019m sorry for every mean thing I ever did or said to you.\nHoward: I\u2019m sorry, too. It\u2019s all my fault.\nSheldon: If you weren\u2019t my friend, there\u2019d be a hole in my life.\nHoward: Thank you, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Kind of like when Firefly was cancelled. But not as big.\nAnnouncement: The captain has turned off the fasten seat belt sign. You\u2019re now free to move about the cabin.\nHoward: It\u2019s over.\nSheldon: Yeah.\nHoward: Should we stop holding hands now?\nSheldon: In a minute.\nHoward: Okay, good.\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "2_5": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The apartment.

Sheldon enters from the bedroom area.\nSheldon: Good morning, Leonard.\nLeonard: Uh-huh.\nSheldon: Yeah, we\u2019re going to have to stop by Pottery Barn on the way to work, I bought these Star Wars sheets but they turned out to be much too stimulating to be compatible with a good night\u2019s sleep. I don\u2019t like the way Darth Vader stares at me.\nLeonard: I\u2019m not going to work.\nSheldon: Oh, just because your career\u2019s been stagnant for a few years, that\u2019s no reason to give up.\nLeonard: Sheldon, I was up all night using the new free-electron laser for my X-ray diffraction experiment.\nSheldon: Did the laser accidentally burn out your retinas?\nLeonard: No.\nSheldon: Then you can drive. Let\u2019s go.\nLeonard: Didn\u2019t I tell you I\u2019d be working nights, and that you\u2019d have to make other arrangements.\nSheldon: You did.\nLeonard: And?\nSheldon: I didn\u2019t. Let\u2019s go.\nLeonard: Goodnight, Sheldon.\nSheldon: But how am I going to get to work?\nLeonard: Take the bus.\nSheldon: I can\u2019t take the bus any more. They don\u2019t have seatbelts. And they won\u2019t let you lash yourself to the seat with bungee cords.\nLeonard: You tried to lash yourself to the seat with bungee cords?\nSheldon: I didn\u2019t try, I succeeded. For some reason it alarmed the other passengers and I was asked to de-bus.\nLeonard: Oh, you\u2019re a big boy, you\u2019ll figure it out.\nSheldon: Don\u2019t talk to me like I\u2019m a child.

Didn\u2019t you recently state that you and I are friends?\nPenny: Yes, Sheldon, we are friends.\nSheldon: Then I hereby invoke what I\u2019m given to understand is an integral part of the implied covenant of friendship.

I\u2019m not keeping you from anything. Your check engine light is on.\nPenny: Mm-hmm.\nSheldon: Typically that\u2019s an indicator. To, you know, check your engine.\nPenny: It\u2019s fine, it\u2019s been on for, like, a month.\nSheldon: Well, actually, that would be all the more reason to, you know, check your engine.\nPenny: Sheldon, it\u2019s fine.\nSheldon: If it were fine, the light wouldn\u2019t be on. That\u2019s why the manufacturer installed that light, to let you know it\u2019s not fine.\nPenny: Uh, maybe the light\u2019s broken.\nSheldon: Is there a \u201ccheck the check engine light light\u201d? (Penny takes a drink of coffee) O-o-o-oh!\nPenny: What?\nSheldon: Studies have shown that performing tasks such as eating, talking on a cell phone or drinking coffee while driving reduces one\u2019s reaction time by the same factor as an ounce of alcohol.\nPenny: Do you have any alcohol?\nSheldon: Of course not.\nPenny: Too bad.\nSheldon: You\u2019re going up Euclid Avenue?\nPenny: Mm-hmm.\nSheldon: Leonard takes Los Robles Avenue.\nPenny: Well, good for Leonard.\nSheldon: Euclid Avenue is shorter as the crow flies, but it has speed bumps, which appreciably increase point-to-point drive time, making it the less efficient choice. But you have the conn. Of course, if you\u2019re not going to slow down for the speed bumps, I withdraw my previous objection. Here\u2019s a fun question. Do you know what the most common street name is?\nPenny: No.\nSheldon: The answer\u2019s tricky. It\u2019s Second Street. You see, you\u2019d think it would be First Street, but in most towns, First Street eventually gets renamed to something else, you know, like Main Street, Broad Street, Michigan Avenue. Leonard and I often use our commute time to exercise our minds\u00a0 with brain-teasers like that. We also play games. Would you like to play one?\nPenny: No.\nSheldon: Oh, come on, it\u2019s fun. Ooh! Another bump. Okay. I\u2019ll say an element, and uh, you say an element whose name starts with the last letter of the one I said, okay? I\u2019ll start. Helium. Now, you could say Mercury. That would give me a Y. Ooh. \u00a0Very clever, that\u2019s a tough one. So I go Ytterbium, which gets you back to M. So you go Molybdenum, and I say Magnesium, you say Manganese, and\u00a0 I say Europium, and, and you\u2019re left with Mendelevium, and \u00a0there are no more M\u2019s because I believe that Meitnerium should still be called Ekairidium, so congratulations, you win. Do you wanna go again?\nPenny: How about we just have a little quiet time now?\nSheldon: All right. Hmm, huh, I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m finding your reckless nonchalance regarding the check-engine light to be very troubling.\nPenny (Pulling over): Get out.\nSheldon: Well, I have to tell you that while I do have a theoretical understanding of the workings of an internal combustion engine, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m capable of performing diagnostics.\nPenny: I said, get out.\nSheldon: Okay. I\u2019ll give it a shot. (Gets out. Penny drives away.)\nScene: The university cafeteria.

And then we have to stop at Soup Plantation, it\u2019s creamy tomato soup day, and Radio Shack, there\u2019s a sale on triple-a batteries. Plus, we have to go to Pottery Barn and return my Star Wars sheets.\nRaj: I have a better idea.\nSheldon: You want to go to pottery barn first?\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment, she opens the door, Sheldon is stood outside with his Star Wars sheets.\n\u00a0\nSheldon: Can you drive me to Pottery Barn? (She closes the door) Maybe if I turn off the night-light, I can keep the sheets.\nScene: The apartment. Sheldon enters from the bedroom area. Everyone else is present.\n\u00a0\nSheldon: Good morning.\nAll: Good morning.\nLeonard: Sheldon, sit down.\nSheldon: She\u2019s in my spot. Don\u2019t look at me like that, everybody knows that my spot.\nPenny: Sheldon, you know\u00a0 that we care about you.\nHoward: And it\u2019s because we care about you that we\u2019ve decided we have to speak up.\nPenny: You\u2019re hurting the people around you, sweetie.\nLeonard: So we made you an appointment, and we want you to keep it.\nSheldon: Department of motor vehicles new driver handbook? But I don\u2019t have a problem.\nLeonard: Sheldon, you need to learn how to drive.\nHoward: This madness has to stop.\nLeonard: Penny\u2019s taking you to the DMV, I\u2019m going to bed.\nSheldon: Why Penny?\nLeonard: Because rock breaks scissors, goodnight.\nPenny: All right, come on Sheldon.\nSheldon: Hold on, I have one condition.\nPenny: What?\nSheldon: We have to stop at Pottery Barn.\nPenny: Okay.\nSheldon: And Radio Shack.\nPenny: Fine.\nSheldon: And the comic book store.\nPenny: All right! (They leave.)\nHoward: Ooh, I want to go to the comic book store. (He leaves.)\nRaj: I like comic books.\nScene: The DMV.\n\u00a0\nSheldon: I just don\u2019t see why I need a driver\u2019s license, Albert Einstein never had a driver\u2019s license.\nHoward: Yeah, but Albert Einstein didn\u2019t make me wet myself at 40 miles an hour.\nPenny: Yeah, and I never wanted to kick Albert Einstein in the nuts. You know, I gotta ask, why didn\u2019t you just get a license at 16 like everybody else?\nSheldon: I was otherwise engaged.\nPenny: Doing what?\nSheldon: Examining perturbative amplitudes in n=4 supersymmetric theories leading to a re-examination of the ultraviolet properties of multi-loop n=8 supergravity using modern twistor theory.\nPenny: Well, how \u2019bout when you were 17?\nDMV Lady (to the person ahead of Sheldon in the queue): Take this to the testing area, put your name at the top, sign the bottom, answer the questions, bring it back, next! (Sheldon moves forward) Application?\nSheldon: I\u2019m actually more of a theorist.\nHoward: The application in your hand, give it to her.\nSheldon: Oh.\nDMV Lady: Take this to the testing area, put your name at the top, sign the bottom, answer the questions, bring it back, next!\nSheldon: Excuse me, but I have some concerns about these questions.\nDMV Lady: Look at that sign up there.\nSheldon: Yes?\nDMV Lady: Does it say I give a damn?\nSheldon: No.\nDMV Lady: That\u2019s because I don\u2019t.\nSheldon: Just, look, see, this first question makes no sense, how many car lengths should you leave in front of you when driving? There\u2019s no possible way to answer that, a car length is not a standardized unit of measure.\nDMV Lady: Look at the sign.\nPenny: Sheldon, it\u2019s C, just put down C.\nSheldon: I don\u2019t need your help, Penny.\nDMV Lady: Listen to that little girl, honey, put C. Next!\nSheldon: No, no, wait, no, hang on, look at this next question.\nHoward: Sheldon, why are you arguing with the DMV?\nSheldon: How else are they going to learn? Look, question 2, when are roadways most slippery? Now, okay, there are three answers, none of which are correct. The correct answer is, when covered by a film of liquid sufficient to reduce the coefficient of static friction between the tire and the road to essentially zero, but not so deep as to introduce a new source of friction.\nDMV Lady: Here\u2019s your learner\u2019s permit. Go away.\nSheldon: But I\u2019m not done. I have many additional concerns about these questions.\nDMV Lady: Don\u2019t make me climb over this counter.\nPenny: Come on, let\u2019s go.\nDMV Lady: Next!\nSheldon: Aced it.\nScene: The apartment. Howard is setting up a large kit of high tech equipment.\n\u00a0\nHoward: Okay, that\u2019s it, let\u2019s boot it up.\nLeonard: Booting.\nHoward: This is a state-of-the-art simulator. I adapted it from something a friend of mine designed for the army.\nSheldon: Is that why I appear to be in downtown Fallujah, behind the wheel of an up-armored Humvee?\nHoward: I haven\u2019t configured it yet. Let\u2019s see\u2026 Bradley tank\u2026 transport truck\u2026\u00a0 Batmobile\u2026\nSheldon: Ooh!\nLeonard: No.\nHoward: Here we go, red 2006 Ford Taurus on the streets of Pasadena.\nSheldon (sucking in breath): Hmmmm?\nHoward: What?\nSheldon: Statistically, red cars are stopped by police far more often than any other colour. I don\u2019t want any hassles with the fuzz.\nHoward: Fine, what colour do you want?\nSheldon: You know the pale blue of Luke Skywalker\u2019s lightsaber, before it was digitally remastered?\nHoward: Black it is.\nLeonard: Okay, now, what you want to do first is turn on the ignition and shift into drive.\nSheldon: I haven\u2019t fastened my seat belt yet.\nLeonard: Okay, fasten your seat belt.\nSheldon: Click. Now, are there air bags?\nLeonard: You don\u2019t need air bags.\nSheldon: What if a simulated van rear-ends me?\nPenny: I\u2019ll hit you in the face with a pillow.\nLeonard: Okay, now shift into drive, pull out slowly into traffic.\n(General panic)\n\u00a0\nPenny: Oh.\nLeonard: Oh.\nHoward: Oh.\nLeonard: Watch out.\nHoward: Oh God!\nLeonard: Watch, watch out, watch out for pedestrians!\nPenny: Oh God, wait, slow, hit the brakes, hit the brakes!\n(Sounds of car crashing. Penny hits Sheldon in face with pillow.)\nSheldon: Thank you.\nScene: The same, only Sheldon and Leonard are present. Sheldon is practicing. There are sounds of squealing tyres and brakes and general panic and mayhem.\n\u00a0\nSheldon: Sorry\u2026 excuse me\u2026 my bad\u2026 student driver\u2026\nLeonard: How did you manage to get on the second floor of the Glendale galleria?\nSheldon: I don\u2019t know. I was on the Pasadena freeway, I missed my exit, flew off the overpass, and one thing led to another.\nLeonard: Maybe you want to give it a rest and try again tomorrow.\nSheldon: No. I quit. (Stands up. There is more sound of crashing and panic, then animal noises.)\nLeonard: Aw, the pet store?\nSheldon: Remind me to compliment Wolowitz on the software, it\u2019s amazingly detailed.\nLeonard: So wait,you\u2019re just gonna give up?\nSheldon: No, I\u2019m not giving up, I never give up.\nLeonard: So what is it you\u2019re doing?\nSheldon: I\u2019m transcending the situation. I\u2019m clearly too evolved for driving.\nLeonard: What does that mean?\nSheldon: Leonard, have you ever wondered why my little toes and lateral incisors are significantly smaller than the average for someone of my size?\nLeonard: I wonder a lot of things about you, Sheldon, but not\u2026 not that.\nSheldon: Well, those are indicators that I\u2019m farther along the evolutionary scale than the average human.\nLeonard: No kidding.\nSheldon: Well, no, no, I\u2019m not going to go so far as to say that I represent a distinct new stage in humankind, you know, a Homo Novus, if you will, no, that\u2019s for anthropologists to decide. But I am convinced that the reason I cannot master the plebeian task of driving is because I\u2019m not meant to.\nLeonard: Yes, you are, you\u2019re meant to learn how to drive. Please learn how to drive!\nSheldon: No, no. Leonard, I\u2019m meant for greater things, like unraveling the mysteries of the universe, not determining when it\u2019s safe to pass a stopped school bus on a country road.\nLeonard: It\u2019s never safe.\nSheldon: Yeah, well, I know that now.\nLeonard: Fine. Assuming that everything you say is true, how does the biologically superior Homo Novus get to work tomorrow morning?\nSheldon: Homo Novus doesn\u2019t know.\nLeonard: Well, hang in there, maybe you\u2019ll evolve into something with wings.\nScene: A corridor in the university. Sheldon emerges from his office in a shower cap and bathrobe. The others are turning the corner. \n\u00a0\nSheldon: Good morning, gentlemen.\nLeonard: Hey.\nRaj: Good morning. Is there some new kind of casual Friday I don\u2019t know about?\nLeonard: No, he lives here now.\nHoward: Really? Why?\nLeonard: Well, since he won\u2019t take the bus and he\u2019s too evolved to drive, he decided it would be easier to just sleep in his office and shower in the radiation lab until I\u2019m finished with my experiment.\nRaj: But you finished your experiment a week ago.\nLeonard: Yep\nScene: The cafeteria, late at night. Two cleaning ladies enter and find a plate with toast crusts.\n\u00a0\nCleaning Lady 1 (in Spanish, subtitles): Oh my God, again?\nCleaning Lady 2: It must be rats.\nCleaning Lady 1: Rats don\u2019t make toast and cut off the crust.\n\u00a0\n(They are startled by a noise. One of them drops the plate, it smashes on the floor. Sheldon is by the drink machine, he is wearing a cloak with a hood)\n\u00a0\nSheldon: You saw nothing! (Sweeps hood around himself and vanishes through cafeteria door.)\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "8_16": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The apartment.\nAmy: I just read about an experiment designed to see if you could make two people fall in love in a matter of hours.\nLeonard: That doesn\u2019t sound right. My research has shown that it takes three to five years of shameless begging.\nPenny: Honey, neither of us comes off good in that story.\nRaj: Yeah, I, I, I saw that article you\u2019re talking about. Uh, the participants ask each other a series of questions designed to promote intimacy.\nAmy: And then they finish it off by staring into each other\u2019s eyes for four minutes.\nSheldon: Oh, that\u2019s nonsense. I proclaimed my love for you. And the last time I looked into your eyes was when you thought you had conjunctivitis.\nAmy: Other than the fact that I had it, that was a magical night.\nPenny: Raj, would you ever try an experiment like that with Emily?\nRaj: What? I don\u2019t need science to win her heart. I have my family\u2019s wealth for that.\nLeonard: I\u2019m telling you, you can\u2019t create love in a few hours. Right?\nPenny: Oh, careful. You\u2019re poking at the whole foundation of The Bachelor.\nSheldon: Yeah, but we don\u2019t have to debate this. We\u2019re scientists. We can conduct our own research. I propose that we imprison two street people and\u2026\nAmy: No.\nSheldon: You didn\u2019t even let me finish.\nAmy: Forget it.\nSheldon: So, you can experiment on all the apes you want. But I want to manipulate the emotions of two captive human beings, suddenly I\u2019m the monster.\nRaj: Why don\u2019t you just do the test?\nSheldon: In the interest of science, I\u2019d be willing to.\nPenny: What? You\u2019re okay with an experiment where you have to answer awkward questions about your innermost feelings?\nSheldon: Yes.\nPenny: Please, can I do it with him? Please?\nLeonard: I\u2019ve been listening to Sheldon\u2019s feelings on things for ten years. Tag, you\u2019re it.\nRaj: Yeah, but what if the experiment works?\nPenny: I\u2019m not gonna fall in love with Sheldon.\nAmy: That\u2019s what I said. Before I knew it, he pontificated his way right into my heart.\nSheldon: Uh, fun fact, pontificate comes from the Latin word pontifex, which means bridge builder or Pope.\nLeonard: In love yet?\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The hallway. \nSheldon: Just out of curiosity, Penny, if this experiment does make us fall in love, would you drive me to Lake Geneva, Wisconsin for Gary Con? It\u2019s the only convention celebrating the life and work of Gary Gygax, the co-creator of Dungeons and Dragons.\nPenny: You know what? I can honestly say if we fall in love, not only will I drive you there, I will buy you all the dragon T-shirts you want.\nSheldon: Okay, babe, let\u2019s do this.\nScene: The apartment.\nRaj: You guys are really being calm about Penny and Sheldon doing this thing. If it were me I\u2019d, I\u2019d be a little nervous.\nAmy: Why?\nRaj: Well, even if the study\u2019s nonsense, I don\u2019t believe in tempting fate. Same reason I wouldn\u2019t use a Ouija board, or pick a fight with an Asian guy. He probably doesn\u2019t know karate, but why risk it?\nAmy: I think we\u2019re safe.\nRaj: Well, that\u2019s what the bullies at Bruce Lee\u2019s high school thought. And then, bam. Karate.\nLeonard: Well, are we just gonna sit here while they do the experiment?\nAmy: The two of us could do it.\nLeonard: Yeah, sure, that might be fun.\nAmy: What\u2019s the first question?\nRaj: Hang on. Okay. Given the choice of anyone in the world, whom would you want as a dinner guest?\nLeonard: Hmm. I can honestly say Penny.\nAmy: Oh, then I choose a janitor, \u2019cause I\u2019m about to throw up.\nLeonard: I\u2019m in love. Let\u2019s do something else.\nRaj: Ooh, uh, Emily gets off work soon. Why don\u2019t the four of us go out?\nLeonard: Okay.\nAmy: Sounds good.\nLeonard: Should we call Howard and Bernadette?\nRaj: I don\u2019t know what time their plane gets in, but let me, let me shoot them a text.\nAmy: Did he say anything about the funeral?\nRaj: Not much, but he seemed to be in a pretty good place.\nScene: An airport baggage desk.\nHoward: Are you kidding me? You lost my mother\u2019s ashes?\nBaggage Clerk: No, I\u2019m just saying that sometimes bags are misrouted.\nHoward: All right, fine. Where did you misroute the only woman who ever loved me? The first, well,\nfirst, I meant first.\nClerk: I just need some information. Uh, what\u2019s the flight number?\nBernadette: Eight sixteen.\nHoward: I really did mean first.\nBernadette: Just drop it.\nClerk: And can you describe the bag?\nBernadette: Um, well, it\u2019s, uh, black. There\u2019s a red ribbon tied to the handle.\nHoward: The world\u2019s greatest mom is in the shoe compartment.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment.\nSheldon: You ready to begin?\nPenny: Yup. Be right there. I assume you don\u2019t want wine.\nSheldon: Correct. You\u2019re not supposed to drink alcohol when operating heavy machinery.\nPenny: What heavy machinery? Let\u2019s just start.\nSheldon: Well, as a Texas gentleman, I\u2019m inclined to say ladies first. Although, I\u2019m concerned that level of politeness and charm might make you fall in love with me before the test even begins. Perhaps we should flip a coin. Or if you\u2019re familiar with the rules of Rock, Paper, Scissors\u2026\nPenny: Question one. Given the choice of anyone in the world, whom would you want as a dinner guest?\nSheldon: Hmm. Living or dead?\nPenny: Just says anyone in the world. I guess that means living.\nSheldon: Ah, that\u2019s just as well. As much as I\u2019d love to meet Euclid, inventor of the geometric proof, he probably wore sandals and I cannot look at toes during dinner. Oh, I know, the person I\u2019d most like to have dinner with is myself.\nPenny: You sure that\u2019s your choice? \u2018Cause I\u2019ve had that dinner.\nSheldon: Well, I haven\u2019t. And while they say never meet your heroes, I just don\u2019t see how I could disappoint. Who would you choose?\nPenny: Robert Downey, Jr.\nSheldon: Oh, I didn\u2019t think of Iron Man. You know, maybe after myself and I have dinner, we can meet you two for dessert.\nScene: Raj\u2019s car.\nRaj: So, what do you guys want to do?\nAmy: Well, we\u2019re the ones tagging along, you pick.\nEmily: Ooh, have you ever been to an escape room?\nLeonard: What\u2019s that?\nEmily: Um, it\u2019s kind of like interactive theatre, except you have to solve puzzles in a certain amount of time to get out. There\u2019s one downtown where they trap you in a room with a zombie.\nRaj: Oh, so kind of like what\u2019s happening with Penny right now.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment.\nSheldon: What would constitute a perfect day for you?\nPenny: Uh, well, I\u2019d probably sleep in, do a little yoga, then lie on the beach while cute cabana boys brought me drinks and probably get a massage and then cap off the night with some dancing.\nSheldon: That\u2019s it?\nPenny: Yeah, why?\nSheldon: You didn\u2019t mention Leonard.\nPenny: He\u2019s there.\nSheldon: I don\u2019t think so. Leonard can\u2019t stand yoga, the beach, massages or dancing.\nPenny: Yeah, well, he brought a book, okay? What\u2019s yours?\nSheldon: Uh, I wake up. Uh, I enjoy some French toast with butter and syrup. Uh, then a wormhole opens, and whisks me millions of years into the future where my towering intellect is used to save the last remnants of mankind from a predatory alien race.\nPenny: Interesting, you didn\u2019t mention Amy.\nSheldon: Who do you think made the French toast with butter and syrup?\nScene: An escape room.\nWoman in lab coat: You\u2019re about to enter the lab of the late Dr. David Saltzberg. While conducting studies on slowing the aging process, there was a catastrophic accident and he died. Or did he?\nLeonard: Ladies?\nEmily: Are you being polite or scared?\nLeonard: Yup.\nEmily: Ah, what a room!\nAmy: Oh.\nLeonard: This is cool.\nAmy: So, how do we start?\nEmily: We have to look for the clues hidden around the room.\nRaj: Uh, wasn\u2019t there supposed to be a zombie?\nZombie: Uuuuuuuh!\nRaj: Ooh. Okay, let\u2019s hope one of the clues is written on a pair of clean underwear.\nScene: The Baggage Claim.\nClerk: Mr. and Mrs. Wolowitz? As far as I can tell, your bag arrived in Los Angeles.\nBernadette: So, where is it?\nClerk: I don\u2019t know, perhaps somebody took it off the carousel by mistake?\nHoward: So, some stranger has my mom? Is that what you\u2019re telling me? My poor mother can be anywhere in Los Angeles right now?\nClerk: I, I wish I was telling you that. Um, but the passenger could\u2019ve gotten on an international flight.\nHoward: Oh, okay, great. So, your entire job is to find lost luggage, and you\u2019ve narrowed down the location of my mother to the planet Earth.\nClerk: I\u2019m sorry. W, would 500 frequent-flyer miles help? That could get you to Sacramento.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment.\nSheldon: If you could wake up tomorrow having gained any one quality or ability, what would it be?\nPenny: Well, not to steal from the Bible, but turning water into wine sounds pretty good.\nSheldon: I don\u2019t think you\u2019re taking this seriously.\nPenny: Come on, I\u2019m just having some fun with you.\nSheldon: I believe what you\u2019re doing is using humour to avoid vulnerability.\nPenny: Fine. Honestly, if I could have one quality, I wish I could be as smart as you guys.\nSheldon: Ha. Keep dreaming.\nPenny: Sheldon.\nShedon: I\u2019m sorry. That was me having fun with you. Look, you may not be as, as academically inclined as are we. Yes, that\u2019s how you say it. But, you possess an intelligence I envy. Which leads me to my answer. I would choose the ability to read people\u2019s minds.\nPenny: Well, I can\u2019t read people\u2019s minds. Actually, that\u2019s not true, I can read men\u2019s minds, but only \u2019cause it\u2019s usually the one thing.\nSheldon: When are we going to get robot eyes?\nPenny: You\u2019re all alike.\nSheldon: Well, what I meant was I often misinterpret how others are feeling. Like, I can\u2019t always tell if someone is only joking or laughing at me. You know, like, uh, if they\u2019re mad at something I\u2019ve done or just in a bad mood. It, it\u2019s incredibly stressful.\nPenny: Really? You always seem so confident.\nSheldon: Well, I\u2019m not. And if I could read people\u2019s minds, life would be so much simpler.\nPenny: Well, now I wish I had the ability to make that stuff easier for you.\nSheldon: Thank you.\nPenny: Wow, I just felt this wave of affection for you.\nSheldon: You sure it\u2019s not too much Bible juice?\nPenny: And the wave is gone.\nScene: The escape room.\nZombie: Brains!\nAmy: Keep it down, we\u2019re working here.\nRaj: Okay, we\u2019ve got the cipher decoded.\nEmily: How\u2019s it going with the globe?\nAmy: We used the coordinates to locate the cities.\nLeonard: I\u2019m putting the city names in the grid now. I\u2019m sure that\u2019ll give us the code to the safe.\nZombie: Solve puzzle too fast! Slow down!\nLeonard: Yup. Got the code.\nZombie: Just saying, no refund for finish early!\nScene: The baggage check.\nBernadette: Sure you don\u2019t want to go home? When the bag\u2019s returned, they\u2019ll deliver it to us.\nHoward: No, I\u2019m not leaving without her.\nBernadette: All right, we\u2019ll wait.\nHoward: I could\u2019ve driven her.\nBernadette: What?\nHoward: The day she left for Florida. She asked me to drive her to the airport. I was too busy. And I made her take a cab. I was too busy.\nBernadette: There\u2019s no way you could\u2019ve known. Be right back. Excuse me?\nClerk: Yes?\nBernadette: You better find my husband\u2019s mother \u2019cause one way or another, w e\u2019re walking out of this airport with a dead woman.\nScene: The escape room.\nLeonard: Which book are we looking for?\nRaj: Uh, Origin of Species.\nLeonard: Here it is. There\u2019s a black light.\nEmily: Oh, hang on.\nRaj: Oh, okay. Uh, brothers and sisters I have none, but this man\u2019s father is my father\u2019s son. Who am I looking at? Yeah, yeah, we get it, you want brains. Calm down.\nAmy: Well, if I don\u2019t have a brother, my father\u2019s son is me. And if I\u2019m this man\u2019s father, then he\u2019s my son. The answer\u2019s son.\nEmily: Ooh. There\u2019s a picture of the sun over there.\nLeonard: I bet the key\u2019s behind it.\nZombie: Could be somewhere else.\nEmily: Oh, got the key.\nAmy: So, that\u2019s the key to the door? That\u2019s it?\nLeonard: We spent two hundred dollars on six minutes of fun?\nRaj: It\u2019s like when you bought that remote-controlled helicopter, and it just flew away.\nEmily: Sorry, guys. Really thought the puzzles would be better.\nAmy: Well, to be fair, we do all have advanced degrees.\nZombie: Remember that before you post on Yelp.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment.\nPenny: If you were to die this evening with no opportunity to communicate with anyone, what would you most regret not having told someone?\nSheldon: So, it would be today? Huh. Well, I suppose there\u2019s something satisfying about dying on my birthday.\nPenny: Today\u2019s your birthday?\nSheldon: Yes.\nPenny: Well, that\u2019s always been a secret. Not even Amy knows.\nSheldon: Well, I don\u2019t enjoy presents. And the thought of people jumping out and yelling surprise fills me with more dread than the words George Lucas Director\u2019s Cut.\nPenny: So, why did you finally tell me?\nSheldon: The point of the experiment is to be completely honest with each other.\nPenny: Well, thank you for sharing it with me. I won\u2019t tell anyone.\nSheldon: Thank you.\nPenny: That is so funny. I never would have pegged you for a Pisces.\nSheldon: You\u2019re making it difficult to love you right now.\nScene: The baggage check.\nClerk: Great news, your bag was returned.\nHoward: Oh, thank God. It\u2019s okay, she\u2019s here. Ma\u2019s here.\nBernadette: Okay, thank you so much.\nHoward: Ma? I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t take you to the airport. I just want you to know that I\u2019ll never forgive myself for being so selfish. And I promise to keep you close for the rest of my life.\nBernadette: Oh, no. That thing\u2019s gonna end up in my bedroom.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment.\nSheldon: That\u2019s it. We\u2019re done with the questions.\nPenny: All that\u2019s left to do is stare into each other\u2019s eyes for four minutes without talking.\nSheldon: Okay. Wait, hang on. Bladder check. We\u2019re good to go.\nPenny: You ready?\nSheldon: Yes.\nPenny: And begin. This is kind of creepy.\nSheldon: We\u2019re not supposed to talk during this part.\nPenny: Sorry.\nSheldon: This is kind of creepy.\nPenny: Do you want to stop? I know you have trouble with eye contact.\nSheldon: Well, you have a brown fleck in your right iris that looks like a Formula One race car. So I\u2019m just concentrating on that. Plus, it\u2019s easier around people that I\u2019m comfortable with.\nPenny: Aw, sweetie, I\u2019m comfortable around you, too.\nSheldon: Of course you are, I\u2019m warm and soothing. I\u2019m like a human bowl of tomato soup.\nPenny: I meant more like a little brother.\nSheldon: Oh. Well, I suppose I do think of you as a sister. And sometimes, a mother.\nPenny: It\u2019s getting creepy again.\nSheldon: What?\nPenny: Just thinking about the day I met you and Leonard.\nSheldon: It was a Monday afternoon. You joined us for Indian food.\nPenny: Can you believe it\u2019s been eight years?\nSheldon: Yeah, and you\u2019re still eating our food.\nPenny: I can\u2019t remember a time you guys weren\u2019t in my life.\nSheldon: I remember it perfectly. But I have an eidetic memory. If you\u2019re interested, I also remember how much you owe us for the food.\nPenny: That\u2019s it. That wasn\u2019t so bad.\nSheldon: No, it wasn\u2019t. Uh, now let\u2019s tabulate the results of the experiment. I think it\u2019s safe to say that you\u2019re not in love with me and I\u2019m not in love with you. And psychology has once again proved itself the doofus of the sciences.\nPenny: Well, maybe. But I\u2019m still glad we did it. I do feel closer to you.\nSheldon: And I, you. And yes, that\u2019s how you say that. Yeah, so, given our newfound intimacy, I\u2019d say we have some hard choices to make.\nPenny: Like what?\nSheldon: Gary Con, do we fly or drive? Do we wear costumes? And if so, who gets to be Gary?\nScene: The hallway.\nSheldon: Thank you for walking me home.\nPenny: I just want to make sure you get there safe.\nSheldon: Well, this is me. It\u2019s been a very interesting evening.\nPenny: It really has.\nAll: SURPRISE!\nSheldon: Aah! And after I let you be Gary.\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "2_21": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The apartment.\nHoward: Okay, are you from Star Wars universe?\nLeonard: Yes\nHoward: Were you in the original trilogy?\nLeonard: Yes\nHoward: Is there a picture of you in my wallet wearing a metal bikini?\nLeonard: God, I hope not. And no, I\u2019m not Princess Leia.\nRaj: Oh, okay, okay, my turn. Are you in the six Star Wars movies?\nLeonard: Yes\nRaj: Interesting. Are you a Droid?\nLeonard: Yes\nRaj: Do you kind of look like a shiny Sheldon?\nLeonard: Yes\nRaj: C3PO.\nLeonard: You got it.\nSheldon: That\u2019s preposterous. I do not resemble C3PO. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m flattered, I just don\u2019t see it.\nHoward (phone rings): Leslie Winkle. You\u2019ve reached friends with benefits. For a booty call, press one now.\nSheldon: What exactly does that expression mean, friends with benefits? Does he provide her with health insurance?\nLeonard: No. Look, imagine you maintained a friendship with someone you had sex with, but you were free to date whoever you wanted.\nSheldon: I\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t imagine any of that.\nLeonard: Alright, back to the game.\nSheldon: I believe it\u2019s my turn, you may begin your questions whenever you\u2019re ready.\nRaj: Are you Spock?\nSheldon: I don\u2019t like this game.\nHoward: So, where were we?\nRaj: Aren\u2019t you leaving for your booty call?\nHoward: No, it was something else. Why does everything have to be about sex with you? Come on. Who\u2019s turn is it?\nLeonard: We were up to you.\nHoward: Great, just start.\nLeonard: Okay, let\u2019s see. Are you from a TV series?\nHoward: She dumped me!\nSheldon: I bet he\u2019s someone from Babylon 5, we\u2019re never going to guess.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: A few moments later.\n \nRaj: What happened with Leslie, why did she dump you?\nHoward: I don\u2019t know. She just said Howard, momma\u2019s a rolling stone. And then her call waiting beeped and she was gone.\nSheldon: I don\u2019t understand. If you were in a non-emotional relationship then why are you having \u00a0what appears be an emotional response?\nLeonard: Sheldon, he obviously had feelings for her.\nHoward: Of course I had feelings for her, I saw her naked for God\u2019s sake!\nLeonard: Okay, uh look, you just need to get your mind off it. Do you want to go to the comic book store? Maybe go see a movie?\nHoward: I don\u2019t want to go anywhere.\nSheldon: You know, I\u2019m given to understand that there is an entire city in Nevada designed specifically to help people like Howard forget their problems. Where\u00a0 you can replace them with new problems such as alcoholism, gambling addiction and sexually transmitted diseases.\nRaj: Is it me, or was that Sheldon\u2019s way of saying Vegas baby!\nLeonard: I\u2019ve never been there, have you?\nRaj: Me? No. I just got Vegas baby from Vince Vaughn in Swingers. .\nHoward: It could be fun. I know my weekend\u2019s wide open, now that\u2026\nLeonard: Okay, then let\u2019s do this, lets go to Las Vegas.\nHoward: Now? Right now?\nLeonard: Why not? People do things right now all the time. Why can\u2019t we be right now people too. Go home, pack a bag and we\u2019ll be right now people. I have to stop at the drug store to refill a prescription, but after that we\u2019ll go right now.\nRaj: What do you say, Howard?\nHoward: I say Vegas baby!\nRaj: What are you going to tell your mother?\nHoward: Sea World, baby!\nLeonard: Hey, Sheldon, are you coming?\nSheldon: I\u2019d rather have a blowfly lay eggs and hatch larvae in my auditory canal.\nLeonard: Great, we\u2019ll bring you back a tee-shirt.\nScene: The lobby.\nSheldon: Thank you. Hello, neighbour.\nPenny: Hello, Sheldon.\nSheldon: And how are you doing this fine evening?\nPenny: Great.\nSheldon: Good. I\u2019m glad.\nPenny: Really? Are you drunk?\nSheldon: I\u2019m just in a good mood. While my compatriots are in Las Vegas, I will be enjoying a blissful evening in my personal Fortress of Solitude.\nPenny: That\u2019s Superman\u2019s big ice thing, right?\nSheldon: Do you know, I\u2019m such a good mood, I\u2019m actually finding your tenuous grasp of the English language folksy and charming today.\nPenny: Mmm, what smells so good?\nSheldon: That is the intoxicating aroma of Kadhai Paneer, a perfect culinary representation of the freedom this evening holds. Not only is it Indian cuisine, which Koothrappali loathes, it contains a generous helping of peanuts, which would reduce Wolowitz to a wheezing 97 pound blister. And finally, it\u2019s main ingredient is Paneer, a farmer\u2019s cheese which would cause Leonard to render any room uninhabitable within minutes.\nPenny: Yum. Well, enjoy your big evening.\nSheldon: Penny. I realize you are also on your own tonight, so if at some point you find yourself with nothing to do, please do not disturb me.\nPenny: Have fun, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Oh, I shall. (Sings Superman theme while searching his pockets.) No!\nPenny: What\u2019s wrong, Superman? Locked out of your big ice thingy?\nScene: A Vegas bathroom.\n \nRaj: Look at this, mouthwash, lotion, body wash, shampoo and conditioner together in one tiny bottle. I love Las Vegas.\nLeonard: Howard, could I borrow some after shave?\nHoward: Black case, top compartment.\nLeonard: That is a lot of cologne.\nHoward: First row are your musks, second is wood, leathers and botanicals, third is assorted pheromones, tread lightly.\nRaj (finding a large quantity of condoms): That\u2019s the spirit, Howard. Yes, we can.\nLeonard: Come on, let\u2019s go.\nHoward: You guys go ahead, I just have to finish up an email.\nLeonard: That\u2019s not an email, that\u2019s Leslie\u2019s facebook page.\nHoward: Okay, fine, I\u2019m checking her facebook page, look at her status update, she\u2019s saying she dumped me, people need to know I dumped her.\nRaj: But she did dump you.\nHoward: Grow up, Raj,there\u2019s no place for truth on the internet. Just go, I\u2019ll catch up with you.\nLeonard: Alright.\nRaj: Oh, we should have a plan in case one of us gets lucky.\nLeonard: Okay, uh, if I get lucky I\u2019ll take her to my stately manor outside Gotham City, and if you get lucky, I\u2019ll sleep on the moon.\nRaj: Sounds like a plan.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment. \nPenny: Hang on, I think the emergency key is around here somewhere.\nSheldon: We have a bowl. Our keys go in a bowl. You should get a bowl.\nPenny: So, how did the beautiful mind of Sheldon Cooper forget his key in the first place.\nSheldon: I left them in the bowl.\nPenny: Oh-oh. I just remembered where the emergency key is.\nSheldon: Where?\nPenny: In your apartment.\nSheldon: What\u2019s it doing in my apartment?\nPenny: Well, I went in there a few weeks ago when you guys weren\u2019t home, and I forgot it there.\nSheldon: You were in my\u2026 why would you\u2026 what are you saying?\nPenny: It\u2019s not a big deal, I was making coffee and I ran out of milk.\nSheldon: You\u2019re the milk thief! Leonard said I was crazy but I knew that carton felt lighter.\nPenny: Alright, Sheldon, let\u2019s just calm down and we\u2019ll call the building manager, he\u2019ll come open your door, you just eat your dinner here while you\u2019re waiting.\nSheldon: Eat? My dinner? In your apartment?\nPenny: Yeah, why not?\nSheldon: Sure, why not? And after the sun\u2019s down we can all pile in my pick-up and go skinny-dipping down at the creek. \u2018Cause today\u2019s the day to stop making sense.\nScene: A bar at the Las Vegas Casino.\n \nLeonard (to barmaid): Thanks.\nRaj: I\u2019m telling you, Leonard, video slot machines, free drinks brought to us by a bosomy barmaid and all you can eat shrimp for $3.95. Disneyland can suck it. This is the real happiest place on earth.\nLeonard (as he wins on his slot machine): Dude, check it out. That\u2019s laundry for a month!\nWoman (leaning over Raj): Hi.\nRaj (taking a big gulp of his drink): Hello.\nWoman: What\u2019s your name?\nRaj: Rajesh Ramayan Koothrappali.\nWoman: Hello Rajesh Ram\u2026 Hi, Rajesh, I\u2019m Michaela.\nRaj: Hello, Michaela.\nMichaela: So, are you interested a little party?\nRaj: Why, yes, I love to party. Party is my middle name. Or it would be, if it weren\u2019t Ramayan.\nLeonard: Uh, Raj, can I, can I talk to you for a moment.\nRaj: Not now, Leonard, Michaela\u2019s inviting me to a party. You better call the moon and you make sure that they have a bed for you.\nLeonard: Yeah, I really need to talk to you.\nRaj: Excuse me, I\u2019ll be right back. Don\u2019t go anywhere. Don\u2019t move. Just stay the beautiful unspoiled American flower that you are. (To Leonard) What\u2019s wrong with you dude, that woman was all up in my jammy.\nLeonard: Okay, I hate to break this to you and whatever your jammy is, but, I\u2019m pretty sure she is a prostitute.\nRaj: What? No. ..\nLeonard: Okay, let me put it this way, in your entire life, how many gorgeous women have walked straight up to you in a bar and asked if you wanted to party.\nRaj: Maybe I can save her.\nLeonard: Maybe, but I\u2019m guessing it will cost you about $500 an hour to try.\nRaj: It was lovely meeting you, best of luck in your future endeavours.\nMichaela: Whatever.\nRaj: Oh, I miss her already.\nLeonard: Oh, Howard\u2019s losing it. Check out his latest twitters. \u201cI\u2019m at the bottom of a black hole staring into the abyss. My life is meaningless, my future is without hope.\u201d\nRaj: Why don\u2019t we take him to see the Blue Man Group?\nLeonard: You think that\u2019d help?\nRaj: USA Today calls them exuberant fun for the whole family.\nLeonard: I don\u2019t know, Howard isn\u2019t really the family fun kind of guy.\nRaj: It\u2019s too bad he wasn\u2019t here for that hooker. She\u2019s exactly his type. A hooker. You know, I bet if we hired her, that would cheer him up.\nLeonard: We\u2019re not going to get Wolowitz a hooker.\nRaj (reading Howard\u2019s twitter): \u201cI\u2019m so lonely and horny I may open this $20 jar of peanuts and end it all.\u201d\nLeonard: Suppose it wouldn\u2019t hurt to get an estimate.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment.\n \nSheldon: So, how was your day?\nPenny: Are you trying to make small talk? Oh, sweetie, you really don\u2019t have to.\nSheldon: No, it\u2019s the accepted convention. How was your day?\nPenny: Well, uh, they shifted my schedule around at the restaurant so my hours are going to be a little different\u2026\nSheldon: I\u2019m sorry, that\u2019s not going to interest me at all, just eat.\nScene: The casino bar. \n \nRaj: Hello again.\nMichaela: Oh, hi.\nLeonard: Yeah, hi, listen, m, if you\u2019re not busy, well, w-we were thinking you could\u2026 well, we were wondering\u2026\nRaj: If you\u2019re really a prostitute.\nMichaela: You guys cops?\nTogether: No.\nMichaela: I am a prostitute.\nLeonard: Okay, great. Um\u2026 uh, the thing is, we\u2019ve got this friend, and he\u2019s kind of down in the dumps, and we thought that maybe you could cheer him up.\nRaj: With sex.\nLeonard: I think she knows what I meant.\nRaj: How can she when you beat around the bush. She\u2019s from the mean streets where they shoot from the hip and keep it real.\nMichaela: Don\u2019t worry, I can take good care of your friend.\nLeonard: Okay, terrific. Um, uh, listen, is there a way that we can do this where he doesn\u2019t know that you\u2019re a\u2026 you know\u2026\nRaj: Prostitute.\nMichaela: You want the girlfriend experience.\nLeonard: Yes, yeah, exactly, the girlfriend experience.\nRaj: Uh, actually, if it\u2019s not too much to ask, could we have the Jewish girlfriend experience.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment.\n \nSheldon: Okay, that\u2019s question 20, you have to guess.\nPenny: Oh, God, I don\u2019t know Sheldon, are you Star Wars?\nSheldon: How can one person be a whole movie?\nPenny: Okay, I give up, can we just do something else?\nSheldon: Fine. I was Spock. Are you and Leonard friends with benefits.\nPenny: What?\nSheldon: Are you and Leonard friends with benefits?\nPenny: Where did that even come from, did he say we were?\nSheldon: No, Leonard said nothing, but who knows what goes on over here when he pretends your mail was misdelivered.\nPenny: No, just mail, no benefits.\nSheldon: Hmm, I see.\nPenny: Why are you asking?\nSheldon: I\u2019m curious about the whole social construct. On its face, the idea of satisfying ones sexual appetite, assuming one is afflicted with such, without emotional entanglement, that seems eminently practical. What I\u2019ve observed, however, is Howard Wolowitz crying like a little girl.\nPenny: Well, some people just can\u2019t handle that kind of relationship.\nSheldon: Can you?\nPenny: Excuse me?\nSheldon: Are you able to have sex with men without developing an emotional attachment?\nPenny: Sheldon, I really don\u2019t want to talk about this with you.\nSheldon: Is this conversation making you uncomfortable?\nPenny: Of course it\u2019s making me uncomfortable, can\u2019t you tell?\nSheldon: I really have no idea. I don\u2019t particularly excel at reading facial expressions, body language\u2026\nPenny: I\u2019m uncomfortable, Sheldon!\nSheldon: Thank you, that\u2019s very helpful.\nScene: The casino bar.\nHoward: Alright, where are these amazing shrimp?\nLeonard: Behold?\nHoward: Seriously, you think this is the size of a baby\u2019s arm?\nRaj: A little baby.\nHoward: I\u2019m going back to the room.\nMichaela (arriving): Boy, would it maybe kill them to put out a nice brisket?\nHoward: Hi there, Howard Wolowitz.\nMichaela: Esther Rosenblatt.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment.\n \nPenny: I don\u2019t think the manager\u2019s coming tonight so, here.\nSheldon: Are you suggesting I sleep on the couch.\nPenny: Well, it wasn\u2019t the first suggestion that came to mind, but it\u2019s the one I\u2019m going with.\nSheldon: I can\u2019t sleep on your couch. I sleep in a bed. And given it\u2019s dimensions I have no intention of living out E.M. Snickering\u2019s beloved children\u2019s book , The Tall Man From Cornwall.\nPenny: What?\nSheldon: There was a tall man from Cornwall whose length exceeded his bed. My body fits on it, but barely upon it, there\u2019s no room for my big Cornish head.\nPenny: Oh, alright. I will give you my bed on one condition. That you promise to zip your hole for the next eight hours.\nSheldon: May I say one last thing.\nPenny: Only if it doesn\u2019t rhyme.\nSheldon: Alright. Goodnight.\nScene: The casino bar. \nMichaela: Turn ons. Let me see. Reading a good book in front of the fire. Long walks on the beach. Getting freaky on the Sabbath with a bacon cheeseburger.\nHoward: Really, me too.\nMichaela: Oy gevalt, you\u2019re hot.\nHoward: Yeah. Excuse me for a moment.\nLeonard: Hey, how\u2019s it going.\nHoward: Cut the crap, you set this up, didn\u2019t you?\nLeonard: Yes.\nHoward: She\u2019s a hooker, isn\u2019t she.\nRaj: A prostitute, yes.\nHoward: You already gave her the money?\nLeonard: Yes.\nHoward: Thank you!\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment.\n \nSheldon: Penny.\nPenny: What?\nSheldon: I can\u2019t sleep. how are you going?\nPenny: Maybe that\u2019s because your hole is still open.\nSheldon: I\u2019m homesick.\nPenny: Your home is twenty feet from here.\nSheldon: Twenty feet, twenty light years, it doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s in a galaxy far, far away.\nPenny: Damn it. What do you want me to do\nSheldon: Sing soft kitty.\nPenny: That\u2019s only for when you\u2019re sick.\nSheldon: Homesick is a type of being sick.\nPenny: Come on, do I really have to?\nSheldon: I suppose we can stay up and talk.\nPenny: Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur. Happy kitty, um\u2026\nSheldon: Sleepy kitty.\nPenny: Sleepy ki\u2026\nSheldon: No. Start over.\nPenny: Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur. Happy kitty, sleepy kitty, purr, purr, purr.\nSheldon: Penny.\nPenny: Yeah.\nSheldon: Thank you for letting me stay here.\nPenny: Oh, you\u2019re welcome sweetie.\nSheldon: Okay, I\u2019m sleepy now, get out.\nScene: The stairwell. \n \nSheldon: Oh, good, you\u2019re finally home.\nLeonard: What were you doing at Penny\u2019s?\nSheldon: Well, we had dinner, uh, played some games, and then I spent the night.

You know, and in an effort to reduce awkwardness as we learn how to function as friends, I printed out a list of safe topics for polite conversation.\nAmy: If that makes you more comfortable.\nSheldon: If there were a list of things that make me more comfortable, lists would be on the top of that list. Okay, now, oh, since last we spoke, have you acquired any pets?\nAmy: No. You?\nSheldon: No. Um, since last we spoke, have you planned or gone on any vacations?\nAmy: I might go visit my aunt next week.\nSheldon: Mm.

I know you hate the word moist. I know\u2026\nPenny: Hang on. Wait, wait.

This isn\u2019t so bad.\nEmly: Only five hours and 40 minutes to go.\nHoward: We\u2019ve only been doing this 20 minutes?\nRaj: You know, I read that washing dishes can be an excellent form of meditation. The key is that while washing the dishes one should only be washing the dishes.\nHoward: Just because you have that accent doesn\u2019t mean what you say isn\u2019t stupid.\nRaj: No, seriously. It\u2019s about being present in the moment, focusing on the feeling of the warm water, the smell of the detergent, the sound of the dishes squeaking, and following your own breath. It\u2019s about, it\u2019s about simply being.\nHoward: Huh. Okay, I\u2019ll try it.\nSoup Kitchen Manager: I need three people out front.\nBernadette: I\u2019ll do it.\nRaj: Me.\nEmily: Right here!\nHoward: No fair, I was meditating.\nScene: The apartment. \nLeonard: Come on, don\u2019t be mad. It was a long time ago, and it was an accident.\nPenny: How can reading my journal be an accident?\nLeonard: I didn\u2019t even know what it was. I saw it on your nightstand. I picked it up.\nPenny: Well, when you realized what it was, why didn\u2019t you stop?\nLeonard: You know me, I\u2019m a big ol\u2019 bookworm.\nPenny: All right. Let\u2019s just finish cooking.\nLeonard: Well, hey, okay. Let me make this up to you. Sometimes I keep an online journal. I want you to read something that I wrote.\nPenny: Okay, really, I\u2019m fine.\nLeonard: Okay. Well, then I\u2019ll read it to you. It\u2019s from the day we first met. Beauty, thy name is Penny.\nPenny: Oh, God. Stop. I don\u2019t want you to read something you think\u2019ll just butter me up. I want to hear the most recent thing you wrote.\nLeonard: Fine. Mmm, Penny\u2019s beauty, like our love, grows more with each passing day.\u201d\nPenny: Does it really say that?\nLeonard: Why would I lie?\nPenny: OMG. OMG. We\u2019re so close to the new Star Wars. I can\u2019t take it. Gah. Gah?\nLeonard: Well, you didn\u2019t read it right. The new Star Wars is coming. Gah.\nScene: Amy\u2019s car.\nSheldon: I\u2019m sensing things have gotten awkward.\nAmy: No. It\u2019s okay. If we\u2019re friends, we should be able to talk about anything.\nSheldon: All right.\nAmy: So, you had some questions about me seeing other people.\nSheldon: Just a few.\nAmy: Go ahead.\nSheldon: How many dates have you been on? Who were they with? Where\u2019d you go? Where did you meet them? Did you sleep with them? And how much longer to the aquarium? I\u2019m getting kind of hungry.\nAmy: Let\u2019s see. I have been on six dates with three different people. It was either for coffee or dinner. One I met at a bookstore and two I met online. I haven\u2019t slept with anyone. The aquarium is 40 minutes away. And there\u2019s a baggie of Cheerios for you in the glove compartment.\nSheldon: Is that regular or honey nut?\nAmy: I mixed them.\nSheldon: You mixed them. No wonder gentleman callers are pounding down your door. Do you have any questions for me?\nAmy: Just one. Are you doing okay?\nSheldon: I am.\nAmy: Good. I want you to be happy.\nSheldon: I believe you. I\u2019d believe you more if you threw a few Apple Jacks in here.\nScene: The soup kitchen.\nMan: Here you go.\nHoward: Thanks. You got to be kidding me.\nMan: Sorry?\nHoward: Y, you\u2019re Elon Musk.\nElon: I am.\nHoward: Wh, what are you doing here?\nElon: I\u2019m washing dishes. Well, I was on the turkey line, but I got demoted for being too generous with the gravy.\nHoward: Oh, man. I, what an honour to meet you. I\u2019m, I\u2019m such a fan of Tesla and SpaceX. All your companies. Howard Wolowitz, Caltech.\nElon: Nice to meet you, Howard. Feels great to come down here and help the less fortunate, huh?\nHoward: Oh, yeah. Nothing better than helping people. Which is something I realized when I was viewing Earth from the deck of the International Space Station, where I spent two months as a payload specialist, a job I was qualified for because I\u2019m an MIT-trained engineer.\nElon: And I thought I ladled the gravy on thick.\nHoward: Sorry. It\u2019s just, you\u2019re you, you know? And I really want you to adopt me.\nElon: Well, you\u2019re here on Thanksgiving, so you\u2019re probably a good person.\nHoward: Oh. I made my wife come down, too.\nElon: You think you might ever get back out to space?\nHoward: Is that a job offer? \u2018Cause I really want to go to Mars. Assuming I can bring my wife. She hardly takes up any room. She\u2019s basically a carry-on.\nElon: Well, we\u2019re not quite there yet, but we\u2019re always looking for engineers. So let me give you my e-mail. We can stay in touch.\nHoward: Thank you.\nElon: Oh, look. Someone hardly touched their pumpkin pie. Want to share it with me?\nHoward: A partially eaten piece of pumpkin pie from a homeless shelter? With Elon Musk, you bet I do.\nScene: The aquarium. \nSheldon: You know, for a Thanksgiving buffet in an aquarium cafeteria, that was really bad.\nAmy: You\u2019re just upset \u2019cause they ran out of Pilgrim hats.\nSheldon: They gave one to that baby. He wasn\u2019t even awake.\nAmy: Well, it wouldn\u2019t be a holiday without you being mad at a baby.\nSheldon: Oh. Would you care to play an ocean-themed game I invented?\nAmy: Sure. What is it?\nSheldon: It\u2019s called Food, Friend, Fight. One of us chooses three aquatic creatures, and the other one must decide which he would eat, befriend, or battle.\nAmy: So it\u2019s like Kiss, Marry, Kill.\nSheldon: What is that?\nAmy: It\u2019s a game where you\u2019re given three people and you choose which one you\u2019d kiss, marry, or kill.\nSheldon: Well, my game is better, \u2019cause instead of marrying someone, you get to eat them.\nAmy: Let\u2019s just play.\nSheldon: I\u2019ll start you off easy. Electric eel, pufferfish, shrimp.\nAmy: Hmm. Well, I wouldn\u2019t fight the eel, because I know it can generate enough current to kill a horse. So I\u2019d eat the eel, fight the shrimp, and befriend the pufferfish, because it would be nice to have company on those days I feel bloated.\nSheldon: Very well done.\nAmy: Thank you. Okay, your turn. Hmm. Seal, hagfish, SpongeBob SquarePants.\nSheldon: Well, I\u2019d befriend SpongeBob but he\u2019s not real, so I can\u2019t do that, can I?\nAmy: But you can pal around with a hagfish?\nSheldon: Hey, let\u2019s not pull at that thread. Okay. I\u2019ll fight SpongeBob, because he\u2019s so friendly we\u2019ll just end up tickling each other. Um, I\u2019ll befriend the seal, because he\u2019s trainable, which is the problem I\u2019m having with my current friends. Which means I\u2019ll have to eat the hagfish.\nAmy: Isn\u2019t that gross? I mean, a hagfish can produce enough mucus to fill a bucket in a minute.\nSheldon: I know. It makes its own gravy, it\u2019ll slide right down.\nAmy: I miss this.\nSheldon: How can you miss a game you\u2019ve never played before, silly?\nAmy: I guess sometimes I\u2019m silly.\nScene: The apartment. \nPenny: Hey. Where\u2019d you go? I can\u2019t tell if the turkey\u2019s done.\nLeonard: Be right there. Hi, lover.\nPenny: What are you doing?\nLeonard: I\u2019m sorry about the journal. I want to make it up to you. So I\u2019m gonna let you post a shame photo of me on Facebook.\nPenny: I am not putting that on the Internet. I don\u2019t want people to see this. I don\u2019t want to see it.\nLeonard: Don\u2019t want people to see what, huh? A little bit of this?\nPenny: Oh.\nLeonard: Huh? Some of this? And, since it\u2019s Thanksgiving, an extra helping of this?\nBernadette: Happy Thanks\u2026 Yikes.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: I\u2019m glad you had a nice time with Amy.\nSheldon: Me, too. It\u2019s comforting to know that she and I are able to function as friends.\nPenny: Well, I\u2019ve never been friends with any of my exes.\nSheldon: Oh, I\u2019m sure you and Leonard will be able to pull it off. (Phone rings) Oh. It\u2019s my friend Amy. Hello.\nAmy: Hi, Sheldon. I\u2019m just driving home from my mother\u2019s.\nSheldon: Did you have a nice time?\nAmy: I did. Um, listen, I really enjoyed spending this morning with you.\nSheldon: Well, I can\u2019t take all the credit. It was pretty funny when that one anchovy started going the wrong way.\nAmy: It was. Uh, listen, I, I was thinking that, um, maybe I\u2019m ready to be your girlfriend again.\nSheldon: Oh. I thought we were just friends.\nAmy: We are. But I was hoping, maybe\u2026\nSheldon: Amy, I excel at many things, but getting over you wasn\u2019t one of them. I think I need to just be your friend.\nAmy: Okay. I understand.\nSheldon: Good. Oh, I watched a video of the hagfish producing mucus, so I\u2019m gonna change my answer and eat SpongeBob.\nAmy: Okay. Sure.\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "7_2": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The stairwell\nSheldon: And here\u2019s another interesting weather fact.\nPenny: Another? Great.\nSheldon: Changes in jet streams can affect the speed at which the Earth rotates on its axis, so bad weather can actually make the day longer.\nPenny: Well, there must be a hell of a storm somewhere.\nSheldon: Joke if you must, but you\u2019re going to miss these moments. With Leonard home in a few days, this was your last time driving me to the grocery store.\nPenny: You know, I will miss this.\nSheldon: I\u2019ll tell you what, if my apples are mealy, we\u2019ll hit the produce section for one last crazy blowout. Heck, you can even push the cart. Please don\u2019t take my looking forward to Leonard\u2019s return as criticism of the job you\u2019ve been doing in his absence.\nPenny: I won\u2019t.\nSheldon: That criticism will come later in your report card.\nPenny: Yeah, I didn\u2019t stay for the detention, I\u2019m not gonna read the report card.\nLeonard (in Penny\u2019s apartment): Hello.\nPenny (screams): Leonard! Hi!\nLeonard: Keep your voice down.\nPenny: Oh, my God. You weren\u2019t supposed to be here till Sunday.\nLeonard: We finished the experiment early, so I thought I\u2019d come home and surprise you.\nPenny: Oh, my gosh, why are we whispering?\nLeonard: I didn\u2019t tell Sheldon, so we could have a few days alone.\nPenny: Oh, that is so romantic.\nLeonard: Uh, sure, that\u2019s why I did it.\nPenny: Oh, I just cannot believe you\u2019re here.\nSheldon (off): Penny, it\u2019s your lucky day. Three of the eggs are clearly not jumbo. Grab your keys.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The comic book store.\nSheldon: Uh, Stuart, I was wondering if you could help me find something.\nStuart: Happy to, unless it\u2019s hope or a reason to live.\nSheldon: Oh, you make me laugh, sad clown. Anyhoo, Leonard will be back in a couple days and I need a welcome home gift for him. As he\u2019s been at sea, perhaps something with a nautical theme might be appropriate.\nStuart: Okay, well, I don\u2019t know how much you want to spend, but I do have this pretty cool Aquaman statue.\nSheldon: Aquaman? Oh, this isn\u2019t a gag gift, Stuart.\nStuart: Yeah, just as well. It\u2019s a pretty rare piece. I\u2019d rather just sell it to a real collector.\nSheldon: I\u2019m a real collector. How rare is it?\nStuart: Oh, I shouldn\u2019t even have mentioned it. How about a Batman squirt gun?\nSheldon: Don\u2019t try and trick me into buying something I don\u2019t want. Now let\u2019s talk Aquaman. \nHoward: What were they thinking, putting Doctor Octopus\u2019s mind in Spider-Man\u2019s body?\nRaj: Well, I\u2019ve been quite enjoying that. It combines all the superhero fun of Spider-Man with all the body-switching shenanigans of Freaky Friday. Both versions, original and Lohan.\nHoward: Both versions: original and Lohan. You\u2019re an idiot.\nRaj: Hey, what\u2019s your problem?\nHoward: I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019ve been kind of snippy lately. It\u2019s probably this stupid diet I\u2019m on.\nRaj: Why are you on a diet?\nHoward: I\u2019ve put on a couple pounds. Had to buy these pants in the men\u2019s section.\nRaj: Well, we\u2019ve all seen your mom. That Butterball turkey was bound to come home to roost.\nSheldon: Twelve hundred dollars. That\u2019s my final offer.\nStuart: All right, Sheldon, you win. I\u2019m sure Leonard is gonna love this.\nSheldon: Oh, right, a present for Leonard. You better throw in that squirt gun.\nStuart: Ooh, yeah, I don\u2019t know. This squirt gun, it\u2019s, uh, it\u2019s pretty rare.\nSheldon: Oh.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment. \nLeonard: And this is me doing the Titanic pose on the boat.\nPenny: Ah.\nLeonard: And, oh, that\u2019s me getting rescued after I fell in.\nPenny: Oh. (Knock on door) Oh, that\u2019s the pizza.\nLeonard: Yep. Here\u2019s some money.\nPenny: Thank you.\nLeonard: And I\u2019m gonna hit the head. That\u2019s what us salty sea dogs say when we have to go pee-pee.\nPenny: Hey.\nPizza guy: Twenty-two fifty.\nPenny: Okay, here\u2019s, uh, twenty-five. Keep the change.\nPizza guy: Seriously? I just walked up, like, four flights of stairs.\nPenny: Oh. Okay. Well, here\u2019s, um, thirty something cents and a promise I won\u2019t call your boss and tell him you reek of marijuana.\nSheldon: Oh, Penny, I see you\u2019ve ordered pizza. I have Chinese food. \nPenny: That\u2019s nice.\nSheldon: Oh, that\u2019s a rather earthy cologne. My uncle used to wear that. Perhaps we can enjoy one last meal together before Leonard returns.\nPenny: Yeah, thanks, but I kind of feel like eating alone tonight, so\u2026\nSheldon: Are you sure? With your Italian pizza and my Chinese noodles, we could play Marco Polo. I mean, of course, a re-enactment of a meal in the life of Marco Polo the Venetian explorer, not Marco Polo the terrifying water sport.\nPenny: Uh, yeah, it sounds fun, but no thanks. (Toilet flushes) Have a good night!\nSheldon: What, now, do you have company?\nPenny: No. No, no, no. You know what? The toilet\u2019s been doing that. I called the building manager, so\u2026\nSheldon: Oh, I can take a look at it.\nPenny: Well\u2026\nSheldon: I\u2019m quite familiar with plumbing. Not to brag, but I spent most of fifth grade with my head in a toilet.\nPenny: Yeah, no, no, no. You know what, Sheldon, it\u2019s okay. You don\u2019t have to go into the bathroom.\nSheldon: That\u2019s curious. If there\u2019s no one here, why are there two glasses of wine on the table?\nPenny: Oh. Well, you know, I, I\u2019ve got two hands and a bit of a drinking problem.\nSheldon: Of course. Ask a silly question. \nPenny: Oh. \nSheldon: That\u2019s odd.\nPenny: Um, what?\nSheldon: There are takeout containers in the trash can.\nPenny: So? That\u2019s my dinner from last night.\nSheldon: What\u2019s odd is they\u2019re in the trash can.\nPenny: Okay. Look, honey, I promise there\u2019s no one\u2019s here. I\u2018ve had a long day. I just want to have a quiet dinner by myself.\nSheldon: Oh, very well. I\u2019m no stranger to enjoying the pleasures of solitude. Oh!\nPenny: What?\nSheldon: Have you gotten Leonard a welcome-home gift yet?\nPenny: No.\nSheldon: Oh, great. Do you want to go halfsies on a two hundred dollar squirt gun?\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s apartment.\nBernadette: Hi, honey.\nHoward: Hey.\nBernadette: I made some brownies. You want one?\nHoward: You\u2019re kidding, right? I mean, you know I\u2019m trying to lose weight. God, I thought we were partners in this marriage.\nBernadette: We are. Stop it. And for the last time, you\u2019re not fat.\nHoward: Really? Tell that to the bathroom scale, \u2019cause one of you is lying.\nBernadette: Fine, forget I asked. How was dinner at your mom\u2019s?\nHoward: Awful. I had to rub her ointment all over her again.\nBernadette: Why can\u2019t she do it?\nHoward: \u2018Cause we\u2019ve got a deeply unhealthy relationship. Which reminds me, do you think you can get any samples of this from work? This was supposed to last her a month, but they didn\u2019t take into account the square footage of her back.\nBernadette: Let me see. How long have you been putting this on her?\nHoward: I don\u2019t know. Few weeks. Why?\nBernadette: This is really strong oestrogen cream. Please tell me you\u2019ve been wearing gloves.\nHoward: Like these swollen sausages could fit in gloves.\nBernadette: Howie, the oestrogen\u2019s getting absorbed by your skin. That\u2019s why you\u2019ve been all bloated and moody and a giant pain in the ass. \nHoward: You\u2019re full of oestrogen and you don\u2019t act like that.\nBernadette: That\u2019s \u2019cause I\u2019m a woman. I\u2019ve had years of practice riding the dragon.\nHoward: Fine. I\u2019ll wear gloves next time.\nBernadette: It\u2019s still gonna take a few weeks for the hormones to leave your system.\nHoward: I feel so stupid. And fat.\nBernadette: It\u2019s okay. You still look great to me. In fact, why don\u2019t we go in the bedroom and I\u2019ll prove it to you?\nHoward: Sex? Really? I mean, that\u2019s just your solution to everything. \nScene: The apartment.\nAmy: Oh, and here\u2019s a fun thing. I worked it out so that there are two different words for spoon, planko and janko. Planko is a spoon with food, janko is a spoon without food. Janko is spelled with a silent ptang. Sheldon, you\u2019re not even listening to the rules of my made-up language.\nSheldon: Yes, I am.\nAmy: Then what does tweepadock mean?\nSheldon: Uh, elephant?\nAmy: Lucky guess.\nSheldon: I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m just distracted by something that happened over at Penny\u2019s.\nAmy: What happened?\nSheldon: I fear Penny is being unfaithful to Leonard.\nAmy: What?\nSheldon: She claimed to be alone when there was obviously someone else in her apartment. I have no choice but to assume the worst, given Leonard\u2019s lengthy sea voyage and her famously ravenous nether regions.\nAmy: I don\u2019t think Penny would cheat on Leonard.\nSheldon: Oh, really? She and I once had a staring contest. She clapped really loud and made me blink. It\u2019s a small leap from there to sexual infidelity.\nAmy: You\u2019re being ridiculous.\nSheldon: Amy, there were Chinese food containers in the trash can.\nAmy: Poor Leonard.\nScene: Sheldon and Amy listening at Penny\u2019s door.\nAmy: Do you hear anything?\nSheldon: I hear a woman\u2019s voice.\nAmy: Is it Penny?\nSheldon: No, it\u2019s you. All right, I hear whispering and giggling. Now I think I hear kissing.\nAmy: Yeah, like you know what kissing sounds like.\nSheldon: There\u2019s kissing in Star Trek, smarty-pants.\nAmy: Let me listen. Sounds like Leonard.\nSheldon: Please. Why would Leonard come home early and waste his time kissing Penny when he could be hanging out with his best buddy? Yeah, that\u2019s it. I\u2019m catching her in the act. (Unlocks door)\nAmy: No, Sheldon, don\u2019t.\nSheldon: Aha. \nPenny: What the hell?\nSheldon: Leonard?\nPenny: Sheldon, you cannot just barge in here like that. \nSheldon: Right. (Goes out.) (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. Are you going to answer the door or should I open it and say aha again?\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment. \nLeonard: I\u2019m sorry, Sheldon. I should\u2019ve told you I was back. I just wanted to have a couple days alone with Penny.\nSheldon: Oh, no, I should apologize. Uh, I never realized to what extent our friendship was a burden to you.\nLeonard: That is not fair. I complain about what a burden it is at least once a month.\nSheldon: Oh, no, no, let\u2019s not sugarcoat this. You find me finicky, pedantic and annoying.\nPenny: No, he doesn\u2019t.\nLeonard: I actually have used those exact words before. In that order.\nSheldon: Well, Leonard, I think it\u2019s high time you and I address the tweepadock in the room.\nLeonard: The what?\nSheldon: Amy?\nAmy: Please leave me out of this.\nSheldon: Fine. Leonard, there\u2019s no need for you to pretend to like me anymore.\nLeonard: Come on, I said I was sorry.\nSheldon: No, no, you save your apologies for after you\u2019ve had disappointing coitus with Penny.\nPenny: It was fine.\nLeonard: Come on, this is silly. Hey, um, I brought you back a little present from my trip, huh? It\u2019s that sailor cap that you wanted. It\u2019s neat, huh?\nSheldon: You honestly think you can buy back my friendship with a cheap souvenir?\nLeonard: I don\u2019t. I really don\u2019t. Just try it on. Oh, yeah.\nAmy: Hello, sailor.\nPenny: Ooh, now we\u2019re talking.\nSheldon: Excuse me. This changes nothing. Except the Halloween costume I\u2019m wearing this year. Amy, you\u2019re going to be Olive Oyl. Lay off the doughnuts.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s apartment.\nHoward: Thanks for coming over.\nRaj: No problem. Ooh, you made little sandwiches.\nHoward: Yeah, that\u2019s cucumber and cream cheese. That\u2019s turkey and loganberry. And don\u2019t tell my hips, but I\u2019m warming up a brie in the oven.\nRaj: Nice. So, mmm. What\u2019s up?\nHoward: Okay, well, I\u2019ve been reading up on all the side effects you can get from oestrogen, and, I need you to be honest with me. Do my boobs look bigger to you?\nRaj: Well, it\u2019s kind of hard to tell. \nHoward: Come on, Raj, it\u2019s a yes or no question.\nRaj: I\u2019m not sure. Um, wait. Jump up and down, let\u2019s see if they jiggle. Uh, no, I, I still can\u2019t tell, uh, oh, you know what? Okay, uh, give me some of this.\nHoward: Seriously?\nRaj: Do you want my help or not?\nHoward: Fine.\nRaj: Okay, yup. See, see, that, that looks like, that looks like they could be bigger. But you know, I bet, I bet when I do it, mine do the same thing.\nHoward: Yeah, they kind of do.\nRaj: Hmm. Uh, let me see something. (Grabs his boob)\nHoward: Hey, easy, my nipples are sensitive.\nRaj: Oh. Sorry, sorry, uh, okay. (Grabs boob again. Behind them, Bernadette walks in) I mean, yeah, maybe.\nHoward: Okay, let me feel. No, I am definitely up a cup size. \nRaj: You know, but, but they\u2019re very firm, so you\u2019ve got that going for you.\nHoward: You think?\nRaj: Yeah, yeah, yeah, very perky.\nHoward: Thank you. I really needed to hear that today. (Bernadette rolls eyes and walks out) Ooh, brie\u2019s ready.\nRaj: Yay.\nScene: The apartment. \nLeonard: Good morning.\nSheldon: Hello.\nLeonard: So am I driving you to work or are you still mad at me?\nSheldon: I\u2019d like a ride. Assuming you actually do take me to work.\nLeonard: Where do you think I would take you?\nSheldon: Who knows? Uh, you said you\u2019d be home yesterday, but you came home three days ago. You say you\u2019re taking me to work, but for all I know, I\u2019ll end up in a deserted amusement park. Or a cornfield maze. Or a back alley dog fight. You tell me.\nLeonard: I\u2019m going to work. You can come if you want.\nSheldon: Okay. By the way, you have something on your shirt.\nLeonard: No, I don\u2019t.\nSheldon: Hurts, doesn\u2019t it? You know, I find myself wondering if anything you\u2019ve ever told me is true.\nLeonard: I didn\u2019t make it back. The ship sank, I\u2019m in hell.\nSheldon: You say you\u2019re from New Jersey, but how can I believe you?\nLeonard: Why would anyone claim to be from New Jersey if they weren\u2019t?\nSheldon: All right, I\u2019ll give you that one.\nLeonard: Hey, I said I was sorry. What else do you want from me?\nSheldon: I want you to admit that what you did was wrong.\nLeonard: Fine. What I did was wrong.\nSheldon: I wish I could believe you.\nLeonard: You know what? I\u2019m not driving you to work, because you\u2019re incredibly annoying.\nSheldon: You say one thing and do the other, so then you are driving me and you find me a delight.\nLeonard: Stop it.\nSheldon: Keep it up?\nLeonard: Bye.\nSheldon: Hello. So I guess you\u2019re really holding up the other four fingers?\nScene: The stairwell.\nPenny: Oh, hey, what are you doing here so early?\nAmy: Driving Sheldon to work.\nPenny: He\u2019s still mad at Leonard, huh?\nAmy: Well, he\u2019s mad at you, too. He says you\u2019re the succubus who led his friend astray.\nPenny: I don\u2019t know what succubus is, but it has suck in it, so that can\u2019t be good.\nSheldon: Thought I heard you out here.\nPenny: Hey, Sheldon.\nSheldon: You don\u2019t get a hey. You get a hmm.\nPenny: Come on, don\u2019t be like that. We had so much fun together the last couple of months.\nSheldon: You\u2019re right. Which makes your betrayal all the more devastating.\nPenny: Sheldon.\nSheldon: I let you buy feminine hygiene products with my supermarket club card. You have any idea the kind of coupons I\u2019m going to get in the mail now?\nAmy: Sheldon, your fight\u2019s with Leonard. Penny\u2019s got nothing to do\u2026\nSheldon: Careful, Amy. The friend of my enemy\u2019s girlfriend is my enemy. \nAmy: Really?\nSheldon: Yes. You\u2019re either with me or against me.\nAmy: You want to take the bus to work?\nSheldon: Maybe there\u2019s a third option.\nAmy: FYI, I had a doughnut for breakfast, you jerk.\nScene: The cafeteria.\nLeonard: So now we\u2019re just waiting for the data from the ship to be crunched, but the numbers look pretty promising.\nHoward: That\u2019s so great. If you guys prove the existence of Unruh radiation\u2026 Hey, hey, hey, hey. My eyes are up here.\nSheldon: Howard, Raj. Judas.\nLeonard: You know what? You\u2019re a crazy person.\nSheldon: A crazy person with a long memory, and if all goes according to plan, a robot army.\nHoward: Stop it.\nSheldon: Or a mutant army. It depends on how my Kickstarter goes.\nHoward: I said, stop it. Now, listen to me. You two aren\u2019t just friends. You\u2019re best friends. And that\u2019s a beautiful thing. I mean, Leonard, you know why he\u2019s so mad at you? It\u2019s \u2019cause he missed you. Yeah, and as his friend, you should be happy he has love in his life. As I do. This man held my breast the other day and I love him for it.\nRaj: A little loud, dude.\nHoward: So, can we please put aside these petty differences and just be glad we\u2019re here together?\nLeonard: Okay.\nSheldon: I suppose so.\nHoward: Thank you.\nRaj: Uh, it wasn\u2019t anything weird. It was just to see how big they were.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: And then Leonard took me to the barber and the dentist, and then to cap off the perfect day, the Los Angeles Bureau of Weights and Measures. \nLeonard: I thought the measures were going to be the stars of the show, turns out it was the weights.\nPenny: I\u2019m so glad you guys are friends again.\nSheldon: And I\u2019m glad you and I are friends again, too.\nPenny: Aw.\nSheldon: Which reminds me. This came in the mail, and I want you to have it.\nPenny: Fifty cents off Vagisil.\nSheldon: Think of me when you apply it.\nRaj: Uh, can I just say, I\u2019ve missed all of us hanging out together.\nSheldon: Yeah.\nPenny: Me, too.\n\u00a0\nLeonard: Um, since when can Koothrappali talk in front of the girls without a beer?\n\u00a0\nBernadette: Oh, that happened right after you left.\n\u00a0\nLeonard: And no one told me?\n\u00a0\nHoward (crying): Can\u2019t believe we forgot to tell him.\n\u00a0\nPenny (handing Howard the Vagisil coupon): Think of Sheldon when you apply it.\n\u00a0\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "6_9": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The cafeteria.\nLeonard: They are not.\nRaj: They are, too.\nLeonard: Your hypothesis is completely disconfirmed by all the data. You\u2019re just clinging to it out of intellectual stubbornness.\nRaj: No, you\u2019re displaying a shocking ignorance of the subject matter. Mummies and zombies are the exact same thing.\nLeonard: Oh, yeah? Mummies are wrapped in bandages.\nRaj: That\u2019s called a fashion choice.\nLeonard: All right, you brought this on yourself. Sheldon, get him.\nSheldon: If a zombie bites you, you turn into a zombie. However, if a mummy bites you, all you turn into is some schmo with a mummy bite. So, like a zombie, that\u2019s been eaten from the waist down, you, sir, have no leg to stand on.\nLeonard: Good boy. Here\u2019s a cookie.\nSheldon: Oh, thank you.\nHoward: Hey, fellas, what\u2019s going on?\nLeonard: Oh, mummies and zombies again.\nHoward: Oh, they\u2019re not the same thing.\nLeonard: You get a cookie, too.\nHoward: Thanks. Guess who picked up his new car this morning?\nRaj: Congratulations. Does it have that new car smell?\nHoward: Yep. For as long as I can keep my mother out of it. If you want to check it out later, it\u2019s parked right out front, space 294.\nSheldon: I\u2019m sorry, 294?\nHoward: Yeah.\nSheldon: That\u2019s my parking spot.\nRaj: Why do you have a parking spot? You don\u2019t have a car. You don\u2019t even drive.\nSheldon: It doesn\u2019t matter. That\u2019s my spot.\nLeonard: Maybe they reassigned it because you never use it.\nSheldon: Well, I\u2019m not using my nipples, either. Maybe they should reassign those.\nHoward: Sheldon, someday, if you get a car, I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll give you another parking space.\nSheldon: I don\u2019t want another parking space. I want my parking space. It\u2019s perfect. It\u2019s a corner spot, cutting the risk of door-dings in half. It\u2019s a mere 28 steps from the building entrance. The nearby tree provides shade on hot days and is also home to a delightful squirrel. Which is fortuitous because most squirrels are real jerks.\nHoward: Fun story. Meanwhile, you still don\u2019t have a car.\nSheldon: Don\u2019t try to change the subject. This is about a parking space. It has nothing to do with cars.\nHoward: Are you listening to yourself?\nSheldon: I always listen to myself. It\u2019s one of the great joys of my life. Now, get your car out of my spot.\nHoward: Nope.\nSheldon: Very well. You leave me no choice.\nScene: The parking spot. Sheldon is trying to push Howard\u2019s car out of the spot.\nSheldon: What are you looking at, you stupid squirrel?\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon (on phone): President Siebert, listen to reason. Yeah, I understand I don\u2019t use the parking spot, but that\u2019s not the point. I\u2026 Yes, I\u2019m aware you told me not to call you at home, but you didn\u2019t answer the door. And I know you were there, because I saw you through the mail slot. Yeah, well, that\u2019s some salty language. May I remind you that you\u2019re the president of a major university, not the president of the Potty Mouth Club. There it is again. Do you kiss your mother with that mouth? Oh, well, I\u2019m sorry for your loss. Good night, sir. Unbelievable. He says Wolowitz deserves my spot because he\u2019s a high-profile asset to the university.\nLeonard: Well, he\u2019s not wrong. Howard did go to the International Space Station.\nSheldon: Yeah, that was five weeks ago. How much longer is he gonna milk that cow?\nLeonard: Sheldon, let it go. It\u2019s not a big deal.\nSheldon: No, no, this is a slippery slope, Leonard. It starts with a parking space, where does it end? It\u2019s like my dad always said, first they say you can\u2019t drink and drive, next thing you know, you can\u2019t let your 10-year-old take the wheel while you sleep one off in the backseat.\nLeonard: All that story does is make me feel bad for your mother.\nSheldon: Leonard, you\u2019re my best friend. Why don\u2019t you ever take my side?\nLeonard: Because I can never understand your side.\nScene: Sheldon\u2019s office.\nHoward: Give it back.\nSheldon: I\u2019m sorry, but could you be more specific?\nHoward: My Iron Man helmet. Koothrappali saw you take it. Give it back.\nSheldon: Oh, that. Well, see, I wanted it, and you weren\u2019t using it. Apparently, those are the rules we live by now. Payback, it truly is the B word, isn\u2019t it?\nHoward: Sheldon, that is a five hundred dollar limited edition collectible, and I want it back.\nSheldon: I\u2019d love to help you out, but unfortunately (puts helmet on), I\u2019m using it.\nHoward: Fine. I\u2019m taking your diploma.\nSheldon: Go ahead. That\u2019s the only doctorate you\u2019ll ever get. It smells funny in here.\nScene: The apartment stairwell.\nBernadette: We\u2019re so proud of you, Amy. Your first bikini wax.\nPenny: Yeah. So, how you doing?\nAmy: A little sensitive, but not bad. Does it always take that long?\nPenny: Uh, no, they usually don\u2019t have to go out and get more wax.\nAmy: I feel like I\u2019m five pounds lighter.\nBernadette: Really? Only five?\nPenny: Hey, anybody want a drink?\nAmy: Sure.\nBernadette: Okay. So, did you spend last night hearing about this silly parking space fight, too?\nAmy: For hours. Fortunately, I couldn\u2019t understand most of it \u2019cause Sheldon was wearing that stupid robot mask.\nBernadette: Howard was so angry I had to mash up Benadryl in his ice cream to get him to fall asleep.\nAmy: I guess this is what we get for being with two testosterone-fueled alpha males. At some point, they\u2019re bound to lock horns.\nPenny: I\u2019m assuming these are some kind of horns they bought at Comic-Con?\nBernadette: I\u2019m really sorry they took Sheldon\u2019s spot away. He shouldn\u2019t have to suffer just because Howard\u2019s such a big deal now.\nAmy: I know, Sheldon should just let Howard have his little moment in the sun.\nBernadette: What\u2019s that supposed to mean?\nAmy: Well, I mean, Howard\u2019s never gonna go to space again, but Sheldon will always be a genius.\nBernadette: You\u2019re right. And I\u2019m sure Sheldon will get a fancy parking spot again, if and when he makes a worthwhile contribution to science.\nAmy: If and when?\nPenny: Okay, maybe we should change the subject. Um, Amy, how are your lady parts? Still chilly down there?\nBernadette: Hang on. None of Sheldon\u2019s theories have ever been definitively proven. My husband actually went to outer space.\nAmy: That\u2019s an impressive accomplishment. He\u2019s now an inspiration to millions of Americans who know you don\u2019t have to be special or even qualified to go into space.\nPenny: You know, I remember the first time I got a bikini wax. My sister did it with melted Crayolas and duct tape. It\u2019s a bad idea.\nBernadette: Gosh, Amy. I\u2019m sensing a little hostility. Is it maybe because, like Sheldon\u2019s work, your sex life is also theoretical?\nPenny: Damn.\nAmy: Yeah, well, at least when we do make love, Sheldon won\u2019t be thinking about his mother. And yes, that is a cleverly veiled reference to Howard\u2019s lifelong obsession to crawl back into her spacious womb.\nPenny: Anyway, to this day, I still can\u2019t see a box of crayons without crossing my legs.\nBernadette: I don\u2019t have to take this. I\u2019m gonna go home and have sex with my husband right now. Maybe I\u2019ll let him do it to me in the parking spot. Which sounds dirty, but I didn\u2019t mean it that way,\nScene: The stairwell.\nRaj: Okay, here\u2019s another one: If a zombie bites a vampire, and the vampire bites a human, does the human become a vampire or a zombie? Or a zompire?\nLeonard: Sheldon?\nSheldon: Cookie.\nLeonard: I don\u2019t have any.\nSheldon: Well, I\u2019m not giving it away. (Enters apartment. Howard is sitting naked in his spot with a laptop on his lap)\nHoward: Hi Sheldon.\nSheldon: He\u2019s in my spot. Leonard, make him stop being naked in my spot.\nLeonard: Howard, what are you doing?\nHoward: He wasn\u2019t using it. And I needed a nice cool piece of leather to wiggle my naked ass on.\nSheldon: Get off there.\nHoward: Give me back my Iron Man helmet.\nSheldon: Give me back my parking space.\nHoward: You don\u2019t need a parking space. You don\u2019t have a car.\nSheldon: You don\u2019t need an Iron Man helmet. You\u2019re not Iron Man.\nHoward: Well, we appear to have reached an impasse. And you know, I have to say, I thought you\u2019d be more upset that your laptop is sitting on my junk.\nRaj: I didn\u2019t pick up on that. That\u2019s a nice touch.\nLeonard: Mmm.\nScene: The parking spot. Sheldon is spraypainting out Howard\u2019s name and replacing it with his own.\nAmy: This is so exciting. I\u2019m feeling all tingly. Although that could just be my newly defoliated bikini zone.\nSheldon: Keep a lookout. This place is swarming with campus security. They will not hesitate to scold us.\nAmy: Freaking pigs.\nSheldon: Oh, yeah. Okay, now, pull your car into the spot and let\u2019s get out of here.\nAmy: Wait, I\u2019m leaving my car here?\nSheldon: Yes, and be sure and put on the emergency brake. Really makes these things tough to budge.\nAmy: Before I park, come in the back seat. I want to show you something I had done today.\nSheldon: All right, colour me intrigued.\nAmy: What do you think?\nSheldon: I think you\u2019re high on paint fumes. And boy, that\u2019s a lot of Band-Aids.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s apartment.\nPenny: Okay, Howard\u2019s mother is in, like, every one of your wedding photos.\nBernadette: What can I tell ya? She\u2019s a big girl. Wherever you look, there she is. More coffee?\nPenny: No, Leonard\u2019s taking me to a physics lecture, and coffee\u2019ll just keep me awake. (Knock on door) Oh, I\u2019ll get it.\nAmy: Oh, looks like someone\u2019s on Team Bernadette. Where\u2019s Howard?\nBernadette: He\u2019s not here. What\u2019s wrong?\nAmy: He had my car towed. It cost me two hundred dollars to get it back.\nBernadette: Oh, no. Where was it parked?\nAmy: In Sheldon\u2019s spot.\nBernadette: That doesn\u2019t make sense. Sheldon doesn\u2019t have a spot. Was it maybe in Howard\u2019s spot?\nAmy: Don\u2019t play dumb with me, sister. You tell your husband he owes me two hundred dollars.\nBernadette: Well, that doesn\u2019t make sense, either.\nAmy: Why not?\nBernadette: Because I\u2019m the one who had it towed.\nAmy: You?\nBernadette: Didn\u2019t see that one coming, did ya?\nAmy: Oh, yeah? Well, you\u2019re not gonna see this coming. (Swings handbag. Bernadette ducks. Penny is hit in the face)\nPenny: Ow! Ow!\nAmy: Oh, my God,\nBernadette: Are you okay?!\nPenny: You idiot, what the hell do you have in there?!\nAmy: Just my wallet, keys and a coffee can full of change I\u2019ve been meaning to take to the bank.\nBernadette: Don\u2019t move. I\u2019ll get some ice.\nAmy: Are you okay?\nPenny: Get away from me or I swear to God I will rip out what\u2019s left of your pubes!\nBernadette: Here.\nPenny: Thanks. Ah!\nBernadette: Amy, you think maybe this has gotten a little out of hand?\nPenny: Gee, you think?\nAmy: I do. Penny, Bernadette and I are sorry.\nBernadette: You hit her! What did I do?\nAmy: You had my car towed.\nBernadette: You were parked in Howard\u2019s spot.\nAmy: I was parked in Sheldon\u2019s spot.\nBernadette: Sheldon doesn\u2019t have a spot.\nPenny: Guys, I think I need to go to the emergency room.\nBernadette: Okay, let\u2019s go.\nAmy: I\u2019ll drive. You can see where the tow truck scratched my car.\nBernadette: The tow truck didn\u2019t scratch your car.\nAmy: How do you know?\nBernadette: \u2018Cause I did it!\nScene: The parking spot. Sheldon has set up his office in it.\nSheldon: Morning, Professor Stevens. Don\u2019t look at that whiteboard. That\u2019s my math, not your math. Keep walking, nosey.\nHoward: What the hell are you doing?\nSheldon: Oh. You said I\u2019m not using my space, so I\u2019m using it.\nHoward: Okay, you need to move now.\nSheldon: No, I don\u2019t.\nHoward: You can\u2019t stay there forever.\nSheldon: Actually, I have a plastic baggy strapped to my leg that says I can. Give up, Wolowitz. You\u2019ve chosen to tangle with a superior intellect you can\u2019t defeat. There is nothing you could possibly do to\u2026 (Howard starts sounding his horn. Sheldon puts on earphones)\nHoward: Those aren\u2019t gonna help you, Sheldon,\nSheldon: Oh, yes, they are. I mean, what?\nHoward: I\u2019m warning you, Sheldon!\nSheldon: Your threats are empty, nothing can move me. (Howard starts pushing his chair with the front of the car) Stop that.\nHoward: Get out of my spot.\nSheldon: No. That\u2019s it. I am calling campus security. You prepare for the scolding of your life.\nLeonard: What are you idiots doing?\nSheldon: He\u2019s trying to kill me, Leonard. Video games and rock music have desensitized him to violence.\nHoward: Would you please talk some sense into your lunatic roommate?\nLeonard: You\u2019re both acting like lunatics. It\u2019s just a parking spot.\nHoward: It\u2019s not just a parking spot. He can\u2019t handle the fact that I\u2019m a bigger deal than he is now.\nSheldon: Oh, preposterous. I have been solely responsible for this university\u2019s six loop quantum gravity calculations, I have changed the way we think about Bose-Einstein condensates, and I am also the one who got Nutter Butters in the cafeteria vending machine. Maybe you missed that news while you were floating around like a goof in outer space. Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I have work to do.\nHoward: Can you believe this guy?\nLeonard: What I don\u2019t believe is that you tried to run him over.\nHoward: Oh, like you\u2019ve never thought of doing that. Don\u2019t hate me just because I lived the dream. (Horn beeps. Sheldon is sitting naked in Howard\u2019s car.) \nSheldon: Hey, sweet ride.\nHoward: What are you doing in there?\nSheldon: Just breaking in your new car.\nHoward: Stop that. You stop that.\nSheldon: You know what they say? Revenge is a dish best served nude.\nScene: Sheldon\u2019s office.\nRaj: Hey, got a minute?\nSheldon: Oh, of course, come in. (Raj opens door to reveal Howard) This is an authentic Chinese throwing star, and I must warn you, I have seen many people throw them in movies.\nRaj: Calm down. Howard has something he wants to say to you.\nHoward: All right. Sheldon, when this whole thing with the parking space started, I had no idea just how much of a crazy bastard\u2026\nRaj: Howard, that\u2019s not how we practiced it.\nHoward: I had no idea how much that spot meant to you. Anyway, I called President Siebert and told him it\u2019s not worth fighting over the spot, so you keep it, and I\u2019ll park in the structure across the street.\nSheldon: Well, Howard, thank you. It\u2019s quite a gesture on your part. You\u2019ve shown yourself to be the bigger man.\nHoward: Thank you.\nSheldon: Which I find totally unacceptable. I must be the bigger man. Therefore, you may use my spot until such time as I learn to drive or get a Batmobile.\nHoward: Wow, okay. Well, thanks. I don\u2019t know what to say.\nSheldon: There is nothing to say. Except I\u2019m the bigger man. I\u2019m not kidding. Say it.\nRaj: Just say it.\nHoward: You\u2019re the bigger man, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Oh, stop. And I believe this is yours. FYI, if you wear that into a bank, they will tackle you to the ground.\nScene: The cheesecake factory.\nHoward: I\u2019d like to propose a toast, to burying the hatchet.\nSheldon: To burying the hatchet.\nBernadette: You know, I\u2019m kind of glad this happened.\nAmy: Me, too. In some weird way, I kind of feel like it brought us closer.\nPenny (with two black eyes and a plaster across her nose): Yeah, everybody\u2019s happy, great.\nScene: A dry cleaners.\nShopkeeper: Can I help you?\nSheldon: Yes. According to information I gleaned from Yelp, you had great success when a santeriasuzy37 brought you a pair of leather slacks stained with chicken blood. I believe I may have a similar problem. This cushion experienced a nude revenge wiggle.\nShopkeeper: A what?\nSheldon: A naked man sat on it. Now, here\u2019s my concern, his diet is rich in fatty deli meats. What test do you have to detect lipid residue?\nShopkeeper: Lipid what?\nSheldon: Lipid residue. An anal autograph. A colon calling card, if you will.\nShopkeeper: Tuesday okay?\nSheldon: Don\u2019t rush it. We may be dealing with befoulment on a molecular level.\nShopkeeper: Let me write you a ticket.\nSheldon: Is that your son?\nShopkeeper: Uh-huh.\nSheldon: Looks like that laptop\u2019s seen better days. If you\u2019re interested, I\u2019m selling this. It\u2019s only two years old, 16 gigabytes of RAM, Intel core i7 processor, and I can personally guarantee it has spent less than 20 minutes resting on an astronaut\u2019s penis.\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "3_9": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: Outside an apartment building.\nHoward: So two years later, there\u2019s a knock on the door, guy opens it, and there on his porch is the snail, who says, \u201cWhat the heck was all that about?\u201d\nBernadette: I don\u2019t really get it.\nHoward: Well, see, it took two years for the snail to\u2026 (she kisses him) not important.\nBernadette: Can I ask you a question?\nHoward: Sure.\nBernadette: Where do you think this is going?\nHoward: To be honest, I was hoping at least second base.\nBernadette: You\u2019re so funny. You\u2019re like a stand-up comedian.\nHoward: A Jewish stand-up comedian, that\u2019d be new.\nBernadette: Actually, I think a lot of them are Jewish.\nHoward: No, I was just\u2026 never mind.\nBernadette: Look, Howard, this is our third date and we both know what that means.\nHoward: We do?\nBernadette: Sex.\nHoward: You\u2019re kidding.\nBernadette: But I need to know whether you\u2019re looking for a relationship or a one-night stand.\nHoward: Okay, just to be clear, there\u2019s only one correct answer, right? It\u2019s not like chicken or fish on an airplane?\nBernadette: Maybe you need to think about it a little.\nHoward: You know, it\u2019s not unheard of for a one-night stand to turn into a relationship.\nBernadette: Call me when you figure it out.\nHoward: Three dates means sex? Who knew?\nScene: The apartment.\nHoward: Greetings, homies, homette.\nPenny: Why are you back from your date so early?\nHoward: In romance, as in show business, always leave them wanting more.\nPenny: What exactly does that mean?\nLeonard: He struck out.\nCredits sequence. \n \nScene: The university cafeteria.\nHoward: Hey, did either of you guys know that three dates with the same woman is the threshold for sex?\nRaj: Actually, I\u2019ve never had three dates with the same woman.\nLeonard: With Penny and me, it took two years. Now that I think about it, that was three dates.\nHoward: Okay, well, before you and Penny hooked up, did she ask for any kind of commitment?\nLeonard: No, she was pretty clear about wanting to keep her options open.\nSheldon (arriving): I have something to announce, but out of respect for convention, I will wait for you to finish your current conversation. What are you talking about?\nLeonard: The cultural paradigm in which people have sex after three dates.\nSheldon: I see. Now, are we talking date, the social interaction, or date, the dried fruit?\nLeonard: Never mind, what\u2019s your announcement?\nSheldon: Oh, good, my turn. Well, this is very exciting and I wanted you to be among the first to know\u2026\nKripke: Hey, Cooper, I hear you\u2019re going to be on the wadio with Ira Fwatow from Science Fwiday next week.\nSheldon: Thank you, Kripke, for depriving me of the opportunity to share my news with my friends.\nKripke: My pweasure.\nSheldon: My thank you was not sincere.\nKripke: But my pweasure is. Let me ask you a question, at what point did National Public Wadio have to start scwaping the bottom of the bawwel for its guests? Eh, don\u2019t answer, it\u2019s wetowical.\nSheldon: Why are you such a stupid head? That is also rhetorical. I\u2019m sorry you had to hear that.\nLeonard: Are you really going to be on NPR?\nSheldon: Yes, they\u2019re interviewing me by phone from my office, regarding the recent so-called discovery of magnetic monopoles in spin-ices. It\u2019s pledge week and they\u2019re trying to goose the ratings with a little controversy.\nLeonard: Very cool, congratulations.\nSheldon: Thank you. My mother is very excited. She\u2019s convening her Bible study group to listen in, and then pray for my soul.\nRaj: I was on the radio once. I called in to Fever 104 FM New Delhi and was the fourth person to say the phrase that pays, \u201cFever 104, \u092c\u0939\u0941\u0924 \u0905\u091a\u094d\u091b\u093e \u0938\u0902\u0917\u0940\u0924 \u0915\u0947 \u092e\u094c\u091c\u0942\u0926\u093e \u0918\u0930.\u201d That means: \u201cFever 104, home of the really good current music.\u201d It\u2019s much catchier in Hindi.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: All right. These are the talking points for my NPR interview tomorrow. I need to make sure that they\u2019re simple enough for the less educated in the audience to understand. Howard, look this over and tell me what\u2019s unclear to you.\nHoward: Excuse me, I have a master\u2019s degree in engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It required the completion of 144 units of grad work and an original thesis.\nSheldon: Yes. Look this over and tell me what\u2019s unclear to you.\nLeonard: You know, when Sheldon gives you homework, you don\u2019t have to do it.\nRaj: In fact, it\u2019s better if you don\u2019t, otherwise it makes the rest of us look bad.\nPenny: Hi, guys.\nLeonard: Hey.\nSheldon: Hello.\nPenny: Yo, Raj, talk to me. I\u2019m sorry, just screwing with you. Hey, Howard, why haven\u2019t you called Bernadette?\nHoward: Did she say something?\nPenny: Yeah, she said she hasn\u2019t heard from you in a week. I thought you liked her?\nHoward: I do, yeah, but she wants a commitment and I\u2019m not sure she\u2019s my type.\nPenny: She agreed to go out with you for free. What more do you need?\nHoward: Look, Bernadette is really nice. I just always thought when I finally settle down into a relationship, it would be with someone, you know, different.\nPenny: Different how?\nHoward: Well, you know, more like Megan Fox from Transformers, or Katee Sackhoff from Battlestar Galactica.\nPenny: Are you high?\nLeonard: You\u2019d have a better shot with the three-breasted Martian hooker from Total Recall.\nHoward: Okay, now you\u2019re just being unrealistic. Anyway, that movie was like 20 years ago, imagine how saggy those things would be.\nPenny: Howard, you\u2019re going to throw away a great girl like Bernadette because you\u2019re holding out for some ridiculous fantasy?\nHoward: Hey, just because you settled doesn\u2019t mean I have to.\nLeonard: Excuse me, I\u2019m sitting here.\nPenny: Hey, I did not settle for Leonard. I mean, obviously, he isn\u2019t the kind of guy I usually go out with, you know, physically.\nLeonard: Again, I\u2019m right here.\nPenny: My point is, I do not judge a book by its cover. I am interested in the person underneath.\nLeonard: I am here, right? You see me.\nHoward: Hey, I\u2019m interested in what\u2019s inside people, too, but why is it wrong to want those insides wrapped up in, say, the delicious caramel that is Halle Berry? (To Raj) Yes, you\u2019re delicious caramel, too.\nPenny: All right, you know what, I will tell you why it\u2019s wrong\u2026\nSheldon: Excuse me, may I interject?\nPenny: What?\nSheldon: Biologically speaking, Howard is perfectly justified in seeking out the optimum mate for the propagation of his genetic line.\nHoward: Thank you, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Now, whether that propagation is in the interest of humanity is, of course, an entirely different question.\nScene: Kripke is in a storage cupboard of some kind. He has tubes rigged up through the roof attached to helium tanks which he is turning on. The radio is playing. \nRadio: This is Ira Flatow and you\u2019re listening to NPR\u2019s Science Friday. Joining us today by phone from his office in Pasadena, California is Dr. Sheldon Cooper.\nKripke: Oh, this is going to be a wiot.\nScene switches to Sheldon\u2019s office, where the end of the tubing can be seen coming through the wall. Hissing can be heard.\nRadio: Thanks for being with us today, Dr. Cooper.\nSheldon: My pleasure, Ira.\nIra: Now, let\u2019s talk about magnetic monopoles. Can you explain to our audience just what a monopole is?\nSheldon: Of course. First, consider an ordinary magnet which has, (the pitch of his voice begins to rise) as even the most uneducated in your audience must know, two poles, (pitch rises further) a north and south pole. If you cut that in half, you have two smaller magnets, each with its own north and south pole.\nIra: Uh, Dr. Cooper, I think there might be something wrong with our connection.\nSheldon (even higher pitch): No, I hear you fine. As I was saying, an ordinary magnet has two poles. The primary characteristic of a monopole is that it has only one pole, hence, monopole.\nScene cuts to university cafeteria where Kripke is holding up the radio for all to listen. \nSheldon: A requirement for string theory, or M-theory, if you will, is the existence of such monopoles. I, myself, led an expedition to the Arctic Circle in search of said particles. Kripke, I found the nozzle! I\u2019m going to kill you!\nScene: Howard\u2019s bathroom. He is in the bath.\nHoward: So nice you could join me this evening. You\u2019re looking lovely as always.\nKatee Sackhoff: Thanks, Howard. Always nice to be part of your masturbatory fantasies.\nHoward: Come on, Katee, don\u2019t make it sound so cheap.\nKatee: I\u2019m sorry, fiddling with yourself in the bathtub is a real class act.\nHoward: Thank you. So, shall we get started?\nKatee: Sure. But can I ask you a question first?\nHoward: You want to play Cylon and colonist?\nKatee: No. I want to know why you\u2019re playing make-believe with me when you could be out with a real woman tonight.\nHoward: You mean, Bernadette?\nKatee: No, I mean Princess Leia. Of course I mean Bernadette. She\u2019s a wonderful girl and she really likes you.\nHoward: I know, but she\u2019s not you.\nKatee: I\u2019m not me. The real me is in Beverly Hills going out with a tall, handsome, rich guy.\nHoward: Really? Tall?\nKatee: Six-four.\nHoward: Ouch.\nKatee: The point is, you\u2019ve got a wonderful girl in your life, and you\u2019re ignoring her in order to spend your nights in the bathtub with a mental image and a wash cloth.\nHoward\u2019s Mother: Howard! What are you doing in there?\nHoward: I\u2019m taking a bath!\nHoward\u2019s Mother: I hope that\u2019s all you\u2019re doing! We share that tub!\nHoward: Don\u2019t remind me! (Katee has vanished) Oh, man. All soaped up and no place to go.\nScene: Sheldon\u2019s bedroom. \nLeonard: How ya doin\u2019, buddy?\nSheldon: I was humiliated on national radio. How do you think I\u2019m doing?\nLeonard: Come on, it wasn\u2019t that bad.\nSheldon: What do you want?\nRaj (in a munchkin voice): We represent the Lollipop Guild, and we want you.\nLeonard: Okay, so Kripke played a joke on you.\nSheldon: It wasn\u2019t funny.\nRaj: I thought it was funny.\nLeonard: Raj.\nRaj: You laughed.\nSheldon: Did you laugh?\nLeonard: I fell on the floor. All right, he got you, you can get him back.\nSheldon: I refuse to sink to his level.\nRaj: You can\u2019t sink. With all that helium in you, you\u2019re lucky you don\u2019t float away.\nLeonard: Are you really admitting defeat?\nSheldon: I never admit defeat.\nLeonard: Good.\nSheldon: However, on an unrelated topic, I am never getting out of this bed again.\nLeonard: What if you could make Kripke look even sillier than he made you look?\nRaj: I don\u2019t think that\u2019s possible, dude.\nLeonard: You\u2019re not helping.\nRaj: I didn\u2019t come to help, I came to mock.\nLeonard: Sheldon, what you need to do is figure out a way to exact vengeance on Kripke, like, uh, like, how the Joker got back at Batman for putting him in the Arkham Asylum for the Criminally Insane.\nRaj: That\u2019s true. He didn\u2019t just stay there and talk about his feelings with the other psychotic villains. He, he broke out and poisoned Gotham\u2019s water supply.\nSheldon: Well, I suppose I could poison Kripke.\nLeonard: No, no.\nSheldon: It\u2019s a simple matter. There are several toxic chemicals that\u2019d be untraceable in an autopsy.\nLeonard: Okay, uh, that\u2019s the spirit, but, um, let\u2019s dial it back to a non-lethal form of vengeance.\nSheldon: Oh! How about we put awhoopee cushion on his office chair? He\u2019ll sit down, it\u2019ll sound like he\u2019s flatulent, even though he\u2019s not.\nLeonard: Let\u2019s keep thinking.\nScene: The Cheesecake Factory. Howard enters.\nPenny: Oh, gee, you\u2019re too late. Scarlett Johansson and Wonder Woman were just in here trolling around for neurotic, little weasels.\nHoward: Yeah, I came to talk to Bernadette. She\u2019s working today, right?\nPenny: Yes, but I don\u2019t think she wants to see you.\nHoward: Why not?\nPenny: Come on, Howard. You hurt her feelings by not calling her all week. Plus, I\u2019ve kind of been talkin\u2019 some smack about ya.\nBernadette: Hello, Howard.\nHoward: Wait, Bernadette, I need to talk to you.\nBernadette: I can\u2019t now, I\u2019m working.\nHoward: This will only take a second. You asked me to think about where our relationship was going, and I did. Bernadette? Will you marry me?\nBernadette: Is this more comedy that I don\u2019t understand?\nHoward: No. I\u2019m serious. I\u2019m never going to find another girl like you who likes me and is, you know, real.\nBernadette: So, this isn\u2019t a joke?\nHoward: No.\nBernadette: Then you\u2019re insane.\nHoward: I prefer to think of myself as quirky.\nBernadette: Howard, we\u2019ve only been on three dates. We haven\u2019t even had sex yet.\nHoward: Fair enough. When\u2019s your break?\nBernadette: Wow. (Walks away)\nHoward: Don\u2019t you just hate when this happens?\nPenny: Wow.\nScene: The apartment kitchen.\nSheldon: All right, how\u2019s this for revenge? A solution of hydrogen peroxide, and one of saturated potassium iodide.\nRaj: What\u2019s this?\nSheldon: Mountain Dew. Ah, refreshing. Now, we\u2019re going to combine these chemicals with ordinary dish soap, creating a little exothermic release of oxygen.\nRaj: Foamy vengeance.\nSheldon: Yes, exactly.\nLeonard: This is brilliant, Sheldon. How are we going to deploy it in Kripke\u2019s office?\nSheldon: Already taken care of. Observe. This is a live shot of Kripke\u2019s lab via a mini webcam I was able to install, thanks to a dollar bill discreetly placed in the night janitor\u2019s shirt pocket. At the same time, I also secured large quantities of these chemicals above the tiles in the drop ceiling.\nRaj: Oh, Sheldon, you remind me of a young Lex Luthor.\nSheldon: You flatter me, sir.\nLeonard: Let me guess, motion sensors?\nSheldon: The reaction will be triggered when Kripke reaches the center of the room. Mwah, ha, ha.\nLeonard: I gotta say, I am really impressed. This is truly the Sheldon Cooper way to get even. (Sits down. There is a flatulent noise)\nSheldon: It may be low-tech, but I still maintain the whoopee cushion has comic validity.\nRaj: Here comes Kripke!\nLeonard: Who is that with him?\nRaj: I believe that\u2019s the president of the university.\nLeonard: And the board of directors. Abort! Abort!\nSheldon: There is no abort.\nRaj: Well, how could you not put in an abort?\nSheldon: I made a boo-boo, all right?\nKripke: I think the board will weally appweciate how well we\u2019re using that NSA gwant, Pwesident Seibert. Wight here we have a micwo-contwolled pwasma\u2026 (foam falls from the ceiling soaking everyone)\nRaj: Wow. Looks like the Ganges on laundry day.\nLeonard: At least they don\u2019t know it was you.\nSheldon (on Kripke\u2019s computer in the lab): Hello, Kripke. This classic prank comes to you from the malevolent mind of Sheldon Cooper. If you\u2019d like to see the look on your stupid face, this video is being instantly uploaded to YouTube. Oh, and a hat tip to Leonard Hofstadter and Raj Koothrappali for their support and encouragement in this enterprise.\nRaj: Well, I\u2019m going back to India. What\u2019s your plan?\nScene: The Cheesecake Factory.\n \nPenny: Hey, here\u2019s your tip from table seven.\nBernadette: Oh, thanks.\nPenny: Mm-hmm.\nHoward (on the stage, into a microphone): Testing. Check. Check two.\nBernadette: Oh, now what?\nPenny: You want me to throw him out?\nBernadette: No, that\u2019s okay.\nPenny: Are you sure? He\u2019s small. I bet I can get a nice, tight spiral on him.\nHoward: I want to dedicate this number to a great gal who I\u2019ve done wrong. (To the tune of the Four Tops song Bernadette)  Bernadette, I am so sorry for trying to propose to you, Bernadette, you found it creepy but that\u2019s just the kind of thing I do. I know now it was too soon to talk of love. It was just a crazy idea that came to me in my tub. But, Bernadette, give me one more chance, sweet Bernadette, I\u2019ll get the hang of this thing they call romance, sweet Bernadette, I dream to once again kiss your lips, sweet Bernadette. Sincerely yours, Howard Wolowitz, Bernadette\u2026\nPenny: Oh, I am so sorry.\nBernadette: Are you kidding? That\u2019s the most romantic thing anyone\u2019s ever done for me.\nHoward (still singing): \u2026Bernadette! Thank you, Cheesecake Factory!\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "4_11": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The apartment. \nRaj: Water Demon.\nHoward: Ice Dragon.\nLeonard: Lesser Warlord of Ka\u2019a.\nSheldon: Not so fast. Infinite Sheldon.\nLeonard: Infinite Sheldon?\nSheldon: Yes, Infinite Sheldon defeats all other cards and does not violate the rule against homemade cards because I made it at work.\nLeonard: Do you understand why people don\u2019t want to play with you?\nSheldon: No, although it\u2019s a question I\u2019ve been pondering since preschool.\nLeonard: Hey.\nZack: Hey.\nLeonard: Hey.\nPenny: Hey, your copy of Science magazine was in my mailbox.\nLeonard: Oh, thanks.\nPenny: Mm-hmm.\nZack: Check it out, all about planets this month.\nLeonard: That\u2019s an atom.\nZack: Agree to disagree. That\u2019s what I love about science, there\u2019s no one right answer.\nLeonard: So, you and Zack again, huh?\nPenny: Yeah, yeah, me and Zack again.\nZack: Were we here earlier?\nPenny: Okay, we should, we should go.\nZack: Ah, not yet. I want to talk science with the science dudes.\nHoward: Oh, and the science dudes want to talk science with you. What do you want to talk about, rocks, dinosaurs, our friend the beaver?\nZack: You know, I saw this great thing on the Discovery Channel. Turns out that if you kill a starfish, it\u2019ll just come back to life.\nSheldon: Was the starfish wearing boxer shorts? Because you might have been watching Nickelodeon.\nZack: No, I\u2019m almost sure that it was the Discovery Channel. It was a great show. They also said dolphins might be smarter than people.\nLeonard: They might be smarter than some people.\nZack: Well, maybe we can do an experiment to find out.\nSheldon: Oh, that\u2019s easy enough. We\u2019d need a large tank of water, a hoop to jump through, and a bucket of whatever bite-sized treats you find tasty.\nZack: I don\u2019t get it.\nLeonard: A dolphin might.\nZack: Oh, I see. You guys are inferring that I\u2019m stupid.\nSheldon: That\u2019s not correct. We were implying it. You then inferred it.\nZack: Let\u2019s go.\nPenny: You know, for a group of guys who claim they spent most of their lives being bullied, you can be real jerks. Shame on all of you. (Closes door)\nRaj: What the hell did I do?\nPenny (Opens door again): You laughed.\nScene: The same.\n \nLeonard: You think Penny\u2019s right? Were we bullying Zack?\nHoward: No, I know bullying. He left here unswirlied and his ass crack was underpants-free.\nRaj: And nobody drew a penis on his forehead.\nLeonard: That happened to you?\nRaj: First day of cricket camp. They drew it so the testicles were my eyes.\nLeonard: I don\u2019t know, I think we might owe the guy an apology.\nHoward: So go apologize.\nLeonard: Why me?\nHoward: You started it, we just piled on.\nLeonard: What would I even say?\nSheldon: Zack, I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re stupid. Have a Milk Dud.\nRaj: A Milk Dud?\nSheldon: Yeah, Milk Duds, with their self-deprecating name and remarkably mild flavour, are the most apologetic of the boxed candies.\nLeonard: I got a better idea. We\u2019re all responsible. I say we all go. Come on, who\u2019s with me? Free comic books to anyone who comes with me. I might get punched. You really want to miss that?\nRaj: Junior Mints are pretty apologetic.\nSheldon: You\u2019re embarrassing yourself.\nScene: At Penny\u2019s door. Leonard knocks three times. \nSheldon: Penny.\nPenny: What?\nLeonard: Yeah, we came to talk to Zack. Hey, Zack.\nZack: What do you want?\nLeonard: Listen, uh, the stuff we were saying before, we were just kidding around.\nZack: No, you weren\u2019t. You were making fun of me.\nLeonard: Come on, that\u2019s what we do. We give each other a hard time. Hey, Sheldon, you look like a praying mantis.\nSheldon: That\u2019s very hurtful.\nLeonard: See?\nZack: I don\u2019t know, it still wasn\u2019t very nice.\nSheldon: Milk Dud?\nZack: Oh, I love Milk Duds. Okay, we\u2019re cool.\nSheldon (to Raj): Junior Mints.\nZack: You guys want to come in and have a beer?\nLeonard: Uh, we\u2019re on our way to the comic book store.\nHoward: Leonard\u2019s buying.\nZack: Really? I haven\u2019t been to a comic book store in literally a million years.\nSheldon: Literally? Literally a million years?\nLeonard: Don\u2019t.\nZack: You want to go with \u2019em?\nPenny: No.\nZack: Okay, see you later.\nPenny: Wait, w-w-wait-wait-wait, you\u2019re ditching me to go look at comic books?\nZack: Are you mad at me?\nPenny: I\u2019m not happy.\nZack: Milk Dud?\nScene: The comic book store.\nZack: Wow, this place is awesome. Where do they keep the Archies?\nSheldon: In the bedrooms of ten-year-old girls, where they belong.\nZack: Oh, no, you\u2019re thinking old-school Archie. It\u2019s much more sophisticated now. Like, there\u2019s two universes, and Archie\u2019s married to Betty in one and Veronica in the other. Midge is even breaking up with Moose.\nRaj: No.\nZack: About time, right?\nStuart: Hey.\nZack: Hey.\nStuart: You guys finally chip in for a bodyguard?\nLeonard: Uh, no. Oh, this is Zack. He\u2019s a friend of ours. Zack, this is Stuart. He owns the store.\nZack: Wow, lucky you.\nStuart: Yeah, I work 70 hours a week and average a dollar sixty five an hour.\nZack: Sweet.\nStuart: Is that sarcasm?\nHoward: Uh, no, it\u2019s an indictment of the American education system.\nRaj: The Archies are over here.\nZack: Yippee.\nStuart: So are you guys coming to my New Year\u2019s Eve costume party?\nSheldon: Of course. We\u2019re coming as the Justice League of America.\nHoward: Switching it up from last year when we came as the Justice League of America.\nSheldon: To that point, it occurs to me that we might have an opportunity to finally snare Best Group Costume if we shore up our weak link, which is clearly Leonard as Superman.\nLeonard: Hey, I got new boots this year. Guaranteed to add three inches.\nSheldon: That\u2019s sad. Let\u2019s ask ourselves, is there anyone we know who would make a more manly and convincing son of Krypton?\nStuart: Than than Leonard in high-heeled boots? Howard\u2019s mother in high-heeled boots?\nSheldon: I was thinking specifically of the gentleman over there moving his lips as he enjoys the latest exploits of Betty and Veronica.\nLeonard: Zack?\nHoward: He is the only person we know with actual muscles.\nLeonard: You can\u2019t replace me with Zack.\nSheldon: Why not? Penny did it.\nHoward: Yeah, she seems happier. Why wouldn\u2019t we be?\nZack: Score. I got an Archie, Betty and Veronica, and a Jughead. All set for my weekend number twos.\nSheldon: Congratulations. Zack, how would you like to be Superman?\nZack: I don\u2019t know, sounds like a lot of responsibility.\nScene: The stairwell. \n \nLeonard: Fine, if Zack\u2019s going to be Superman, I want to be Green Lantern.\nRaj: But I\u2019m Green Lantern.\nLeonard: You can be Aquaman.\nRaj: I don\u2019t want to be Aquaman. He sucks. He sucks underwater. He sucks fish pee.\nSheldon: Excuse me, I believe Aquaman uses his telepathic powers to request the fish do their business elsewhere.\nZack: Hey, babe.\nPenny: I\u2019m still mad at you.\nZack: Well, you won\u2019t be when you hear the great news.\nPenny: What great news?\nZack: We\u2019re going to a costume party at the comic book store on New Year\u2019s Eve, and you get to be Wonder Woman.\nSheldon: Complete with bulletproof bracelets and lasso of truth. Invisible plane sold separately.\nPenny: Wait, why me? Wh-Why can\u2019t your girlfriend be Wonder Woman?\nHoward: She and her lab team are under quarantine. Seems at the Christmas party they were doing Jell-O shots out of petri dishes that used to contain yellow fever.\nPenny: Okay, what about your friend Amy?\nSheldon: Amy Farrah Fowler doesn\u2019t believe in wearing costumes. She isn\u2019t the free spirit I am.\nPenny: Okay, well, forget it. I\u2019m not spending my New Year\u2019s Eve at a comic book store wearing a Wonder Woman costume.\nHoward (after Raj whispers to him): He says he\u2019ll wear it if you\u2019ll be Aquaman.\nScene: The apartment. Leonard is dressed as Green Lantern, Sheldon as The Flash. \nLeonard: What are you doing?\nSheldon: We\u2019re going to be late. I\u2019m pacing nervously.\nLeonard: You\u2019re jogging.\nSheldon: This is how the Flash paces.\nLeonard; Just chill out, Sheldon.\nSheldon: I\u2019m not Sheldon. I\u2019m the Flash. And now I\u2019m going to the Grand Canyon to scream in frustration. I\u2019m back.\nHoward: I\u2019m Batman.\nSheldon: Oh, I hardly think so. The real caped crusader calls his crime-fighting cohorts when he\u2019s running late.\nHoward: I had to walk. I couldn\u2019t get Raj on the back of my scooter.\nRaj: I\u2019ve said this before, and I\u2019ll say it again. Aquaman sucks.\nZack: Look up in the sky. It\u2019s a bird. It\u2019s a plane. I forget the rest.\nPenny: All right. Let\u2019s get this thing over with.\nSheldon: I\u2019m sorry. But in what universe is Wonder Woman blonde?\nHoward: Relax. No one\u2019s going to be looking at her hair. Ow! I mean, ow.\nZack: Hold on. The costume came with a black wig. Where is it, babe?\nPenny: No. I\u2019m not wearing it. It looks stupid.\nZack: Come on. We\u2019re trying to win a contest here.\nPenny: Forget it. I\u2019m not wearing the wig.\nZack: Penny, there\u2019s no I in Justice League.\nHoward: Well, actually.\nSheldon: Don\u2019t. He\u2019s making our case.\nZack: Okay, babe. Uh, kind of embarrassing me in front of my friends.\nPenny: Okay. You know what? I changed my mind. I\u2019m not going.\nRaj: Looks like someone else is going to have to be Wonder Woman.\nScene: Penny\u2019s door. \nZack: Babe, open up.\nPenny: I\u2019m not talking to you.\nZack: Then who are you talking to? Babe?\nSheldon:\u00a0 (Knock) Penny, (Knock) Penny, (Knock) Penny, (Knock) Penny, (Knock) Penny, (Knock) Penny, (Knock) Penny, (Knock) Penny, (Knock) Penny, (Knock) Penny, (Knock) Penny, (Knock) Penny, (Knock) Penny, (Knock) Penny, (Knock) Penny, (Knock) Penny, (Knock) Penny, (Knock) Penny, (Knock) Penny, (Knock) Penny.\nPenny: What the hell is wrong with you?\nSheldon: I\u2019m the Flash. I just knocked 30,000 times.\nPenny: Okay. What do you want, Sheldon?\nSheldon: I understand why you\u2019re upset.\nPenny: Really?\nSheldon: Yes. You\u2019re afraid that costume makes you look fat.\nPenny: No. Wait, wait, does it?\nSheldon: Don\u2019t worry. Wonder Woman was an Amazon. And Amazons tend to be very beefy gals.\nPenny: Good-bye, Sheldon.\nSheldon: But they\u2019re not blonde, so put on your wig. Hello?\nScene: The apartment. \nRaj: Stupid Aquaman.\nLeonard: If it makes you feel any better, when I was dating Penny, she used to flip out on me all the time.\nZack: Whoa. You dated Penny?\nLeonard: She didn\u2019t tell you?\nZack: She told me she dated a guy named Leonard. Who would have thought it was you?\nLeonard: Who else would it be?\nZack: I don\u2019t know. Somebody bigger and, yeah, sure. Why not you?\nSheldon: I may have failed.\nHoward: Okay, I guess we just go without a Wonder Woman.\nZack: I don\u2019t want to go without Penny.\nRaj: Oh, great. No Superman, no Wonder Woman? All we\u2019ve got is a skinny Flash, an Indian Aquaman, a nearsighted Green Lantern, and a teeny, tiny Dark Knight.\nSheldon: Obviously, we\u2019re no longer a Justice League. We have no choice but to switch to our Muppet Baby costumes.\nRaj: Ooh, I call Kermit.\nSheldon: I\u2019m Kermit. You\u2019re Scooter.\nRaj: Oh, man. Scooter sucks. He\u2019s the Aquaman of the Muppet Babies.\nHoward: No, we can still make this work. Leonard, you talk to Penny.\nLeonard: What makes you think I can convince her?\nHoward: You got her to have sex with you. Obviously, your superpower is brainwashing.\nLeonard: Okay, let me see if I understand this. You want me to convince my ex-girlfriend to go to a costume party with her new boyfriend just so we can win a stupid prize?\nSheldon: Yes. And make her wear the black wig. Good luck.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment. Knocking.\nPenny: Go away, Sheldon.\nLeonard: It\u2019s Leonard.\nPenny: Oh. Go away, Leonard.\nLeonard; Come on, let me just talk to you.\nPenny: It\u2019s open.\nLeonard: Hey.\nPenny: I\u2019m not going to that party, Leonard.\nLeonard: Okay, listen. You don\u2019t have to wear the wig. At this party, we\u2019re gonna win first prize just by showing up with a girl.\nPenny: It\u2019s not the wig.\nLeonard: Did I do something? I mean, I tried to be friends with Zack, like you said, which believe me, was difficult, given how you and me used to be, you know, you and me, and now you and him are you and him.\nPenny: Okay, look. We\u2019re not really me and him.\nLeonard: Then what are you?\nPenny: I don\u2019t know. I only started seeing Zack again so I wouldn\u2019t be alone on New Year\u2019s Eve. How pathetic is that?\nLeonard: Not as pathetic as dressing up like this and going to a comic book store on New Year\u2019s Eve.\nPenny: You make a cute Green Arrow.\nLeonard: Green Lantern.\nPenny: Like there\u2019s a difference.\nLeonard: There\u2019s a big difference. Arrow. Lantern.\nPenny: Whatever. Look, if Zack and I had just gone to a regular club or a party, it would have been fine, but this, with the costumes, and you.\nLeonard: What about me?\nPenny: Nothing. Let\u2019s go to the party. (Puts on wig) How do I look?\nLeonard: Um, I guarantee you\u2019ll be the prettiest girl there.\nHoward (outside the door): Okay, the good news is, we have a Wonder Woman.\nSheldon: Oh.\nZack: Yes.\nSheldon: What\u2019s the bad news?\nHoward: Superman probably isn\u2019t getting laid tonight.\nZack: Aw, damn.\nScene: The party. \n \nStuart: And the award for best group costume goes to Justice League of America number three!\nSheldon: Thank you! Thank you so much!\nStuart: Okay. Okay, ten seconds to midnight.\nAll: Ten, nine, eight\u2026\nSheldon: No, wait! I have a speech.\nAll: Seven, six\u2026\nSheldon: Stop counting!\nAll: Five, four, three\u2026\nSheldon: This is my moment, dag nab it!\nAll: Two, one! Happy New Year!\nSheldon: I\u2019m not going to say another word until you people settle down. I\u2019m waiting.\nScene: The street. \nZack: That was a great party. We should dress like this all the time.\nPenny: Are you high?\nLeonard: You\u2019re being a bully.\nHoward: Check it out. Those guys are breaking into that car.\nLeonard: What should we do?\nSheldon: We\u2019re the Justice League of America. There\u2019s only one thing we can do. Turn around and slowly walk away.\nZack (after a moment\u2019s thought): Nah. Hold up.\nScene: The apartment. \nLeonard: Look, I know our winter thermostat setting is 72 degrees, but I\u2019m a little warm, so I\u2019m going to turn it down.\nSheldon (as The Flash, runs to the Grand Canyon): Good Lord, how you frustrate me, Leonard Hofstadter! (Runs back) Fine.\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "8_12": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: What colour would you like to be?\nLeonard: Well, I\u2019d like to be green, but you know you always take it.\nSheldon: That\u2019s not true. Any colour\u2019s fine with me. Yeah, I could be a-a combination of blue and yellow.\nLeonard: Blue and yellow make green.\nSheldon: Well, then it\u2019s settled.\nPenny: Hi. Ready to go?\nSheldon: Oh, good news, we ordered lunch, so we can all stay here and play Lord of the Rings Risk.\nAmy: Sheldon, we said that we would play games with you tonight.\nSheldon: Oh, no, we\u2019ll still be playing it tonight, this game can easily take eight hours.\nPenny: Sweetie, you really thought I\u2019d want to do this?\nLeonard: No.\nPenny: Well, did you tell him that?\nLeonard: Yes.\nPenny: Did you say it out loud with words?\nLeonard: No.\nPenny: I don\u2019t want to spend the whole day playing a board game.\nSheldon: Yeah, well, you may change your mind when you hear that this is the new expanded edition which contains a more complete map of Middle Earth, now including the Haradwaith Territories.\nAmy: I will literally race you to the car.\nLeonard: No, no, no, come on, don\u2019t leave. Just try it.\nPenny: No. We\u2019re always doing what you guys want. Just once, it\u2019d be nice if you did something we wanted.\nSheldon: You want to be green?\nLeonard: You know, they really have tried to like a lot of the same stuff we\u2019re into.\nPenny: Yeah, we do game nights and video game nights and we watch movies with director\u2019s commentary.\nAmy: Oh, my favourite, George Lucas can talk all the way through Star Wars, I say one word and I\u2019m banished to the kitchen.\nPenny: Yeah, today Amy and I are deciding what we\u2019re all gonna do.\nLeonard: You got it, you girls are in charge.\nPenny: Thank you.\nAmy: Sheldon?\nSheldon: Fine. Now that we\u2019re not playing, you can be green.\nLeonard: Thank you.\nSheldon: And since you\u2019re green this time, I can be it next time.\nPenny: All right, let\u2019s see. What\u2019s something fun the guys would never take us to do? Oh, I know, we could go horseback riding.\nAmy: I actually can\u2019t. My hips don\u2019t open wider than 22 degrees. I rode a very thin pony once. On the first bump, just popped right off.\nPenny: All right, well, what do you want to do?\nAmy: There\u2019s a craft and folk art museum on Wilshire.\nPenny: Well, that\u2019s Wilshire\u2019s problem. Come on, you know, there, there\u2019s got to be something fun we could do that the guys will hate.\nLeonard: Hang on, why do we have to hate it?\nPenny: Three words, Doctor Who convention.\nLeonard: I did not force you to go to that.\nPenny: You walked out of the house in a fez and bow tie. I went so you didn\u2019t get beat up.\nLeonard: I wasn\u2019t gonna get beat up.\nPenny: You were, but somehow I held myself back.\nSheldon: You know what you could make us do? Ice-skating. The cold air will trigger Leonard\u2019s asthma and it plays right into my well-known fear of getting flattened by a Zamboni.\nLeonard: Now you\u2019re helping them find ways to make us miserable?\nSheldon: Well, I\u2019m sorry, Leonard, I\u2019m a problem-solver, it\u2019s what I do.\nAmy: I actually can\u2019t go ice-skating. I have unnaturally brittle ankles.\nPenny: Is there any part of your body that\u2019s normal?\nCredits sequence.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s apartment. \nRaj: Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God.\nHoward: Will you please relax?\nRaj: I can\u2019t take it, dude.\nBernadette: You okay?\nRaj: No, I\u2019m not okay. I feel like I\u2019m gonna jump out of my skin.\nBernadette: I told you not to wax down there. It\u2019s itchy when it grows back.\nRaj: I\u2019m worried about the New Horizons space probe.\nBernadette: What\u2019s he talking about?\nHoward: Nine years ago he was part of a team that launched a spacecraft to collect data about Pluto, and it\u2019s finally close enough, so this morning it turned itself on.\nRaj: We hope. The signal has to travel over three billion miles. So it\u2019s gonna be hours before we know if it even survived.\nHoward: Now we get to see him flip out because he\u2019s worried it was demolished by space ice.\nRaj: Space ice is no joke. I can\u2019t even watch Frozen anymore.\nScene: The apartment.\nAmy: Ooh, the philharmonic is playing Beethoven downtown.\nSheldon: Before you say yes, it\u2019s not the movie about the big dog.\nPenny: How come we can\u2019t think of something we both want to do?\nAmy: Because you always pick what we do and I just go along with it.\nLeonard: Ah, interesting, we\u2019re being accused of making you do things you don\u2019t like, and here you are, doing the same thing to poor Amy.\nSheldon: You should point out the hypocrisy of that.\nLeonard: That\u2019s what I was doing.\nSheldon: Oh, that wasn\u2019t clear. Try it again, but this time drive it home with how do you like them apples, Missy?\nPenny: All right, keep thinking.\nSheldon: You\u2019re making it too complicated. Why not stick to the basics? Go shopping for clothes while Leonard and I sit in those uncomfortable chairs and hold your purses, hmm? I know I\u2019d hate that. Leonard?\nLeonard: Well, yeah.\nSheldon: Well, then, it\u2019s settled?\nAmy: What do you say? Sounds kind of perfect.\nPenny: It does, somehow he managed to take all the fun out of it.\nSheldon: Well, once again, it\u2019s what I do.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s apartment.\nRaj: Oh, another two hours to go. The wait is killing me.\nHoward: I know. I get it. When I was in the Soyuz capsule returning from the space station, plummeting toward Earth at 17,000 miles per hour\u2026\nRaj: Before you finish, is this a story about patience and waiting or just another reminder that you went to space?\nHoward: A story can do two things.\nRaj: Ugh, I feel like I\u2019m gonna have a heart attack.\nHoward: You work in pharmaceuticals, don\u2019t you have anything you can give him?\nBernadette: All I have is our new urine flow drug. Won\u2019t help with his anxiety, but it\u2019s so strong, when he pees he\u2019ll fly around the room like he\u2019s got a jet pack.\nRaj: I can\u2019t stop thinking about it.\nBernadette: You know, worrying won\u2019t have any effect on what happens.\nRaj: I know.\nHoward: Maybe you need to do something more productive.\nRaj: Okay. If I make this shot in the trash can, the probe will have arrived in perfect working order.\nHoward: So, in addition to being crazy, you\u2019re resting the fate of the mission on your athletic prowess.\nRaj: Yes.\nHoward: The man who crashed his stationary bike.\nRaj: I didn\u2019t crash it, okay? My playlist was too up-tempo, I got light-headed and I fell off. Okay. It all comes down to this.\nHoward: You happy? Now you can relax.\nRaj: What kind of scientist are you? Everyone knows you got to make two out of three.\nScene: A clothes shop.\nLeonard: This isn\u2019t so bad.\nSheldon: That\u2019s easy for you to say. Your chair\u2019s not facing the lingerie section. Boy, that\u2019s a lot of panties.\nAmy: You guys comfy? This might take a while.\nSheldon: I don\u2019t understand why women insist on making a big production out of buying clothes.\nPenny: No, you\u2019re right, we should do what you do. Have our mom send us pants from the Walmart in Houston.\nSheldon: They have a man there who understands my personal style.\nPenny: Bye.\nLeonard: Uh, I\u2019ve got some bad news. There\u2019s no cell service in here.\nSheldon: Oh. Well, that\u2019s all right. There were plenty of ways to pass the time before smart phones were invented.\nLeonard: That\u2019s true.\nSheldon: I\u2019ll look them up. Son of a biscuit.\nLeonard: Sheldon, it\u2019s fine.\nSheldon: No, it\u2019s not fine. What kind of store in the 21st century doesn\u2019t at least have Wi-Fi? I\u2019m going to call their corporate office. Son of a biscuit.\nScene: The same, later.\nSheldon: Let\u2019s see, my armies are going to attack the Shire from Buckland. And I roll a five and a three.\nLeonard: Okay. And to defend, I roll two sixes. I win.\nSheldon: Boy, double-sixes again. You know, if I hadn\u2019t seen it with my own eyes, I wouldn\u2019t believe it. I wonder how long we\u2019re gonna be stuck here.\nLeonard: I don\u2019t know, but the girls do a lot for us. It\u2019s the least we can do.\nSheldon: Oh, that\u2019s true. I suppose it\u2019s only fair we make compromises.\nLeonard: Look at you, being all mature.\nSheldon: I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re so surprised. If there\u2019s one thing I know about after living with you for so many years, it\u2019s how to compromise.\nLeonard: I, I\u2019m sorry? You make compromises for me?\nSheldon: All the time.\nLeonard: On Earth? In our lives? That, that, that we\u2019re living?\nSheldon: Oh, yes. I, just yesterday, you had a, a big piece of lettuce stuck in your teeth at lunch. Did I say anything? No. I compromised and kept my mouth shut. Like you should\u2019ve, because everyone was laughing at you.\nLeonard: That is not a compromise. A compromise is me driving you everywhere because you refuse to learn how.\nSheldon: Oh, I learned how. Amy taught me.\nLeonard: What? Then. then why don\u2019t you do it?\nSheldon: Uh, well, it\u2019s scary. And sometimes I get the pedals mixed up. But, more importantly, driving me to work is one of the things that gives your life purpose. I can\u2019t take that away from you, so what do I do? Oh, come on, I\u2019m practically feeding you the answer. I compromise.\nScene: Raj\u2019s car.\nRaj: Hey, uh, thanks for keeping me company.\nHoward: I\u2019m happy to. I think getting out of the apartment will do you good. So, where we headed?\nRaj: If it\u2019s okay with you, I\u2019d like to go to temple.\nHoward: Buddy, trust me, you don\u2019t want to convert to Judaism. I mean, I know I make it look cool, but it\u2019s not all briskets and dreidels.\nRaj: I meant a Hindu temple.\nHoward: Oh. Okay. It\u2019s not like Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, right? Some bald guy with horns isn\u2019t gonna rip my heart out.\nRaj: Dude, that movie\u2019s an imperialist fantasy that makes the followers of a beautiful and peaceful religion look like a bunch of bloodthirsty barbarians.\nHoward: You love that movie.\nRaj: Yeah, it\u2019s pretty great.\nHoward: I\u2019m surprised to see you suddenly get religious.\nRaj: Why?\nHoward: Well, because I\u2019ve known you for ten years and you\u2019ve never gone to temple, you never talked about believing in God, and last Diwali I watched you eat two pounds of sacred cow at a Brazilian steak house.\nRaj: Religion is a very personal thing. I do go to temple, I just, I don\u2019t talk about it.\nHoward: Yeah, but you\u2019re a scientist.\nRaj: So?\nHoward: So, as a scientist, you believe the way to understand the universe is through facts and evidence, and now you\u2019re counting on some blue chick with a hundred arms to help you?\nRaj: That is so offensive. Does everything you know about Hinduism come from Indiana Jones?\nHoward: No. There\u2019s also Apu from The Simpsons.\nRaj: Well, lots of scientists believe in God. Okay? Newton, uh, Faraday, uh, Pascal, all were believers. Even Einstein was famous for attacking quantum theory on the grounds that God does not play dice with the universe.\nHoward: Well, of course he believed in God. he slept with Marilyn Monroe.\nRaj: Actually there\u2019s no proof of that.\nHoward: You believe in your religion, I\u2019ll believe in mine.\nScene: The store changing rooms.\nAmy: How\u2019s it going in there?\nPenny: Uh, not really a great outfit for work, unless something opens up in the hookers and whores division. Hey, can I ask you something?\nAmy: Sure.\nPenny: Do I really force you to do things you don\u2019t want to?\nAmy: Yeah, but it\u2019s okay.\nPenny: How is it okay?\nAmy: I promised myself, if I ever got friends, I\u2019d do whatever they said. Really, I\u2019m lucky you found me before a cult did.\nPenny: Well, you know, that was a long time ago. You\u2019re a different woman now. You\u2019re smart, you\u2019ve got great friends, you\u2019ve got a boyfriend, you\u2019re pretty, you have zero fashion sense, but, anyway, tonight we\u2019re gonna do whatever you want.\nAmy: Really?\nPenny: Absolutely. You name it, we\u2019re doing it.\nAmy: Basket weaving at the craft museum.\nPenny: Well, you named it.\nScene: The store.\nSheldon: Oh, here\u2019s another one. I wish that the apple pancake mix was on the top shelf because it starts with an A, but I don\u2019t put it there because I don\u2019t want you breaking one of your little legs when you\u2019re supposed to be making my breakfast.\nLeonard: Is it my turn to talk about the compromises I make?\nSheldon: I wasn\u2019t done, but go ahead. He said, compromising.\nLeonard: Because of you, I\u2019m not allowed to adjust the temperature in my own home. I\u2019m not allowed to whistle. I don\u2019t wear shoes that might squeak.\nSheldon: Well, you\u2019re a physicist, not a circus clown.\nLeonard: Sheldon, do you realize I don\u2019t live with the woman I love because of you? No other reason. Just you.\nSheldon: Is that true?\nLeonard: Yes, it\u2019s true. The last time I brought it up, you had an emotional breakdown and got on a train and ran away.\nSheldon: Well, given my history on the subject, t seems a little reckless to bring it up now.\nLeonard: You have no idea how much you inconvenience the lives of everyone around you. It\u2019s exhausting.\nSheldon: You know what? You think you\u2019re so tolerant, but the truth is you\u2019re mean to me a lot. Yeah, you think that I don\u2019t notice all those sarcastic comments and those eye rolls, but I do. Hmm? I have excellent peripheral vision. On a good day, I can see my ears.\nLeonard: Sheldon, I, I\u2019m sorry if I hurt your feelings. I\u2019ve been holding a lot of this in for a while.\nSheldon: Well, I\u2019m sorry, too. And if you want to live with Penny, then I think you should.\nLeonard: Do you mean that?\nSheldon: Yes. Yeah, just put on your squeaky shoes and eee-eee-eee your way out of my life.\nLeonard: Come on, don\u2019t get upset.\nSheldon: I\u2019m not upset. I\u2019m just imagining a world without my best friend in it.\nLeonard: Sheldon.\nSheldon: It\u2019s okay.\nLeonard: I\u2019m not leaving your world. I\u2019m just talking about living across the hall.\nSheldon: I understand. Either way, I want you to know that I\u2019m aware of how difficult I can be. So I just want to say thank you for putting up with me.\nLeonard: Buddy.\nPenny: How are you guys getting along? What? Why are there tears?\nLeonard: Everything\u2019s fine. We just started talking about living arrangements.\nAmy: Are you crazy? You know he\u2019s a flight risk.\nSheldon: That\u2019s exactly what I told him.\nPenny: Sheldon, we know this is a sensitive subject, and Leonard\u2019s not gonna move out until you\u2019re ready.\nSheldon: Well, what if you did it gradually?\nLeonard: All right. How about we start with two nights a week I live with Penny?\nSheldon: How about one night and I let you whistle?\nLeonard: Okay.\nSheldon: When I\u2019m not home.\nLeonard: You got it.\nSheldon: There we go, compromising again. We really are the best.\nScene: The temple car park.\nHoward: Here we go, my first Hindu temple.\nRaj: You see behind the fountain, that tower that looks like a pyramid? It\u2019s called a Sikhara. It symbolizes the, the connection between the human and the divine.\nHoward: Huh. I always thought it was mini golf.\nRaj: All right. Shall we?\nHoward: Yeah. Just, uh, is there anything I should know before I go in?\nRaj: Like what?\nHoward: Like am I dressed okay?\nRaj: Really? So every other place you\u2019ve been, you thought this was fine?\nHoward: I know you\u2019re under a lot of pressure, so I\u2019m gonna let that pass.\nRaj: Sorry. You\u2019re right. I\u2019m so stressed. But you know what, whenever I walk into that temple I realize that whatever happens, it\u2019s okay. We\u2019re all part of an immense pattern, and though we can\u2019t understand it, we can be happy to know that it\u2019s, it\u2019s working its will through us.\nHoward: That\u2019s nice.\nRaj: Whether you call it God or the universe or the self, we\u2019re all interconnected, and that\u2019s just a beautiful\u2026 Son of a bitch, that guy just dinged my car. S, seriously? You were just gonna drive away? Like my life isn\u2019t hard enough right now. A space probe might be destroyed, my parents are going through an awful divorce, the guy who cuts my dog\u2019s hair just gave her bangs.\nHoward: Raj.\nRaj: You saw her. She looks like Jim Carrey from Dumb and Dumber.\nHoward: Raj, you just got a text. The probe turned on. It\u2019s fine.\nRaj: Oh, good. Namaste, Grandpa.\nScene: The craft museum. \nLeonard: I thought this was gonna be boring, but it\u2019s actually kind of fun.\nPenny: Don\u2019t tell Amy that. We\u2019ll be here every Sunday.\nAmy: Sheldon, that really is an excellent basket.\nSheldon: It\u2019s not a basket. It\u2019s a soldier\u2019s helmet from 16th century China.\nAmy: Very nice.\nLeonard: Yeah, it looks great.\nSheldon: I saw that.\nScene: Penny\u2019s bedroom.\nLeonard: Well, roomie, it\u2019s only one night a week, but it\u2019s a start.\nPenny: I know. I\u2019m really proud of Sheldon.\nLeonard: Yeah, I\u2019m proud of him, too.\nSheldon (in Penny\u2019s living room): Can you keep it down?

Raj?\nRaj: Spending Valentine\u2019s Day with Emily.\nLeonard: You don\u2019t sound very excited about it.\nRaj: Oh, I am, I am. I, I guess I\u2019m still wondering if Emily and I are right for each other.\nHoward: Does this have to do with that girl you had coffee with?\nRaj: You mean the strong, sexy angel I can\u2019t stop thinking about? Who can say?\nHoward: You\u2019ve been talking about breaking up with Emily forever. Why don\u2019t you just do it already?\nLeonard: Yeah, just get it over with.\nRaj: Well, you say it like it\u2019s easy.

I just got in and went somewhere.\nCredits sequence. \nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment.\nPenny: So, you really gonna break up with her?\nRaj: Yeah, I think so. Do you have any advice?\nPenny: Well, I have broken up with my fair share of guys. I mean, how many times did I break up with Leonard?\nLeonard: I stopped counting at four.\nPenny: All right, my advice to you is do it at her place so you can leave when you need to, uh, tell the truth, make it quick and be prepared for tears.\nRaj: Oh, I\u2019m gonna do a pre-cry before I go in there. Really dry myself out.\nLeonard: She meant Emily.\nPenny: No, I, I really didn\u2019t.\nScene: Emily\u2019s apartment.\nEmily: You\u2019re seriously breaking up with me?\nRaj: Yeah.\nEmily: And you thought right before Valentine\u2019s Day was a good time to do it?\nRaj: You\u2019re right, let\u2019s talk again in a few days.\nScene: Raj\u2019s apartment.\nRaj (on phone): Hey, Claire.

But I said it like a badass.\nPenny: All right, well, can\u2019t you, like, slip him some money or something?\nLeonard: Really? I\u2019ve never done that before. Does it work?\nPenny: Do people like money? Is that what you\u2019re asking?\nLeonard: A lot of attitude from the woman who thought MC squared was a rapper.\nPenny: Now, is that a smart thing to say on a holiday that\u2019s basically national sex night?\nLeonard: I\u2019m sorry. You\u2019re pretty, I\u2019m stupid. Hello. Uh, just checking again for Hofstadter. Still gonna be an hour?\nMaitre d\u2019: I\u2019m afraid so.\nLeonard: Okay. Thanks. Hey.

That was clear, right? \u2018Cause you\u2019re not getting anything else.\nAmy: Since we\u2019re live, you\u2019ll finally be able to reach out to us with your flag thoughts and flag questions.\nSheldon: Allow us to answer a few quick ones that we get all the time. Uh, uh, yes, I really am a doctor. Uh, yes, she really is my girlfriend.\nAmy: No, I just blink a lot, it\u2019s not Morse code for rescue me. Oh, uh, ok, uh, here\u2019s our first call. Hello, and welcome to Fun With Flags. What\u2019s your question?\nRaj (voice): What is wrong with me? Why am I so self-destructive?\nAmy: Rajesh?\nRaj: Yes. Whenever things are going well, I always find a way to ruin it. You two look happy, how do you do it?\nAmy: I, I think it starts with good communication.\nSheldon: You know what, that\u2019s not a flag question. Next caller.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s house.\nHoward: I hope you don\u2019t think I\u2019m just saying this because it\u2019s Valentine\u2019s Day, but, I love you so much.\nBernadette: I\u2019m gonna put this down your robe. It\u2019s not moving, but I think it\u2019s still alive.\nHoward: Well, should we put it back in there a few minutes?\nBernadette: No. No, and it\u2019s not a rat, it\u2019s a rabbit. We need to save it.\nHoward: Well, how do we do that?\nBernadette: Um, I don\u2019t know, look it up on your phone. I\u2019m gonna wrap it in a towel.\nHoward: Um, taking care of injured rabbit. Okay. Make sure it\u2019s comfortable and warm. Well, it was just in a hot tub. I\u2019m gonna say check.\nBernadette: Anything else?\nHoward: To make sure it\u2019s not dehydrated, feed him an electrolyte solution. If it\u2019s not responding, use a warm cloth to wash its face and genitals. Yeah.\nScene: The restaurant.\nPenny: This is ridiculous. You know, I\u2019m gonna go talk to the ma\u00eetre d\u2019.\nLeonard: What are you gonna say?\nPenny: I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m, I\u2019m gonna flirt with him.\nLeonard: I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m comfortable with that.\nPenny: I\u2019m still sleeping with you tonight.\nLeonard: See if you can get a table by the window.\nPenny: Hi there. What\u2019s your name?\nMaitre d\u2019: Glen.\nPenny: Oh, boy, it is crazy in here tonight, huh, Glen?\nMaitre d\u2019: Well, you know, Valentine\u2019s Day.\nPenny: Yes. Oh, bet your girlfriend is super bummed you had to work tonight. Anyway, look, we have been waiting a while, and I just\u2026\nMaitre d\u2019: With all due respect, ma\u2019am, there\u2019s nothing I can do.\nPenny: You don\u2019t have to call me ma\u2019am.\nMaitre d\u2019: Okay.\nPenny: I mean, we\u2019re basically the same age.\nMaitre d\u2019: Okay.\nPenny: How old are you?\nMaitre d\u2019: I\u2019m 21. How old are you?\nPenny: Just shut up, Glen. Come on, let\u2019s get out of here.\nLeonard: What? Why?\nPenny: Because I\u2019m young. Let\u2019s go.\nScene: The apartment.\nAmy: Rajesh, it\u2019s perfectly normal to have doubts after breaking up with someone.\nRaj (voice): You really think so?\nSheldon: Yeah, you know what\u2019s not normal? Blubbering about emotions during a flag show. Unless that emotion is excitement over New Zealand changing their flag. Yeah, good luck, you crazy Kiwis, we\u2019re rooting for you.\nAmy: Your friend is hurting.\nRaj: No, Sheldon\u2019s right. Emily did say I always talk about my feelings too much.\nSheldon: I suppose that could be a legitimate concern in a relationship. Uh, perhaps even a, a red flag. And speaking of red flags, check out this sexy number from the former Soviet Union. Hubba, hubba.\nAmy: Oh. Uh, we-we have another caller. Hi. You\u2019re on Fun with Flags.\nBarry (voice): Hewwo. I want to talk about how wonewy I am, too.\nRaj: Kripke? Is that you?\nBarry: Yeah, I\u2019m just sitting here all by myself wondering if I\u2019w ever find someone to share my wife with. Pwefewabwy Asian, 18-24, no fatties.\nSheldon: Please, all comments and questions should be flag-related.\nBarry: Aw wight. Is my pole fwag-wewated?\nSheldon: I don\u2019t see why not.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s house.\nBernadette: He\u2019s eating. That\u2019s a good sign.\nHoward: You\u2019re gonna have to wait one hour until you can go swimming again.\nBernadette: He\u2019s pretty cute.\nHoward: He is. Should we name him?\nBernadette: It is Valentine\u2019s Day. How about Valentino?\nHoward: Nice. A classic rabbit name. Peter Rabbit, Roger Rabbit. Valentino Wolowitz Rabbit. Oh, look at all that chest hair and overbite. Of course you\u2019re a Wolowitz. Son of a bitch, he bit me.\nBernadette: Are you okay?\nHoward: No, I\u2019m not okay. Wild rabbits can have rabies.\nBernadette: Oh. Well, why did you put your finger near its mouth?\nHoward: Poor judgement, obviously.\nBernadette: He\u2019s so little. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s fine.\nHoward: How can it be fine? I just got attacked by a clearly anti-Semitic wild animal.\nScene: Leonard\u2019s car.\nLeonard: It\u2019s not what we planned, but this isn\u2019t so bad, right?\nPenny: It is freaking amazing.\nLeonard: Well, glad you\u2019re feeling better.\nPenny: I was just hungry and cranky, and I\u2019ve never been called ma\u2019am before.\nLeonard: Is that a big deal?\nPenny: Kind of. When was the first time someone called you sir?\nLeonard: Sixth grade, but I wore a sport coat and carried a briefcase, so\u2026\nPenny: Can you believe when I met you I was 22? I mean, it\u2019s crazy. Where did all that time go?\nLeonard: Mm, you watched The Bachelor a lot.\nPenny: Yeah, go ahead and make jokes, but your thirties are almost over.\nLeonard: No, they\u2019re not.\nPenny: You\u2019re closer to 40 than you are 30.\nLeonard: Ha, ha. You married an old man. Tell you what. Let\u2019s do something fun tonight.\nPenny: Won\u2019t make us any younger.\nLeonard: Well, maybe not, but some day we actually will be old, and we\u2019ll look back on this night and remember what a good time we had.\nPenny: Okay, like what?\nLeonard: I know. Food fight. I\u2019ll keep thinking.\nScene: The apartment.\nAmy: Look, I know you both feel bad about being alone, but sometimes the best thing you can do is take a little time for yourself, especially when you just got out of a relationship.\nSheldon: Speaking of ending relationships, when British Honduras became Belize, they designed a new flag with a tree on it, and I would like to hang myself from that tree.\nRaj: But, Amy, when you and Sheldon split up, didn\u2019t you start dating someone right away?\nAmy: Well, I, I wouldn\u2019t say right away.\nSheldon: And actually, it was three different men.\nBarry: Thwee diffewent men? Damn, girl, way to give the milk away?\nAmy: Oh, looks like we just lost Kripke.\nBarry: No, actuawwy, I\u2019m stiw here.\nAmy: Now?\nBarry: Yup.\nAmy: Now?\nBarry: Yup.\nAmy: Now? Oh, looks like we just lost Kripke.\nRaj: Before Emily, I was alone for so long. I just, I don\u2019t know if I can do that again.\nSheldon: Well, you know, here is something that might cheer you up. The flag of the Isle of Man is nothing but three legs sharing a weird pair of underpants, so you think you got problems.\nAmy: I have an idea. Maybe someone in our audience would be interested in meeting Rajesh. Ladies, I can attest that he is a kind, handsome, intelligent\u2026\nRaj: Rich parents, don\u2019t forget, rich parents.\nAmy: \u2026spoiled astrophysicist who not only\u2026 oh. Well, that was quick. Hi. You\u2019re on Fun with Flags.\nBarry: Hey, I think I got cut off.\nAmy: Hello, Kripke.\nBarry: I have a fwag question. How many men did you have sex with?\nScene: Leonard\u2019s car.\nLeonard: Let\u2019s see. What\u2019s young and fun? Uh, we could go dancing.\nLeonard: Are you actually gonna dance?\nLeonard: Of course.\nPenny: Yeah. No one wants to see that. Hey, how about skinny dipping at the beach?\nLeonard: No, I don\u2019t need any fish nibbling my business.\nPenny: Oh, there\u2019s a screening of Moulin Rouge, I heard the crowd sings along and stuff.\nLeonard: That sounds fun. When\u2019s it start?\nPenny: Midnight.\nLeonard: Midnight. Really? You know what? Let\u2019s do it.\nPenny: Okay, great. Oh, wait. Uh, it\u2019s sold out.\nLeonard: Oh, thank God.\nPenny: Yes.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s house.\nHoward: It says, rabies in rabbits is highly unlikely.\nBernadette: Oh, terrific.\nHoward: It\u2019s not terrific. Lots of highly unlikely things happen. You saw what\u2019s under this robe, and you still married me.\nBernadette: If you\u2019re really worried, we\u2019ll take him to the vet and have him tested.\nHoward: Good. Thank you. Oh, okay, there is a test. All they have to do is cut off his head and check his brain.\nBernadette: Oh, cut off his head? That\u2019s where his little nose is.\nHoward: He\u2019s not showing any symptoms. I guess I\u2019ll just go to the emergency room to be safe.\nBernadette: Howie, this is just your hypochondria.\nHoward: No, when I sat on the mute button and thought I\u2019d gone deaf, that was my hypochondria.\nBernadette: We\u2019ll find another time to tell him I\u2019m pregnant.\nScene: The apartment.\nRaj (voice): I mean, this is the first time I\u2019ve ever broken up with someone. I just, I didn\u2019t realize it was gonna hurt this much.\nAmy: It really can.\nSheldon: All right. Nothing about this is fun. No one wants to talk about flags, and I haven\u2019t spoken in over ten minutes, so, enjoy your new show, Internet. Dr. Amy Farrah Flower present with.\nRaj: I\u2019m sorry for bothering you. I\u2019ll hang up now.\nAmy: No, hold on, Rajesh. You know, you\u2019re not being very sympathetic. You know first hand that breakups are hard.\nSheldon: Fine. If you insist on making me a part of this, yes, I knowledge how painful they can be. However, pain has an evolutionary purpose. It provides information from the environment that, uh, behaviour isn\u2019t good for us.\nBarry: Wike when I feww in wove with that stwipper and bought her a Pwius.\nAmy: I\u2019m just gonna push all the buttons.\nSheldon: Raj, now, I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re suffering. When Amy and I were broken up, I also suffered. And this may sound surprising, but I\u2019m grateful for having gone through it.\nAmy: Really?\nSheldon: Yes. I believe our relationship now is stronger than ever.\nAmy: So do I.\nSheldon: When, when we were apart, I learned how important you are to me. And I realize that when two people are in love, sometimes they\u2026\nLeonard and Penny: Happy Valentine\u2019s Day!\nLeonard: We are young and fun.\nSheldon: I stand corrected. Fun.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Congratulations on a successful live show.\nAmy: And a lovely Valentine\u2019s Day.\nPenny: Cleaning up is not young and fun.\nLeonard: It can be. Confetti fight. Maybe you should take a break. I got this.\nSheldon: Did you know the singular of confetti is confetto?\nAmy: Interesting, and when would you use the singular?\nSheldon: I\u2019m glad you asked. Amy, you have a confetto in your nose. No, no, no, no. Other side. There you go.\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "6_4": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The Apartment.\nRaj: Howard\u2019s capsule should be re-entering the atmosphere any minute.\nLeonard: It\u2019ll be good to have him back.\nRaj: The Fantastic Four reunited.\nSheldon: Yeah, you had a good run, Fake Wolowitz. We\u2019ll remember you with nostalgic fondness, the way we do the dial-up modem, the VHS tape, or, or Leonard\u2019s gym membership.\nRaj: We\u2019re not kicking him out. Stuart and I have become good friends.\nSheldon: Okay, one vote for, one vote against. Leonard, you\u2019re the tiebreaker.\nLeonard: I don\u2019t have a problem with Stuart. Besides, he gives us a twenty percent discount at his comic book store.\nSheldon: Well, I don\u2019t sell my friendship that cheaply.\nStuart: I can go thirty.\nSheldon: Welcome aboard, old chum.\nRaj: Okay, the NASA Web site says Howard\u2019s final descent has begun.\nSheldon: He left a boy, he returns a boy-sized hero.\nScene: The Soyuz Capsule. Howard is screaming.\nDimitri: Loops, calm down!\nHoward (singing): Baruch atah, Adonai, Eloheinu. Melech haolam, hamotzi. Lechem min haaretz\nMike: What\u2019s that?\nHoward: The Jewish prayer for eating bread! We don\u2019t have one for falling out of space! We did it! We\u2019re on the ground! We survived!\nMike: That was just the parachute. We still have another six miles to go. (Howard screams again)\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The Airport Arrivals Hall.\nBernadette: Waiting for my husband.\nMan in Suit: That\u2019s nice.\nBernadette: He\u2019s coming back from outer space.\nMan in Suit: I think this flight\u2019s coming from Houston.\nBernadette: No, I mean, he\u2026 Never mind. There he is! Howie!\nVarious others (all at once): Howie! Howie!\nHoward: Whoa, thank you. Great to be back on Earth.\nHowie Mandel: Uh, I think they\u2019re here for me, Ringo.\nMan in Suit: Mr. Mandel, I\u2019m your driver.\nHowie Mandel: Oh, thanks. That nut job was telling everybody on the plane he\u2019s an astronaut.\nBernadette: I missed you so much.\nHoward: I missed you, too. Where are the guys?\nBernadette: Oh, it\u2019s just me.\nHoward: Oh, I get it. They\u2019re waiting back home with a big surprise party. Don\u2019t worry, I can act surprised. (Does)\nBernadette: No, I told them they could have you tomorrow night. Tonight, you belong to me. (Sneezes) \nHoward: Gesundheit. You okay?\nBernadette: I am now that you\u2019re back. Come on, let\u2019s go home so I can tear off those little pants.\nHoward: Great. Just keep in mind astronauts lose a lot of muscle tone in space, so you might have to do most of the heavy lifting.\nScene: The apartment. \nSheldon: You know, I am very disappointed that I won\u2019t be able to celebrate Howard\u2019s accomplishment tonight.\nAmy: Me, too. But we\u2019ll see him tomorrow.\nSheldon: Yes, it\u2019s just that in all the years I\u2019ve known him, he\u2019s never had the opportunity to receive my admiration. I was excited to see the look on his face when it finally happened.\nPenny: You\u2019re unbelievable.\nSheldon: I know.\nLeonard: All right, Pictionary. What are the teams?\nPenny: How about boys versus girls?\nSheldon: Oh, that hardly seems fair. But I guess any team that I\u2019m not on has a decided disadvantage.\nPenny: Once again, unbelievable.\nSheldon: Yeah, once again, I know.\nPenny: All right, round one. Here.\nSheldon: Got it.\nPenny: Okay. Ready, set, go.\nAmy: Uh, box? Uh, window?\nLeonard: Batman. Batman and Robin. Uh, Wonder Twins plus the monkey. Wonder Twins plus the monkey and Batman.\nAmy: Uh, gift? Uh, Present!\nPenny: Present! Yeah!\nSheldon: Oh, Leonard. Now, how can you not get that?\nLeonard: In what universe is that a present?\nSheldon: It\u2019s not a present, it\u2019s the present. Look. There\u2019s you and me. There\u2019s Penny and Amy. We\u2019re playing Pictionary. In the present.\nPenny: Oh, my God, we\u2019re gonna kill them.\nLater\nSheldon: It\u2019s a quark-gluon plasma.\nLeonard: No.\nSheldon: It\u2019s asymptotically free partons inside a quark-gluon plasma.\nLeonard: Nothing with quarks.\nSheldon: It\u2019s an observational rebuttal of the Lambda-CDM model of the universe.\nLeonard: No.\nPenny: It\u2019s a chocolate chip cookie.\nAmy: Yes.\nLeonard: How could you miss that?\nSheldon: Hey, if you want someone to guess chocolate chip cookie, you draw a glass of milk next to it.\nLeonard: Penny got it.\nSheldon: Yeah, only after I eliminated all the obvious answers. You\u2019re welcome.\nLater\nLeonard: Oh, uh, uh, uh, sausage. Uh, uh, uh, uh, bratwurst? Oh, oh, a hot dog.\nAmy: Penny, aren\u2019t you gonna draw something?\nPenny: Relax, we got time, this is so fun.\nSheldon: There.\nLeonard: A solar system. Uh, uh, uh, uh, um, unidentified flying liverwurst? I don\u2019t\u2026\nAmy: Now?\nPenny: Soon.\nSheldon: Come on, Leonard, I am spoon-feeding this to you.\nLeonard: I don\u2019t know, uh, Casper the alcoholic ghost?\nPenny: All right, that\u2019s enough. (Draws)\nAmy: Uh, hand. Uh, nail, polish?\nPenny: Yep!\nSheldon: Wait, no, no. No. The word is Polish. See, look. Polish sausage. And the, the model of the solar system developed by Nicolaus Copernicus, a Polish astronomer. And then, finally, if that wasn\u2019t enough, which it should have been, this is Madame Curie killing herself by discovering radium, who, although she was a naturalized French citizen, was Polish by birth.\nPenny: Excuse me, the word is polish. See? Small P.\nSheldon: Ah. So it is. I guess we both share blame on this one.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s Bedroom.\nHoward: Bernie, you okay?\nBernadette (off): Yeah, I\u2019ll be right there. (Hacking and coughing noises)\nHoward: Did you get a sea lion while I was gone?\nBernadette: It\u2019s just allergies.\nHoward: Okay.\nBernadette: Took some Benadryl. I\u2019ll be fine. So, did you miss me?\nHoward: Oh. Are you kidding? Every minute of every\u2026\nBernadette (has a coughing fit): Ew. Excuse me.\nHoward: Sweetie, we don\u2019t have to do this now.\nBernadette: Yes, we do. You left right after we got married. This is like our honeymoon. Now, hold on to your hat. Oh. Uh-oh.\nHoward: You okay?\nBernadette: A little dizzy. Must be the Benadryl. Switch places with me.\nHoward: Okay.\nBernadette: Now, kiss me. (He does. She starts snoring)\nHoward: Bernadette? Bernie? Bernie?\nBernadette (waking suddenly): That was amazing. You made me feel things I never\u2026 (starts snoring again)\nHoward: Well, that was quick, and a little gross. Now, I know how she feels.\nScene: The apartment. \nPenny: Hey, Sheldon, you\u2019re always full of fun little facts. Where did the expression got your ass handed to you come from?\nSheldon: Don\u2019t know.\nPenny: I wonder if it\u2019s from, like, ancient Rome where they\u2019d actually chop somebody\u2019s ass off and then go, here. You know, to appease Loseroneous, the god of losers.\nSheldon: I am not a loser. Pictionary is not a true test of any real intelligence or skill.\nLeonard: Mmm, in all fairness, Pictionary has verbal skills, visual skills. It\u2019s a pretty well-rounded game.\nSheldon: Lot of big talk from a man who can\u2019t draw a chocolate chip cookie.\nPenny: All right, fine, pick another game. Amy and I will beat you at anything.\nSheldon: All right. Let\u2019s play Physics Fiesta.\nPenny: Oh, come on, what is that?\nSheldon: It\u2019s a game that I just invented, in which the participants answer physics questions in remedial Spanish. Um, \u00bfD\u00f3nde est\u00e1 el boson de Higgs?\nLeonard: En el acelerador de particulares.\nSheldon: Bueno, mi amigo.\nPenny: No, no, we\u2019re not playing some dumb made-up game.\nSheldon: All games are made up. They\u2019re not found in nature. You don\u2019t just dig in the ground, come across a rich vein of Rock\u2019em Sock\u2019em Robots.\nLeonard: Just pick another game.\nAmy: Why don\u2019t we do something athletic like go over to the university pool and play water polo?\nLeonard: No good, Sheldon doesn\u2019t float.\nSheldon: That is true. I have a higher than normal body density. If I run too deep a bath, I drown.\nAmy: All right, let\u2019s keep it simple. How about darts?\nSheldon: No, that\u2019s not fair either.\nPenny: Why not?\nSheldon: Darts is a bar game. You\u2019ve been frequenting drinking establishments since you were of legal age.\nLeonard: Yeah, that\u2019s when it started.\nSheldon: Well, regardless, she has a distinct advantage in all tavern-based competitions. Pool, beer pong, wet T-shirt contests, they\u2019re all out.\nPenny: Okay. Just for the record, I have never entered a wet T-shirt contest. I\u2019ve won a few, but that\u2019s just because I spill when I\u2019m drunk, so\u2026\nAmy: We could go to the cadaver lab at UCLA and play real-life Operation.\nSheldon: No.\nLeonard: Uh-uh.\nPenny: I don\u2019t think so.\nAmy: Are you sure? I mean, the nose doesn\u2019t light up, but if the corpse is fresh enough, sometimes you can get the leg to jerk.\nScene: Mrs Wolowitz\u2019s House.\nHoward: Hey, Ma, twinkle, twinkle, your little star is home. Ma, the chain\u2019s on the door.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Howard? I thought I wasn\u2019t going to see you till tomorrow.\nHoward: Yeah, well, Bernie\u2019s not feeling well, so I thought I\u2019d stop by, tell you about the greatest adventure of my life, see if you can make me feel bad about it.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Uh, uh, okay, hold on, I\u2019m not decent.\nHoward: All right. Woman hasn\u2019t tied her robe in 20 years. Suddenly she\u2019s not decent?\nMan\u2019s Voice (off): You want me to hide in the closet or go out the back?\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Shh, you need to whisper.\nHoward: Ma, who is in there?\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Uh, nobody. The TV is on.\nMan\u2019s Voice (off): I only got one sock. Where\u2019s my other sock?\nHoward: Who is that?\nMrs Wolowitz (off): I told you, it\u2019s the TV. Jay Leno lost a sock, it\u2019s hilarious.\nHoward: If you\u2019re busy, I can come back.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Just give me a second. Go, go, go, go.\nHoward (to man climbing out window): Dr. Schneider?\nDr Schneider: Oh, hello, Howard.\nHoward: What are you doing here?\nDr Schneider: Um, house call.\nHoward: You\u2019re a dentist.\nDr Schneider: Yes, yes, I am. I think he\u2019s on to us.\nScene: The apartment.\nPenny: Okay, glasses off. Find Waldo.\nSheldon: Hurry up, find him, find him.\nLeonard: I\u2019m trying. Don\u2019t yell at me.\nSheldon: For goodness\u2019 sake, he\u2019s wearing a hat, glasses, and a red striped shirt.\nLeonard: I know what he looks like.\nAmy: Oh, there he is, I got him.\nPenny: Yes, we win again.\nSheldon: How could you not find him?\nLeonard: Because he\u2019s hard to find. If he was easy to find, the books would be called There\u2019s Waldo.\nLater. Penny and Sheldon have their foreheads on light sabres and are spinning.\nLeonard: 57, 58, 59, that\u2019s one minute.\nAmy: Long division, long division. Go, go, go.\nLeonard: Remember, show your work.\nSheldon: I\u2019m okay. I\u2019m okay. I\u2019m not okay.\nLeonard: Get up, we can\u2019t lose at math.\nPenny: 37.\nAmy: Yes.\nLater \nAmy: Ready, set, wrestle. (Penny pins Sheldon straight away) One, two, three, pin.\nPenny: Mwah!\nSheldon: Stop that.\nPenny: Mwah!\nSheldon: Amy, do something. Amy, help. Amy, stop that. Amy, Penny, both of you, stop it.\nScene: Raj\u2019s apartment.\nHoward: One to beam aboard?\nRaj: Oh, my God, you\u2019re back. Oh, look at you. You, you look like you grew.\nHoward: Yeah. The lack of gravity did decompress my spine, so I\u2019m like an inch and a half taller. I\u2019m going to the DMV tomorrow to get my license changed before I shrink back.\nRaj: Oh, uh, come in, come in. Oh, I, uh, I didn\u2019t think I was going to get to see you until tomorrow.\nHoward: Yeah, well, Bernadette\u2019s a little under the weather and my mom\u2019s kind of under my dentist.\nRaj: Wait, your, your mother is sleeping with your dentist?\nHoward: Former dentist. I need a new one now that I know where his hands have been.\nRaj: So you\u2019re wandering all around by yourself? That\u2019s not the kind of hero\u2019s welcome an astronaut should come home to.\nHoward: It\u2019s okay, you know, we space cowboys don\u2019t do what we do for glory and fame. We leave that to your rock stars and your athletes and your Howie Mandels.\nStuart: Oh, hey, man, welcome back.\nHoward: Oh, Stuart, thanks. What are you doing here?\nStuart: I, I kind of live here now.\nRaj: Just until he gets back on his feet, which are looking pretty good in the boots I bought him for his birthday.\nStuart: Ah, he\u2019s spoiling me and I love it.\nHoward: Wow, so you guys are like buds now?\nRaj: Oh, yeah, we hang out all the time.\nStuart: Plus, he doesn\u2019t have a girlfriend, I don\u2019t have a girlfriend.\nRaj: It\u2019s like we both had these holes in our lives, but now we fill each other\u2019s holes.\nStuart: Uh, that sounds a little funny to an American ear.\nRaj: Which part?\nStuart: Just all of it.\nHoward: Okay, so what do you guys got going on tonight?\nStuart: Raj is taking me to the Sound of Music sing-along.\nHoward: Sound of Music sing-along? That used to be our thing, but that\u2019s cool.\nRaj: Oh, Howard, it\u2019s still our thing. Come with us, we\u2019ll, we\u2019ll get you a scalped ticket.\nHoward: So I\u2019d be sitting by myself?\nRaj: We\u2019ll switch. You\u2019ll come sit with me after intermission.\nStuart: So I, I, I\u2019d be sitting by myself during Edelweiss?\nHoward: No, no, you guys go. Have fun.\nRaj: Okay, uh, will I get to see you tomorrow?\nHoward: Absolutely. See you, Stuart.\nStuart: Yeah, yeah. Is he taller?\nHoward: At least my mother made her boyfriend climb out the window.\nScene: The apartment. \nPenny: All right, standard state fair pie-eating contest rules are, no hands, first one to clean the pan wins.\nAmy: On the count of three. One, two\u2026\nSheldon: Wait. I\u2019m a little concerned. Blueberries are rich in antioxidants.\nLeonard: So?\nSheldon: So, with all those antioxidants, what if I run out of oxidants?\nLeonard: Sheldon, we haven\u2019t won a game all night. Now, you either stick your face in that pie or I\u2019m gonna stick that pie in your face.\nSheldon: That\u2019s rude.\nAmy: One, two, three, eat.\nHoward: Hey, guys, guess who\u2019s back from space.\nAll: Not now!\nSheldon: Oh, ow, blueberry in my nose, blueberry in my nose!\nLeonard: Snort it down and keep eating!\nScene: A diner.\nWaitress: You look familiar.\nHoward: I don\u2019t think so.\nWaitress: Yeah, I just saw you on the news. You\u2019re an astronaut.\nHoward: Yes. Yes, I am.\nWaitress: Good for you. How about a piece of cheesecake on the house?\nHoward: Oh, thank you so much. I\u2019ve been having the worst night. I just got back, and my friends don\u2019t care, my wife\u2019s sick, I went to my mom\u2026\nWaitress: You want the cheesecake or not?\nHoward: Yes, please. (Sings) And I think it\u2019s gonna be long, long time till touchdown brings me \u2019round again to find I\u2019m not the man they think I am at home, oh, no, oh, no, I\u2019m a rocket man. (Sneezes) Perfect.\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "5_22": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The cafeteria. Sheldon laughs to himself.\nSheldon: I wish you could all be inside my head. The conversation is sparkling. (Pause) Fine, I\u2019ll tell you. A lichen is an organism made up of two separate species, fungi and algae. If you could merge with another species, what species would you pick and why? Hint, there is a right answer. None of you will get it.\nRaj: Okay, uh, I\u2019d pick swan because, uh, the resulting hybrid would have the advanced industrial civilization of a human and the long graceful neck I\u2019ve always dreamed of having.\nSheldon: Wrong. Leonard?\nLeonard: Horse, but mostly just for the height. A little bit for the genital girth.\nSheldon: Wrong, and let\u2019s keep it clean, shall we?\nHoward: Kangaroo, uh, I\u2019d be a Kanga-Jew. The first of my people to dunk a basketball.\nLeonard: Also instead of just living in your mother\u2019s house, you could actually live inside her body.\nSheldon: Clever, but also wrong. No, the best organism for human beings to merge with is the lichen itself. That way, you\u2019d be human, fungus, and algae. Triple threat. Like three-bean salad.\nLeonard: Give me one circumstance in which that would be useful.\nSheldon: All right, picture this, a beautiful outdoor concert. Now, as a human, I appreciate Beethoven. As a fungus, I have a terrific view, growing out of a towering maple tree. And no thank you, expensive concessions. Because as an algae, I\u2019ll just snack on this sunlight.\nRaj: He got us again.\nLeonard: No, he didn\u2019t.\nRaj: Anyway, if it\u2019s okay with you, we should talk about Howard\u2019s bachelor party.\nSheldon: Well, seems like a bit of a let down after our lichen conversation, but, what do you know, you\u2019re half swan.\nRaj: I\u2019ve been doing some research on strippers. One agency I spoke to, said I could get us a great price if we\u2019re flexible on age range and number of limbs.\nHoward: Sounds like loads of fun, but I promised Bernadette no strippers.\nRaj: You don\u2019t want strippers? You\u2019re the king of strippers. The one club in North Hollywood named a pole after you.\nHoward: What can I tell ya, I\u2019m not into that stuff any more.\nLeonard: Good for you, Howard. I\u2019m proud of you. And still, you\u2019re the first one of us to get married. We have to do something special.\nSheldon: You know Germans have an interesting pre-wedding custom.\nHoward: Well, it\u2019s probably not for me.\nRaj: Maybe we can go up to Napa Valley. They\u2019ve got that wine train.\nSheldon: Boo, wine! But yay, trains. I\u2019m in.\nRaj: Anyway, it\u2019s a beautiful time of year. Uh, you travel through the vineyards. There\u2019s a tasting on board. And all the wild flowers are in bloom. It\u2019s magic.\nLeonard: Look at that, in 30 seconds, we went from hiring women to being them.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The stairwell.\nPenny: So, I hear you and the lost boys are having a bachelor party tonight.\nLeonard: Yeah, just going to a restaurant, get some steaks and scotch. Nothing to worry about.\nPenny: Why should I worry?\nLeonard: Well, I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s a bachelor party. There could be strippers. Wouldn\u2019t that make you a little jealous?\nPenny: Oh, come on Leonard, it\u2019s you. What\u2019s going to happen? I mean, even if there was a stripper, all you\u2019d do is avoid eye-contact and maybe offer to help her kid with his homework.\nLeonard: Hey, I am a young man in his sexual prime. Under the right conditions, I-I-I am capable of just, really crazy stuff.\nPenny: Really? What is the craziest thing you\u2019ve ever done with a woman? And the time you and I had sex in the ocean does not count.\nLeonard: Oh, come on, that\u2019s got to count. There was a really strong undertow, we could have died.\nPenny: Well, have fun tonight.\nLeonard: Oh, I will. There is no telling what might happen.\nPenny: Yeah, there is.\nLeonard: You know, there\u2019s nothing wrong helping some woman\u2019s kid get through their S.A.T.\u2019s.\nScene: A restaurant.\nLeonard: Hey, I got to hand it to Raj, he found a really nice spot to have a bachelor party.\nSheldon: It\u2019s not bad. Unless you compare it to a train; then it stinks.\nLeonard: Are you drinking whisky?\nSheldon: Indeed. If I\u2019m to participate in the social convention that is the stag night, then I must embrace all its components, including tobacco, swear words, and yes, alcohol. Jeepers! That\u2019s yucky.\nLeonard: Whoa, it\u2019s a little early to start dropping J-bombs, don\u2019t you think?\nWil Wheaton: Hey, you guys.\nLeonard: Oh, hey, Wil. Nice of you to make it out tonight for Howard.\nWil: Well, it was either this or another hot tub party at George Takei\u2019s house.\nSheldon: I\u2019m confused. I thought since our reconciliation, I was your friend in this group.\nWil: Oh, I\u2019m friends with Howard too.\nSheldon: Oh. I guess you\u2019re just friends with anybody. (Drinks) Aagh!\nStuart: Hey, uh, Leonard, things are a little tight at the comic book store. I might need some help covering my share of the check.\nLeonard: Oh, yeah, no worries.\nStuart: And maybe a few bucks for the valet.\nLeonard: Oh, all right.\nStuart: And gas money to get home.\nLeonard: Yeah, sure.\nStuart: Great. You know what? This is my grandfather\u2019s watch.\nLeonard: Oh.\nStuart: 18-carat gold, got it in Europe during the war.\nLeonard: Wow, that\u2019s very nice.\nStuart: Mm-hmm. A hundred bucks and it\u2019s yours.\nRaj: Hey, everybody! The bachelor boy has arrived! For he\u2019s a jolly good fellow\u2026\nAll (joining in): For he\u2019s a jolly good fellow, for he\u2019s a jolly good fellow, which nobody can deny.\nKripke: Yes, yes, yes. He\u2019s a jowwy good fewwow. What time do the stwippers awwive?\nHoward: Actually, Barry, we\u2019re not going to have strippers tonight.\nKripke: Ah, then what the fwig did I get two hundwed dowwaws in singles out for?\nStuart: You want to buy a watch?\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment.\nAmy (into a mini-cam): This is Maid of Honour Amy Farrah Fowler, bringing you the wedding activities just weeks out from the big day. Let\u2019s check in with a beautiful, radiant young woman, and her friend who\u2019s about to get married. Ladies, can you tell us what you\u2019re doing?\nBernadette: Um, these are gift bags we\u2019re going to put in the hotel rooms of our out-of-town guests. This is a map of Pasadena. This is a list of local restaurants. And then, for Howie\u2019s relatives, we have antihistamines, antacids, and medicine for diarrhoea and constipation.\nPenny: Yeah, we labeled them stop and go.\nAmy: All right, pivoting to the big question. Bernadette, on your wedding night you\u2019ll be consummating your marriage. What do you think your first sexual position will be as husband and wife?\nBernadette: Amy, please.\nAmy: Keeping in mind that whoever\u2019s on top may set the tone for the marriage.\nPenny: Okay, show\u2019s over.\nAmy: Hey, they may conceive a child on their wedding night. Don\u2019t you think the kid might get a kick out of knowing how it happened?\nPenny: I don\u2019t care. Ask her things like are you going to take Howard\u2019s name? Not who\u2019s going to sit on who?\nBernadette: I\u2019ve actually been thinking I\u2019m going to hyphenate: Bernadette Mary-Ann Rostenkowski-Wolowitz.\nPenny: Nice. You know, you should totally get BernadetteMaryAnnRostenkowskiWolowitz.com before someone snaps it up.\nBernadette: Howard already took care of it. Plus, he set up our beautiful wedding website with cute little facts about our family histories. Do you know, for a while in Poland, my family and his family were neighbours.\nPenny: Oh, that\u2019s cool.\nAmy: No, it\u2019s not. I\u2019ll explain it to you later.\nScene: The restaurant.\nRaj: May I have your attention, please? We are hear tonight to celebrate the upcoming nuptials of my best friend Howard Wolowitz.\nAll: Hear! Hear!\nSheldon: And, apparently, Wil Wheaton\u2019s best friend.\nWil: Sheldon\u2026\nSheldon: Talk to the hand.\nRaj: Does anyone have any words they\u2019d like to say about our man of the evening?\nSheldon: Yeah, I do. (All groan). As is the tradition, I have prepared a series of disrespectful jokes which generate humour at Howard\u2019s expense. Prepare to have your ribs tickled. Howard, I always thought you\u2019d be the last one of us to ever get married, because you are so short and unappealing. Am I right? Let\u2019s see here. Oh, seriously though, Howard, you\u2019re actually one of the most intelligent people I know. And that\u2019s a zinger, because you\u2019re not. I\u2019ve always thought that you\u2019d make someone a fine husband someday. Assuming you\u2019d be able to get the parts, and develop the engineering skills to assemble them, which I don\u2019t see as likely. Hacha! Okay, let me see here. Okay, kidding aside, Howard, you are a good friend. And I wish you nothing but happiness. Bazinga, I don\u2019t!\nLeonard: Sheldon\u2026\nSheldon: Doubleazinga! I do! Good luck following that.\nLeonard: So, Howard Wolowitz tying the knot. Leaving his crazy bachelor days behind. He was a wild one. Well, I guess we all kind of were. I remember this one time, I was with this girl at the beach. We were in the ocean and we started making out. I know, it was crazy. I wasn\u2019t even wearing my Aquasocks. Then\u2026\nKripke: Nobody cares, Hofstadter. Wwap it up.\nLeonard: Right. To Howard.\nAll: To Howard.\nLeonard: I totally had sex in the ocean.\nStuart: Okay, I\u2019ll go. Howard, when I think about you and Bernadette starting this wonderful life together, I can\u2019t help but get a little choked up. I mean, look at you. You have everything. Look at me. I\u2019m 37. I sleep in the back of a comic book store, and I have the bone density of an 80-year-old man. To Howard.\nRaj: Yeah, to Howard. Um, uh, who\u2019s next?\nKripke: I\u2019ll go. Howard, I\u2019m gonna say something to you that evewybody\u2019s thinking but no one has the couwage to say out woud. When you invite a man to a bachewor pawty, the impwication is, there will be stwippews. Maybe not compwetewy nude, but at weast pasties and G-stwings. That\u2019s not unweasonable.\nRaj: Hear, hear.\nAll: Hear, hear.\nRaj: Okay, uh, anybody else? Huh? No? Okay, it all comes down to me, the best man. Ooh! This grasshopper is kicking my ass-hopper. Okay, when I first came to this country, I-I didn\u2019t know how to behave or how to dress, or what was cool, I was pretty lonely. But then I met Howard, and suddenly, my life changed, because we could be lonely together. This man became my whole world.\nKripke: Yeah, nice speech, Fwancine. (Tucks a dollar in Raj\u2019s pants.) \nRaj: I\u2019m not done, but thank you. (Raj puts the dollar on the table. Stuart steals it.) I think back to all the good times we had, like, uh, when we went camping and spent that night telling each other all our secrets. I told him I\u2019m addicted to pedicures and he told me he lost his virginity to his cousin.\nHoward: She was my second cousin.\nSheldon: And the first woman you ever disappointed sexually. Ba-da-bazinga!\nRaj: Oh, oh, yeah, and then there was the time when Leonard and I took Howard to Las Vegas and paid a hooker to pretend she was Jewish and that she wanted his little kosher pickle. Of all the Howard humping hookers stories, that one\u2019s my favourite!\nHoward: Okay, buddy, that\u2019s it. Sit down.\nRaj: Oh, oh, what about that tubby girl in the Sailor Moon costume at Comic-con?\nHoward: Don\u2019t remember. Please sit down.\nRaj: The only threesome I\u2019ve ever had in my life, and I\u2019m proud to say it was with this man right here.\nHoward: Oh, please shut up.\nRaj: Oh, oh, don\u2019t get me wrong, nothing happened with me and Howard. There was about 200 pounds of Sailor Moon between us.\nWil (filming on his phone): Oh, Internet, this is so going all over you.\nSheldon: Jeepers, I\u2019m drunk.\nScene: Bernadette\u2019s car.\nHoward: Thank you for picking us up. There\u2019s a warning, right there, on the scotch bottle. You cannot be operatin\u2019 heavy machinery after you had a snootful of this, laddie!\nBernadette: Funny. You boys have a nice time?\nHoward: Yeah, it was great. And low-key, like I promised. No hanky-panky, no strippers. Just the guys telling jokes.\nBernadette: That\u2019s nice.\nHoward: How about you? Did you have a fun night? Yeah, we, uh, made gift bags, had wine, and then went online and saw this.\nRaj\u2019s Voice: Of all the Howard humping hookers stories, that one\u2019s my favourite.\nRaj: You know, we\u2019re not that far from my apartment. If you stop the car, I can walk from here.\nBernadette: You ain\u2019t goin\u2019 anywhere, Threeway.\nHoward: Bernadette, listen\u2026\nBernadette: You lied to me. You said you told me about all the girls you\u2019ve been with, but you never mentioned your cousin, the prostitute or Raj!\nRaj: Seriously, you don\u2019t even have to stop the car. Anything under ten miles an hour and I can combat-roll into the street.\nHoward: Okay, just to set the record straight, I didn\u2019t hire the prostitute, she was a gift from him. Shame on you, Raj. That is not how we treat women in this country.\nBernadette: Don\u2019t you try and blame this on him.\nRaj: Thank you, Bernadette.\nBernadette: Zip it, pervert!\nScene: Bernadette\u2019s apartment.\nBernadette: I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do. I\u2019m supposed to marry Howard in a couple of weeks and I\u2019m not sure I even know who the man is any more.\nAmy: I\u2019m curious what\u2019s bothering you most, the borderline incest, the prostitute or group sex with the girl dressed as the children\u2019s cartoon?\nPenny: Amy, remember when we went over things that would be helpful and things that wouldn\u2019t?\nAmy: Right. And that was\u2026\nPenny: Not.\nBernadette: When I first met Howard, he seemed so innocent to me, just a sweet little guy who lives with his mother.\nPenny: Well, if that\u2019s what you like, I\u2019ll take you to the comic book store, the place is full of \u2019em.\nBernadette: Wait a minute. You set me up with Howard. Did you know about all the creepy stuff he was into?\nPenny: Well, a little. You hear stuff.\nBernadette: Why didn\u2019t you tell me\nPenny: Well, I was gonna, but I didn\u2019t think it would go past the first date. Then, when it did, I thought for sure it wouldn\u2019t go past you meeting his mother. Definitely not past the two of you sleeping together. I mean, the warning signs were there, this is really on you.\nBernadette: My God! I thought you were my friend. (Runs to bedroom)\nAmy: I don\u2019t think that was helpful.\nScene: The apartment. Howard is on the phone.\nHoward: Hi, Bernie, it\u2019s me again. Please call me back.\nRaj: Dude, I am so sorry.\nHoward: It\u2019s not your fault, it\u2019s mine. I did all that stuff, not you.\nLeonard: Actually, you did do one of them together.\nSheldon: Here.\nHoward: What is this?\nSheldon: You\u2019re upset. The convention is to bring an upset person a hot beverage.\nHoward: No, but what is it?\nSheldon: Chicken broth. It seemed culturally appropriate. Also, there was a single cube of chicken bouillon in the cupboard when I moved in and it\u2019s been bothering me for the last eight years. So, as they say, two birds.\nHoward: I don\u2019t know what my next move is.\nLeonard: Well, Howard, I don\u2019t know much about women.\nHoward: Yeah?\nLeonard: No, uh, that, that\u2019s it. I don\u2019t know much about women. Raj, you got anything?\nRaj: I\u2019ve got the phone number of the tubby girl from Comic-Con.\nHoward: I\u2019m not calling the girl from Comic-con.\nRaj: All right. More Sailor Moon for me.\nSheldon: I just threw up the bachelor party.\nScene: Bernadette\u2019s apartment.\nPenny: Please come out, Bernadette. Let\u2019s talk through this.\nBernadette: No, leave me alone.\nAmy: Perhaps you should give him a taste of his own medicine. Do you have a cousin who you find attractive?\nPenny: Amy.\nAmy: Hey, you introduced him to the sleazebag. I\u2019m just trying to clean up your mess.\nHoward (at the door): Oh, hi.\nPenny: Hey.\nHoward: I need to talk to Bernadette.\nPenny: Well, I don\u2019t think she wants to talk to anyone right now.\nHoward: All right, well, could you at least give her a message?\nPenny: Yeah, sure, I guess.\nHoward: Tell her I\u2019m really sorry, and if she doesn\u2019t want to marry me, I get it. But what I really want her to know is the guy that she\u2019s disgusted by, is the guy that I\u2019m disgusted by, too. But that guy doesn\u2019t exist any more, he\u2019s gone, and the reason is because of her. So, if this relationship is over, let her know that she made me a better man, and tell her thank you.\nPenny: Oh, my God, Howard. That\u2019s the most beautiful thing I\u2019ve ever heard. And it came out of you.\nBernadette: Howie?\nHoward: Penny has a message for you.\nBernadette: I heard. Your voice, not unlike your mother\u2019s, travels through walls.\nHoward: Do you want me to go?\nBernadette: No. Come here. I\u2019m still really mad at you.\nHoward: I get that.\nBernadette: Is there anything else about your past I should know?\nHoward: Couple things, but, you know, most of them happened overseas. I\u2019ll tell you later.\nBernadette: Okay.\nHoward: So, is the wedding still on?\nBernadette: Yeah, the wedding\u2019s still on. (They hug)\nAmy: Oh, thank God. I\u2019m still a maid of honour. (Joins in the hug)\nPenny: Oh, what the hell. (Joins in too)\nAmy: This is kind of hot.\nScene: The laundry room. Leonard enters in his dressing gown.\nLeonard: Hello.\nPenny: What\u2019s with the robe?\nLeonard (taking it off): I\u2019m gonna have sex with you right here, right now, on that washing machine.\nPenny: No, you\u2019re not.\nLeonard: Come on, please.\nPenny: If you want to do something, you can help me fold this sheet.\nLeonard: Folding a sheet in my underwear, still pretty crazy.\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "1_5": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The Cheesecake Factory\nSheldon: Alright, I\u2019m moving my infantry division, augmented by a battalion of Orcs from Lord of the Rings, we flank the Tennessee Volunteers, and the North once again wins the Battle of Gettysburg.\nHoward: Not so fast, remember the South still has two infantry divisions, plus Superman and Godzilla.\nLeonard: No, no, no, no, Orcs are magic, Superman is vulnerable to magic, not to mention, you already lost Godzilla to the Illinois Cavalry and Hulk.\nRaj: Why don\u2019t you just have Robert E. Lee charge the line with Shiva and Ganesh.\nPenny: Hi, you guys ready to order?\nHoward: Hang on, honey. Shiva and Ganesh? The Hindu Gods against the entire Union army?\nLeonard: And Orcs!\nPenny: I\u2019ll be back.\nRaj: Excuse me, Ganesh is the remover of obstacles, and Shiva is the destroyer. When the smoke clears, Abraham Lincoln will be speaking Hindi and drinking mint juleps. \nPenny: Alright, my boss says you either have to order, or leave and never come back. \nHoward: What do you recommend for someone who worked up a man-sized appetite from a morning of weight training and cardio-funk?\nPenny: A shower. \nHoward: I\u2019ll take the heart smart platter.\nPenny: Alright, thank you, and Sheldon.\nSheldon: We don\u2019t eat here, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s good.\nPenny: Well, it\u2019s all good. \nSheldon: Statistically unlikely. \nLeonard: Just get a hamburger, you like hamburgers.\nSheldon: I like the hamburgers where we usually have hamburgers, you can\u2019t make the assumption that I\u2019ll like the hamburgers here. \nLeonard: I\u2019m sorry. Give him a hamburger. \nPenny: Uh, which one, the Classic Burger, the Ranch House Burger, the Barbecue Burger or the Kobe burger?\nSheldon: Can\u2019t we just go to Big Boy? They only have one burger. The Big Boy. \nPenny: The Barbecue Burger is like the Big Boy. \nSheldon: Excuse me, in a world that already includes the Big Boy, why would I settle for something like a Big Boy?\nPenny: Because you are not at Big Boy!\nSheldon: Fine, I\u2019ll have the Barbecue Burger. \nLeonard: Make it two. \nSheldon: Waitresses don\u2019t yell at you at Big Boy. \nLesley (entering): Hey Leonard, hi guys. \nLeonard: Hey Lesley. \nLesley: I didn\u2019t know you ate here.\nSheldon: We don\u2019t. This is a disturbing aberration. \nLeonard: Lesley, this is Penny, she lives across the hall from Sheldon and me. \nHoward: And walks in quiet beauty like the night. \nPenny: Howard, I\u2019ve asked you not to do that. \nLeonard: Lesley and I do research together at the University. \nPenny: Oh, wow, a girl scientist. \nLesley: Yep, come for the breasts, stay for the brains. So, I\u2019m glad I ran into you, the physics department string quartet needs a new cellist. \nLeonard: What happened to Elliot Wong?\nLesley: He switched over to high energy radiation research, had a little mishap, and now the other guys are uncomfortable sitting next to him. So, are you in?\nLeonard: Yeah, sure, why not.\nLesley: Great, we rehearse on Tuesdays at your place.\nLeonard: Why at my place?\nLesley: Yeah, the department of energy said our regular space is kind of a hot zone. Nice meeting you.\nPenny: Yeah, you too. Leonard, I didn\u2019t know you played the cello?\nLeonard: Yeah, my parents felt that naming me Leonard and putting me in advanced placement classes wasn\u2019t getting me beaten up enough. \nHoward: If you\u2019re into music, I happen to be a human beatbox. \nPenny: Really? (Howard performs some of the worst beatboxing imaginable.) I\u2019m actually not that into music. So hey, your friend\u2019s really cute, anything going on with you two. \nLeonard: Lesley? No, no-oh, what are you kidding?\nSheldon: He asked her out once, it was an embarrassing failure. \nLeonard: Thank you Sheldon.\nSheldon: Oh, I\u2019m sorry, was that supposed to be a secret?\nPenny: Oh, that\u2019s too bad, you guys would make a cute couple. \nRaj: Oh dear.\nHoward: What\u2019s the matter?\nRaj: She didn\u2019t take my order.\nHoward: How can she take your order when you\u2019re too neurotic to talk to her.\nRaj: Nevertheless, this will be reflected in her tip. \nScene: The stairwell of the apartment building.\nLeonard: What did Penny mean, you\u2019d make a cute couple?\nSheldon: Well I assume she meant that the two of you together would constitute a couple that others might consider cute. An alternate, and somewhat less likely interpretation, is that you could manufacture one. As in, oh look, Leonard and Lesley made Mr and Mrs Goldfarb, aren\u2019t they adorable. \nLeonard: If Penny didn\u2019t know that Lesley had already turned me down then that would unambiguously mean that she, Penny, thought that I should her, Lesley, out, indicating that she, Penny, had no interest in me asking her, Penny, out. But because she did know that I had asked Lesley out and that she, Lesley, had turned me down then she, Penny, could be offering consolation. That\u2019s too bad, you would have made a cute couple. But while thinking, good, Leonard remains available. \nSheldon: You\u2019re a lucky man, Leonard. \nLeonard: How so?\nSheldon: You\u2019re talking to one of the three men in the Western hemisphere capable of following that train of thought. \nLeonard: Well, what do you think.\nSheldon: I said I could follow it, I didn\u2019t say I cared.\nCredit sequence.\nScene: The apartment living room. The string quartet are practising. \nLesley: I admire your fingering. \nLeonard: Thank you.\nLesley: Maybe some time you can try that on my instrument. \nTime jump\nLesley: Goodnight guys, good job.\nMale string quartettist: Thanks.\nFemale string quartettist: See you next week.\nLeonard: That was fun, Lesley, thanks for including me. \nLesley: You\u2019re welcome. If you\u2019re up for it we could practise that middle section again.\nLeonard: Uh, sure, why not. \nLesley: Just so we\u2019re clear, you understand that me hanging back to practise with you is a pretext for letting you know that I\u2019m sexually available. \nLeonard: Really?\nLesley: Yeah, I\u2019m good to go. \nLeonard: I thought you weren\u2019t interested in me.\nLesley: That was before I saw you handling that beautiful piece of wood between your legs. \nLeonard: You mean my cello?\nLesley: No, I mean the obvious crude double entendre. I\u2019m seducing you.\nLeonard: No kidding?\nLesley: What can I say, I\u2019m a passionate and impulsive woman. So how about it?\nLeonard: Gee, uh\u2026\nLesley: Is it the waitress?\nLeonard: Penny? What about her?\nLesley: Well, I thought I saw your pupils dilate when you looked at her, which, unless you\u2019re a heroin addict, points to sexual attraction.\nLeonard: Well, I did have a poppy seed bagel for breakfast, which could give a positive urine test for opiates but certainly not dilate my pupils, so I guess there\u2019s no point in bringing it up. \nLesley: You and the waitress then?\nLeonard: No. No, there\u2019s nothing going on between Penny and me.\nLesley: So, you\u2019re open to a sexual relationship?\nLeonard: Yeah. Yeah, I guess I am. \nLesley: Good. \nLeonard: Yeah, yeah it is good. Did you want to start now?\nLesley: Why don\u2019t we finish the section first.\nLeonard: Oh. Okay. A little musical foreplay. Terrific. \n(They play, gradually going faster and faster.) \nLeonard: I\u2019m good, I\u2019m good to go. \nLesley: Me too. (Exit in direction of bedrooms.)\nScene: The hallway, Sheldon scuttles out of apartment door and crosses to Penny\u2019s. Knocks on it urgently.\nPenny (opening door): Oh, hey Sheldon, what\u2019s going on?\nSheldon: I need your opinion on a matter of semiotics.\nPenny: I\u2019m sorry?\nSheldon: Semiotics. The study of signs and symbols, it\u2019s a branch of philosophy related to linguistics.\nPenny: Okay, sweetie, I know you think you\u2019re explaining yourself, but you\u2019re really not. \nSheldon: Just come with me.\nJump to the pair of them standing outside Leonard\u2019s bedroom door. Bryan Adams \u201cHave You Ever Loved A Woman\u201d is emerging. There is a tie on the bedroom door. \nSheldon: Well?\nPenny: Well what?\nSheldon: What does it mean?\nPenny: Oh, come on, you went to college.\nSheldon: Yes, but I was eleven.\nPenny: Alright, look, a tie on the doorknob usually means someone doesn\u2019t want to be disturbed because they\u2019re, you know, getting busy. \nSheldon: So you\u2019re saying Leonard has a girl in there.\nPenny: Well, either that or he\u2019s lost his tie rack and gotten really into Bryan Adams. \nLesley (voice off): Oh Leonard, you magnificent beast. \nPenny: We really shouldn\u2019t be standing here. \nSheldon (entering living room): This is very awkward.\nPenny: Oh, come on, you know, Leonard\u2019s had girls over before, right?\nSheldon: Oh, yes, but there\u2019s usually planning, courtship and advance notice. Last time I was able to book a cruise to the Arctic to see a solar eclipse. \nPenny: Wait, you had to leave the state because your roommate was having sex?\nSheldon: I didn\u2019t have to, the dates just happened to coincide. \nPenny: So, do you know who\u2019s in there?\nSheldon: Well, there\u2019s Leonard. (Picking up violin case) And he\u2019s either with Lesley Winkle or a 1930\u2019s gangster. \nPenny: Hmmm. Good for him. Good for Leonard. Okay, night.\nSheldon: No, no, wait, hold on. \nPenny: What\u2019s the matter?\nSheldon: I don\u2019t know what the protocol is here. Do I stay, do I leave? Do I wait to greet them with a refreshing beverage? \nPenny: Gee, Sheldon, you\u2019re asking the wrong girl. I\u2019m usually on the other side of the tie. \n(Sheldon looks lost for a moment. The pulls out his mobile phone and dials.)\nSheldon: Hi, Leonard. It\u2019s me, Sheldon. In the living room. I just, I wanted you to know I saw the tie. Message received. You\u2019re welcome. You carry on. Give my best to Lesley. \nScene: In Leonard\u2019s Bedroom. Leonard wakes up next to Lesley, puts on glasses and grins.\nScene: Living room, Sheldon is sleeping on the sofa, with his head on Lesley\u2019s Violin case.\nSheldon: Big boy! (Wakes up, looks at watch, wraps self in blanket, walks towards kitchen) Someone touched my board. Oh God, my board. Leonard! Leonard!\nLeonard (entering): Hey, what\u2019s the matter? \nSheldon: My equations, someone\u2019s tampered with my equations. \nLeonard: Are you sure?\nSheldon: Of course I\u2019m sure. Look at the beta-function of quantum chrono-dynamics, the sign\u2019s been changed. \nLeonard: Oh yeah. But doesn\u2019t that fix the problem you\u2019ve been having?\nSheldon: Are you insane? Are you out of your mind? Are you\u2026. hey look, that fixes the problem I\u2019ve been having. \nLesley (entering): You\u2019re welcome. \nSheldon: You did this?\nLesley: Yeah, I noticed it when I got up to get a glass of water, so I fixed it, now you can show that quarks are asymptotically free at high energies. Pretty cool, huh?\nSheldon: Cool?\nLesley: Listen, I got to hit the lab. Thanks for a great night. \nLeonard: Thank you, I\u2019ll see you at work. \nSheldon: Uh-duh, hold on, hold on!\nLesley: What?\nSheldon: Who told you you could touch my board?\nLesley: No-one.\nSheldon: I don\u2019t come into your house and touch your board.\nLesley: There are no incorrect equations on my board. \nSheldon: Oh, that is so\u2026 so\u2026\nLesley: I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019ve got to run, if you come up with an adjective, text me. (Leaves). \nSheldon: Inconsiderate, that is the adjective, inconsiderate. \nScene: The hallway. \nLeonard (exiting the apartment): You can stare at your board all day Sheldon, she\u2019s still going to be right. \nSheldon (inside): I\u2019m not staring, I\u2019m mulling.\nPenny: Oh, hey Leonard.\nLeonard: Oh, hi.\nPenny: So, how\u2019s it going?\nLeonard: Pretty good. \nPenny: Just pretty good, I\u2019d think you were doing very good. \nLeonard: Pretty, very, there\u2019s really no objective scale for delineating variations of good, why do you ask?\nPenny: Well, a little bird told me that you and Lesley hooked up last night. \nLeonard: Sheldon!\nSheldon: I\u2019m coming.\nPenny: So, is it serious, do you like her?\nLeonard: Wuh, I don\u2019t\u2026. th-th-th-that\u2019s really two different questions, uh, I\u2019m not\u2026. Sheldon, we have to go! \nSheldon: Boy, you\u2019re wound awfully tight for a man who just had sexual intercourse. \nPenny: Alright, well, I\u2019ll talk to you later, but, I am so happy for you Leonard. \nLeonard: Thank you. What did she mean, she\u2019s happy for me? Is she happy because I\u2019m seeing someone, or is she happy because she thinks that I\u2019m happy, because anyone who cared for someone would want them to be happy, even if the reason for their happiness made the first person unhappy. You know, because the second person, though happy, is now romantically unavailable to the first person.\nSheldon: Do you realise I may have to share a Nobel Prize with your booty call?\nLeonard: You know what, I\u2019m being ridiculous. But who cares what Penny thinks, Lesley is a terrific girl, she\u2019s attractive, we like each other, she\u2019s extremely intelligent.\nSheldon: She\u2019s not that intelligent.\nLeonard: She fixed your equation.\nSheldon: She got lucky.\nLeonard: You don\u2019t believe in luck.\nSheldon: I don\u2019t have to believe in it for her to be lucky. \nLeonard: Regardless, I have a chance at a real relationship with Lesley, I\u2019m not going to pass that up for some hypothetical future happiness with a woman who may or may not want me to be happy with a woman who is currently making me happy. \nSheldon: Leonard?\nLeonard: Yeah. \nSheldon: I still don\u2019t care. \nScene: Leonard and Lesley\u2019s lab. \nLeonard: Hey, Lesley.\nLesley: Careful\u00a0 Leonard, liquid nitrogen, 320 degrees below zero. \nLeonard: Brrrr. Why are you smashing a flash frozen banana.\nLesley: Because I\u2019ve got a bowl of Cheerios and I couldn\u2019t find a knife.\nLeonard: So anyway (puts arms around her) Hello.\nLesley: Uh, what are you doing?\nLeonard: Just extending the intimacy. Do you want to slip over to the radiation lab and share a decontamination shower?\nLesley: Okay, uh, what exactly do you think\u2019s going on between us?\nLeonard: I\u2019m not sure, but I think I\u2019m about to discover how the banana felt. \nLesley: Listen, Leonard, neither of us are neuroscientists but we both understand the biochemistry of sex, I mean, dopamine in our brains is released across synapses causing pleasure. You stick electrodes in a rat\u2019s brain, give him an orgasm button, he\u2019ll push that thing until he starves to death.\u00a0 \nLeonard: Who wouldn\u2019t? \nLesley: Well, the only difference between us and a rat is that you can\u2019t stick an electrode in our hypothalamus. That\u2019s where you come in. \nLeonard: Yeah, well, I\u2019m just glad to be a part of it. So what happens now?\nLesley: Well, I don\u2019t know about your sex drive, but I\u2019m probably good till New Years. \nLeonard: Oh. Okay. Thank you.\nLesley: Thank you!\nLeonard: You want to make plans for New Years.\nLesley: Woah, Leonard, please, you\u2019re smothering me. \nLeonard (leaving): Sorry.\nHoward: Hey, look, it\u2019s Doctor Stud!\nLeonard: Doctor what?\nHoward: The blogosphere is a-buzzing with news of you and Lesley Winkle making eine kleine bang-bang music. \nLeonard: Wha\u2026 how did it get on the internet?\nHoward: I put it there. \nLeonard: Well, how did you know about it?\nRaj: A little bird told us. Apparently you are a magnificent beast. \nLeonard: Well, that part\u2019s true! \nScene: The Cheesecake Factory.\nSheldon: You know, I think I may have misjudged this restaurant. \nLeonard: No kidding.\nSheldon: I won\u2019t go out on a limb, but I think we may be looking at my new Tuesday hamburger. \nLeonard: Your old Tuesday hamburger will be so broken hearted. \nSheldon: Way ahead of you. I was thinking of moving Big Boy to Thursdays, and just dropping Soup Plantation. \nLeonard: Really?\nSheldon: Yeah, the name always confused me anyway, Soup Plantation. You can\u2019t grow soup. \nPenny: So, how\u2019s everything. \nSheldon: Terrific, you\u2019ll be happy to know that I plan to come here every Tuesday night for the foreseeable future.\nPenny: Really, oh yay!\nSheldon: Who do I speak to about permanently reserving this table? \nPenny: Um, I don\u2019t know, a psychiatrist? So hey, how are things with you and Lesley? \nLeonard: Oh, to be honest, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work out. \nPenny: Oh, oh that\u2019s too bad. Well hey, don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m sure there is someone out there who is just right for you. (Walks away smiling).\nLeonard: Well what did she mean by that? Was that just a generic platitude or was that a subtle bid for attention? \nSheldon: You know why this hamburger surpasses the Big Boy? This is a single decker hamburger whereas the Big Boy is a double decker. This has a much more satisfying meat to bun to condiment ratio. \nLeonard: Are you even listening to me?\nSheldon: Of course I\u2019m listening. Blah blah, hopeless Penny delusion, blah blah blah.\nLeonard: Okay then. You know, you can grow the ingredients for soup. (Sheldon nods). \nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "8_8": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The cafeteria.\nLeonard: Oh, hey, oh, we ran into your mom at Benihana last night.\nHoward: Oh, yeah, she loves that place. Every time they flip a shrimp in the air, she practically leaps out of her seat to catch it. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t take her to SeaWorld.\nLeonard: I know you-you don\u2019t want to hear it, but she was there with Stuart.\nHoward: That\u2019s fine. I don\u2019t care.\nRajj: It doesn\u2019t bug you when they go out on dates?\nHoward: They\u2019re not dating. They\u2019re just two friends who went out to dinner.\nRaj: And then went back to the home they share where they probably fell asleep in the matching pajamas she got them because they both just love penguins.\nHoward: Hey, lots of people wear matching pajamas who aren\u2019t dating.\nRaj: Like who?\nHoward: Like you and your dog.\nLeonard: Don\u2019t rule out the dating.\nHoward: Fine, it bothers me. You happy?\nSheldon: You think you\u2019ve got problems. The gibbon is the only member of the ape family not classified as a great ape.\nHoward: How is this helpful?\nSheldon: All the non-human apes are classified as great apes except one. That means taxonomists created the entire category of lesser ape just to single out the poor gibbon as the weird kid on the playground. Now there\u2019s a hairy little fellow with a genuine beef.\nLeonard: But the gibbon doesn\u2019t know what it\u2019s categorized as. It doesn\u2019t even know it\u2019s called a gibbon.\nSheldon: True. Sorry, kid, you\u2019ve got it worse than a gibbon.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: Penny\u2019s Apartment. \nAmy: Hi.\nPenny: Hey.\nBernadette: We brought snacks for movie night.\nPenny: Oh, great. I don\u2019t suppose you also brought napkins, clean bowls, utensils and a roll of toilet paper.\nBernadette: Right here.\nPenny: Ah, You guys are the best.\nAmy: What\u2019s with the clothes?\nPenny: Well, with all the new stuff I bought for work, I needed to make room in my closet.\nAmy: I meant why are they folded? But whatever. Ooh, what\u2019s this?\nPenny: That, believe it or not, is my prom dress.\nBernadette: Wow, you still have it? I just assumed it was balled up in the corner of a barn somewhere.\nPenny: What kind of teenager did you think I was?\nBernadette: Slutty.\nAmy: Easy.\nPenny: The word is popular.\nBernadette: How was your prom? Did you go?\nAmy: No, but I was on clean-up crew.\nPenny: Aw, that\u2019s sad.\nAmy: No, it was okay. The DJ let me dance one slow song with my mop before he shut down. Whenever I see a bucket of dirty water, I still hear Lady in Red.\nBernadette: My prom was pretty terrible, too. I was so excited about my date, but it turned out he only asked me \u2019cause he liked my friend. He spent the whole night talking about her.\nAmy: Okay, we get it, you had a friend and a date. Stop bragging.\nPenny: Doesn\u2019t matter. Prom is silly anyways.\nBernadette: Easy for you to say; you probably went with the captain of the football team.\nPenny: No. I just made out with him a little while his date was puking.\nAmy: My date would\u2019ve had to clean that up.\nBernadette: Ooh, I have an idea. Maybe we can have, like, a prom do-over.\nAmy: Oh, that would be so much fun. We could decorate the roof and make the guys wear tuxedos.\nBernadette: Ooh, and get our hair done, and slow-dance.\nPenny: Okay, guys, trust me, as someone who\u2019s been to, like, seven proms, it is never as good as you want it to be.\nAmy: You went to seven proms?\nPenny: Yeah, let\u2019s see. Uh, four Under the Seas, two Enchanted Evenings, and one Night to Remember that I cannot remember for the life of me.\nScene: The apartment.\nHoward: Hey.\nRaj: Hey.\nLeonard: Hey, where\u2019s Bernadette?\nHoward: She and Amy are out dress shopping for their prom thing.\nRaj: Oh, yeah, I got that Evite. Ever since I saw Pretty in Pink, I\u2019ve wanted to go to an American prom. But then I saw Carrie, and I did not want to go to an American prom. But then I saw Never Been Kissed, and I\u2019m back on the prom bandwagon. This prom thing\u2019s been a real roller coaster.\nHoward: Bernie\u2019s really excited. I could tell because her voice got so high, the beagle next door started howling.\nRaj: Did you go to your prom?\nSheldon: No. I had a date with a proper education. Instead of a tuxedo, I dressed myself in good habits. Instead of spiked punch, I enjoyed the intoxicating flavour of knowledge. Instead of dancing in a gym, I shook my bootyto the seductive rhythms\u2026\nPenny: Okay, okay.\nShldon: \u2026of AP Calculus.\nRaj: How come you\u2019re not shopping with Amy and Bernadette?\nLeonard: Let me guess, you think the whole idea is lame?\nPenny: Well, who cares what I think? What do you think?\nLeonard: Hmm, to be honest, it\u2019s kind of a dream come true to go to even a fake prom with a woman as beautiful as you.\nPenny: Ugh, thanks a lot.\nLeonard: What?\nPenny: Well, now I can\u2019t blow this thing off without being a bitch.\nRaj: That sounds like a yes.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s apartment.\nBernadette: Ooh, every single person RSVP\u2019d yes. This is so exciting. Isn\u2019t this exciting?\nHoward: Yep.\nBernadette: Look, even Stuart\u2019s bringing a date. I wonder who it is.\nHoward: You know exactly who it is. He\u2019s gonna bring my mom. Why did you even invite him?\nBernadette: Because he\u2019s our friend, and you two need to get along. And why can\u2019t he take your mom? You took her to your prom.\nHoward: I didn\u2019t take her, she was a chaperone.\nBernadette: I saw a picture of you two dancing together.\nHoward: What was I gonna do? They were playing our song. I can\u2019t take this anymore.\nStuart (on phone): Hello.\nHoward: Stuart, we have to talk. This thing with you and my mom, I hate it. It\u2019s making me crazy. You and I were friends for years, and now you\u2019re bringing my mother to a party I\u2019m going to? What the hell?\nStuart: I\u2019m not bringing your mother, I have a date.\nHoward: Oh, so now you\u2019re cheating on my mother?\nStuart: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What are you talking about? There\u2019s nothing weird going on with me and your mother.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Stewie, your bath is getting cold!\nStuart: I got to go, bye.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment.\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Penny? (Knock, knock, knock) Penny? (Knock, knock, knock) Penny? (Knock, knock, knock) Penny? (Knock, knock, knock) Penny?\nPenny: You knocked more than usual.\nSheldon: Next time I might be in a rush, it\u2019s good to have a few in the bank.\nPenny: Okay, what\u2019s up?\nSheldon: I\u2019d like to discuss this party that Amy and Bernadette are throwing. Since you and I are both reluctant to go, I think I\u2019ve come up with a perfect way for us to enjoy it.\nPenny: Great, how?\nSheldon: We pretend we\u2019re aliens. I\u2019m not the best at reading facial cues, but I\u2019m gonna say that you love it and want to hear more. Now, in the beloved novel Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy, an alien named Ford Prefect pretended to be human in order to blend in so that he could write an entry about Earth for The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy, which is a travel book within the actual book, which is also called The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy.\nPenny: Okay, just one question. What?\nSheldon: My point is, pretending to be an alien is a valuable coping mechanism I\u2019ve used many times. I did it the first time I went to see you in a play. You had no idea Commander Umfrumf of Ceti Alpha Three was in the audience. Oh, don\u2019t worry, he gave you seven thumbs up.\nPenny: Here\u2019s a question, as an alien pretending to be human, are you planning to engage in any post-prom mating rituals with Amy?\nSheldon: There are post-prom mating rituals?\nPenny: Not always. Unless your date drives a van with an air mattress, then always.\nSheldon: Well, if it\u2019s part of the prom experience, then I\u2019m open to it.\nPenny: You\u2019re kidding.\nSheldon: I may be an alien, but I have urges. If Amy wants to copulate by firing her eggs into space, well, then, I will happily catch them with the reproductive sac on my upper flermin. I\u2019m not the best at reading facial cues, but I can see that you\u2019re a little turned on.\nScene: The apartment. \nLeonard: You know, if you\u2019re not gonna learn how to do this, they make some pretty good clip-ons.\nSheldon: Bruce Wayne doesn\u2019t wear a clip-on.\nLeonard: Bruce Wayne doesn\u2019t make his roommate tie it for him.\nSheldon: His name is Alfred, and, yes, he does.\nLeonard: There, perfect.\nSheldon: What, are you sure? It\u2019s my first prom, I want to do it correctly.\nLeonard: I thought you were gonna pretend to be an alien.\nSheldon: I was, but Penny didn\u2019t want to. You didn\u2019t want to. Bernadette, Amy, Koothrappali and Wolowitz didn\u2019t want to. And even I knew it was weird to hire somebody.\nLeonard: Was that a flask?\nSheldon: Yes. I\u2019ve decided to embrace all of the traditions associated with prom, including spiking the punch.\nLeonard: You\u2019re gonna put alcohol in the punch?\nSheldon: Oh, no, this is pomegranate juice. It\u2019s all the fun of high school high jinks with the cell-protecting zip of antioxidants.\nLeonard: If you had ripped jeans and a leather jacket, you\u2019d be like the toughest kid on the Disney Channel. So, anything else planned for tonight?\nSheldon: Oh, everything. Getting our picture taken, slow-dancing, being elected prom king. Pointing out that kings aren\u2019t elected. It\u2019s gonna be off the hook.\nLeonard: And while you\u2019re at it, I know that at this age your hormones are raging, but just because all your friends are having sex doesn\u2019t mean you have to.\nSheldon: Why would you say that?\nLeonard: You know, \u2019cause, \u2019cause a lot of people lose their virginity on prom night.\nSheldon: Penny implied the same thing. Is this true?\nLeonard: Just relax, it\u2019s a joke. You don\u2019t have hormones.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment. \nLeonard: Wow, you look amazing.\nPenny: Thank you, so do you.\nAmy: Sheldon, you look so handsome.\nSheldon: Thank you.\nPenny: Sheldon, doesn\u2019t Amy look hot? That\u2019s got to put some starch in the upper flermin.\nAmy: What\u2019s that?\nLeonard: Oh, it\u2019s a scaly genital organ that grows between his shoulder blades. Try not to touch it when you\u2019re dancing.\nSheldon: Excuse me.\nAmy: Where are you going?\nSheldon: I can\u2019t do this. And for your information, Leonard, the upper flermin doesn\u2019t grow between my shoulder blades, it grows out of the belly button on my neck.\nLeonard: He\u2019s right, I was thinking of the lower flermin.\nScene: A limo.\nRaj: Ooh, I\u2019ll, uh, text Stuart, let him know we\u2019re close.\nBernadette: That\u2019s a neat tattoo.\nEmily: Oh, thanks, it\u2019s Sally from Nightmare before Christmas.\nBernadette: Aw, that movie\u2019s so cute.\nHoward: Do you like her because you both have red hair?\nEmily: Uh, a little, but more that she\u2019s covered in scars and can pull her own limbs off and sew them back on.\nBernadette: I like Cinderella.\nEmily: Did you know, in the original book, the sisters cut off their toes with knives in order to fit in the glass slipper?\nBernadette: I like Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo.\nRaj: Hey, here comes Stuart and his date.\nEmily: Oh, she\u2019s cute.\nHoward: Oh, my God.\nBernadette: What?\nHoward: That\u2019s Jeanie.\nBernadette: That\u2019s Jeanie?\nEmily: Who\u2019s Jeanie?\nHoward: Don\u2019t say it.\nRaj: That\u2019s Howard\u2019s cousin that he had sex with.\nHoward: She is my second cousin. We were 15, I just said, don\u2019t say it.\nEmily: No, it\u2019s okay. He told me that story a long time ago.\nHoward: Raj.\nRaj: It was our first date, there was an awkward silence. What was I supposed to say?\nScene: The rooftop. \nPenny: Oh, it\u2019s beautiful.\nLeonard: Oh, the girls really did a nice job.\nPenny: Aw, I know I wasn\u2019t into this before, but I\u2019m so glad I get to take you to your first prom.\nLeonard: What makes you think I didn\u2019t go to my prom? I went.\nPenny: Well, who\u2019d you go with?\nLeonard: I took a little lady I like to call loneliness.\nPenny: Aw.\nLeonard: Oh, it\u2019s all right. We ended up having a threesome with her friend humiliation, so\u2026\nPenny: Well, if I would have been there and saw you alone, I would\u2019ve asked you to dance.\nLeonard: No, you wouldn\u2019t have.\nPenny: Well, you don\u2019t know that.\nLeonard: It was before my growth spurt.\nPenny: What, that already happened?\nLeonard: Very funny.\nPenny: Well, you wouldn\u2019t have asked me either.\nLeonard: I would have asked you. In my head. On the way home. While I was having a good cry.\nScene: Sheldon\u2019s bedroom.\nAmy: Sheldon, can I come in?\nSheldon: I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea.\nAmy: Why not?\nSheldon: According to an online message board, I may be having a panic attack. SoccerMom09 had similar symptoms. But to be fair, the twins were a real handful that day.\nAmy: You\u2019re making me worry. What\u2019s going on?\nSheldon: What\u2019s going on is we\u2019re about to go to a prom. And there\u2019s a great deal of pressure on young couples like us to engage in what Mr. Bob Eubanks called making whoopee.\nAmy: What pressure? All I said was you look handsome. Can you please open the door?\nSheldon: It\u2019s not just that. Leonard and Penny also made comments about it. And I\u2019m not blind. Even I looked twice when I saw my posterior in these tuxedo pants.\nSceme: The limo.\nStuart: So, I met Jeanie at your Aunt Gladys\u2019. She passed me the Manischewitz, I took one look at this punim, and I almost plotzed on the kugel.\nRajj: Is this what I sound like when I talk about India?\nHoward: So, my mother\u2019s okay with this?\nJeannie: Why would your mother have a problem with me and Stuart?\nHoward: \u2018Cause they have a weird, inappropriate relationship.\nJeannie: Weirder than what you and I did in my dad\u2019s Corolla?\nRaj: This is so messed up.\nEmily: I know, I\u2019m having the best time.\nHoward: Why would you even come to this? Didn\u2019t you know I\u2019d be here?\nJeannie: It was a long time ago, Howard.\nStuart: And you\u2019re only second cousins, who cares?\nBernadette: So, you knew and you brought her anyway?\nStuart: Oh, so she\u2019s good enough for Howard, but not for me?\nHoward: Yeah.\nBernadette: Yeah, go have weird relationships with your own mother and cousin. This is his turf.\nHoward: Yeah.\nScene: The rooftop.\nPenny: Well, I might not have asked you to dance then, but I will ask you now.\nLeonard: There\u2019s no music.\nPenny: I don\u2019t care. We\u2019ll make our own music.\nLeonard: My God, who\u2019s the dork now? Thank you for wearing your flats.\nPenny: Thank you for wearing your heels.\nLeonard: Look at me. Dancing with the prettiest girl at the prom.\nPenny: Want to take a picture of us and send it to your old friends in the chess club?\nLeonard: I sent them a bikini shot of you years ago. This is nice. I kind of wish no one else was coming.\nPenny: I know, me, too. But it will be fun to have a prom without all the drama.\nScene: The limo.\nBernadette: Howie, get off of him.\nHoward: Not until he stops humping his way up my family tree.\nScene: Sheldon\u2019s bedrooom.\nAmy: Sheldon, this is silly. I\u2019m not missing another prom. I\u2019m going upstairs now. Good-bye.\nSheldon: I really did think you looked pretty.\nAmy: You did?\nSheldon: Yes. So much so that I started to panic.\nAmy: Well, you can relax. Just because you think I look pretty doesn\u2019t mean we have to spend the night together.\nSheldon: Were you hoping we would because it\u2019s prom?\nAmy: I\u2019m always hoping. But tonight I just wanted to have a nice time with you. And maybe dance with someone who has arms.\nSheldon: Thank you for understanding.\nAmy: Of course I understand. Sheldon, there\u2019s something else I\u2019ve been wanting to say, but before I do, I just, I want you to know that you don\u2019t have to say it back. I know you\u2019re not ready, and I don\u2019t want you to say it just because social convention dictates\u2026\nSheldon: I love you, too.\nAmy: You said it.\nSheldon: There\u2019s no denying I have feelings for you that can\u2019t be explained in any other way. I briefly considered that I had a brain parasite. But that seems even more farfetched. The only conclusion was love. I know what\u2019s happening. This is a panic attack. SoccerMom09 says to lie down with your feet elevated.\nAmy: Okay.\nSheldon: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Just because I love you doesn\u2019t mean girls are allowed in my room.\nScene: The rooftop.\nRaj: Okay. Here we go, say cheese. Iskip) Say cheese. Iskip) Say cousin.

The guys are studying a complex chart on the whiteboard.\nLeonard: Hmmm.\nSheldon: The problem appears to be unsolvable.\nRaj: Maybe you could run some computer simulations.\nHoward: There are too many variables. It would take forever.\nLeonard: We\u2019ve got to be missing something. Let\u2019s start again. The movie is playing here at 7:20, here at 7:40, here at 8:10 and here at 8:45.\nSheldon: Right, these theatres have to be eliminated.\nLeonard: Why? They\u2019re state-of-the-art digital projection, 20-channel surround sound.\nSheldon: Yes, but they have no Icee machines. Despite my aggressive letter-writing campaign, I might add.\nRaj: What about the multiplex here? The seats are terrific.\nSheldon: They have Twizzlers instead of Red Vines. No amount of lumbar support can compensate for that.\nLeonard: Well, it\u2019s gonna take at least an hour to eat, and I don\u2019t see a Sheldon-approved restaurant proximate to a Sheldon-approved theatre.\nRaj: We could eat after the movie.\nSheldon: Unacceptable, the delay would result in tomorrow morning\u2019s bowel movement occurring at work.\nRaj: Hang on, hang on. There\u2019s a 7-Eleven here. We smuggle Slurpies, which are essentially Icees, in under our coats, after having a pleasant meal either here, here or here.\nHoward: Wow. I don\u2019t see how we missed that.\nSheldon: Excuse me, in what universe are Slurpies Icees?\nRaj: That\u2019s how we missed it.\nLeonard: Sheldon, would you be prepared, on a non-precedential basis, to create an emergency ad-hoc Slurpie-Icee equivalency?\nSheldon: Oh, Leonard, you know I can\u2019t do that.\nHoward: Okay, I guess we only have one option.\nRaj: Yep, I don\u2019t see any way around it.\nLeonard: Bye, Sheldon.\nHoward: See ya.\nRaj: Later, dude.\nSheldon: They\u2019re right, it was the only option.\nCredits sequence.\n\u00a0\nScene: The hallway. Sheldon is opening the apartment door. Penny comes running up stairs.\nPenny: Ooh, ooh, shut the door, shut the door.\nSheldon: Why?\nPenny: Just do it! (Penny runs in. Sheldon shuts door. Penny opens door again) Get inside and shut the door.\nSheldon: Well, you didn\u2019t specify.\nPenny: Is Leonard around?\nSheldon: He went to the movies without me. It was the only option. I\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t understand which social situation this is. Could you give me some guidance as to how to proceed?\nPenny: The building manager\u2019s showing an apartment downstairs, and I haven\u2019t paid my rent.\nSheldon: Oh, I see. Penny, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m comfortable harbouring a fugitive from the 2311 North Los Robles Corporation.\nPenny: It\u2019s no big deal. I\u2019m just a little behind on my bills because they cut back my hours at the restaurant and my car broke down.\nSheldon: If you recall, I pointed out the \u201ccheck engine\u201d light to you several months ago.\nPenny: Well the \u201ccheck engine\u201d light is fine. It\u2019s still blinking away. It\u2019s the stupid engine that stopped working. It cost me like twelve hundred dollars to fix it.\nSheldon: You know, it occurs to me you could solve all your problems by obtaining more money.\nPenny: Yes, it occurs to me, too.\nSheldon: Hang on a moment. (He opens a jar. Snakes jump out. He then pulls out a large wedge of money) Here. Take some. Pay me back when you can.\nPenny: Wow, you got a lot of money in there.\nSheldon: That\u2019s why it\u2019s guarded by snakes. Take some.\nPenny: Don\u2019t be silly.\nSheldon: I\u2019m never silly. Here.\nPenny: No, I can\u2019t.\nSheldon: Don\u2019t you need money?\nPenny: Well, yeah, but\u2026\nSheldon: This is money I\u2019m not using.\nPenny: But what if you need it?\nSheldon: My expenses account for 46.9% of my after-tax income. The rest is divvied up between a small savings account, this deceptive container of peanut brittle and the hollowed-out buttocks of a superhero action figure who shall remain nameless for his own protection. Or her own protection. Take some.\nPenny: Really? I mean, are you sure?\nSheldon: I see no large upcoming expenditures unless they develop an affordable technology to fuse my skeleton with adamantium like Wolverine.\nPenny: Are they working on that?\nSheldon: I sincerely hope so.\nPenny: Okay. Well, thank you. Oh, God, no, I can\u2019t. Sheldon honey, I don\u2019t want things to be weird between us.\nSheldon: Won\u2019t it also be weird if I have to say hello to you every morning on my way to work and you\u2019re living in a refrigerator box and washing your hair with rain water?\nPenny: I\u2019ll pay you back as soon as I can.\nSheldon: Of course you will. It\u2019s impossible to pay me back sooner than you can. Assuming you subscribe to a linear understanding of time and causality.\nPenny: I\u2019m regretting this already.\nScene: Entering the lobby of the building.\nSheldon: You know, I\u2019ve given the matter some thought, and I think I\u2019d be willing to be a house pet to a race of super-intelligent aliens.\nLeonard: Interesting.\nSheldon: Ask me why.\nLeonard: Do I have to?\nSheldon: Of course. That\u2019s how you move a conversation forward.\nLeonard: Why?\nSheldon: The learning opportunities would be abundant. Additionally, I like having my belly scratched.\nLeonard: Hey, Penny. How was work?\nPenny: Great. I hope I\u2019m a waitress at the Cheesecake Factory for my whole life.\nSheldon: Was that sarcasm?\nPenny: No.\nSheldon: Was that sarcasm?\nPenny: Yes.\nSheldon: Was that sarca..\nLeonard: Stop it!\nSheldon: Penny, you appear to have a package here.\nPenny: Oh, thanks. This must be the beret I ordered. A couple of months ago. It was back-ordered.\nSheldon: Did you know the beret is an example of piece of women\u2019s fashion adapted from male military uniforms? Another fascinating example is the epaulet.\nLeonard: He\u2019s not lying, he does find that fascinating.\nPenny: Okay, whatever. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m running up and down the streets just buying myself berets. I bought one, like, a month ago, and it was back-ordered, look, it finally arrived, all right?\nSheldon: All right.\nPenny: Oh, my God, would you just get off my case?\nLeonard: Weird.\nSheldon: Oh, good, that was an unusual interaction. I wasn\u2019t sure.\nLeonard: Did you guys have an argument?\nSheldon: No.\nLeonard: Well, you clearly did something to aggravate her.\nSheldon: I\u2019m at a loss. If you like, you can review my daily log of social interactions and see if there\u2019s a blunder I overlooked.\nScene: The apartment. \n\u00a0\nLeonard: Here you go. Oh, you owe me another two dollars. The price of mu-shu pork went up.\nHoward: It\u2019s getting tougher and tougher to be a bad Jew.\nLeonard: Here you go, Penny. Shrimp with lobster sauce.\nPenny: Thank you, Leonard. What\u2019s my share?\nLeonard: Don\u2019t worry about it. It\u2019s my treat.\nPenny: No, really, how much?\nLeonard: It\u2019s, whatever. Ten, eleven dollars.\nPenny: Well, which is it, ten or eleven?\nLeonard: Fourteen fifty, but it\u2019s no biggie, you\u2019ll get the next one. (Raj whispers something to Howard)\nPenny: What?\nHoward: He was just wondering if he wore skintight jeans and a tank top if he\u2019d get his shrimp lo mein for free.\nPenny: What are you saying? That I\u2019m using my body to get dinner? That I\u2019m some kind of Chinese food prostitute?\nHoward: Yeah, Raj, what are you saying?\nPenny: \u2018Cause let me tell you something, buddy, I pay my own way in this world, okay? I don\u2019t rely on anybody! (Raj runs out of the room) What was that about?\nHoward: He has a nervous bladder when he\u2019s stressed out. Kind of like a puppy.\nPenny: Here, Leonard, ten, eleven, twelve, uh, fourteen dollars.\nLeonard: It was fourteen fifty, but it\u2019s okay.\nSheldon: Oh, good. Dinner\u2019s here.\nPenny: Yes, dinner\u2019s here, and I\u2019m having some. I\u2019m having takeout food.\nSheldon: Okay.\nPenny: You\u2019re damn right it\u2019s okay. I\u2019ve been having leftovers at the restaurant for like four days, and I wanted something different. So sue me.\nSheldon: Forgive me, Penny, but that would be the very definition of a frivolous lawsuit.\nPenny: Sheldon, look, I will pay you back as soon as I can. You just have to give me more time.\nLeonard: Oh, wait, you lent her money?\nPenny: She needed money. You seem under pressure. Did I not lend you a sufficient amount? Because I can give you more.\nPenny: Oh, you know, you would just love that, wouldn\u2019t you? Yeah. You would just love to open up your little snake can and throw some money at the girl who can\u2019t pay her bills.\nLeonard: Where are you going?\nPenny: Going home, where I won\u2019t be interrogated like a criminal. I forgot my fortune cookie.\nSheldon: In case either of you have larceny in your heart, you should know that I\u2019ve moved my money out of the snake can.\nLeonard: But if you\u2019re ever short, there\u2019s always a couple of fifties in Green Lantern\u2019s ass.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment. \n\u00a0\nLeonard: Hey.\nPenny: Hey.\nLeonard: A little mood lighting, huh?\nPenny: Yeah. When I didn\u2019t pay my bill, the Department of Water and Power thought I would enjoy the ambience.\nLeonard: Yeah, they\u2019re very considerate that way.\nPenny: I used Sheldon\u2019s money to pay my rent, then I had like fourteen dollars left over.\nLeonard: Fourteen dollars, huh?\nPenny: Put it back in your pocket, or I\u2019ll find some other place to put it.\nLeonard: Back in the pocket it goes. Look, you do understand that Sheldon really doesn\u2019t care when he gets the money back. It\u2019s actually one of the few idiosyncrasies that doesn\u2019t make you want to, you know, kill him.\nPenny: Yeah, well, that\u2019s not really my big problem.\nLeonard: So you\u2019re a little behind on your bills. Everybody gets behind on their bills.\nPenny: Yeah, I know, it\u2019s just, this wasn\u2019t the plan, it wasn\u2019t supposed to go this way.\nLeonard: Well, what was the plan?\nPenny: Um, waitress for six months and then become a movie star.\nLeonard: Was there a plan B?\nPenny: TV star.\nLeonard: It\u2019s probably not as bad as you think. Let\u2019s take a look. Maybe we can find some corners to cut. Oh, here\u2019s something, if you don\u2019t have electricity, then you probably don\u2019t need cable. Just a suggestion. 170 dollars for acting classes?\nPenny: Oh, no, I can\u2019t give up my acting classes. I\u2019m a professional actress.\nLeonard: You\u2019ve had an acting job where you got paid?\nPenny: That is not the definition of professional.\nLeonard: Actually, it kind of\u2026 let\u2019s keep looking. Whoa, what\u2019s eighteen hundred dollars to the Los Angeles County Superior Court?\nPenny: Oh, that\u2019s nothing.\nLeonard: Nothing? It sounds like you got caught speeding going 4,000 miles an hour.\nPenny: Well, remember Kurt?\nLeonard: Your ex-boyfriend?\nPenny: Yeah. He got arrested for taking a whiz on a cop car.\nLeonard: What?\nPenny: He was drunk.\nLeonard: I would hope so.\nPenny: Anyway, he had a bunch of outstanding tickets and a bench warrant, so I, you know, I paid his fines.\nLeonard: Did he pay you back?\nPenny: No, but he will.\nLeonard: And that\u2019s based on the inherent credit-worthiness of people who get drunk and urinate on police vehicles?\nPenny: Leonard, I\u2019m not gonna call up Kurt and ask him for money.\nLeonard: Well what are you gonna do?\nPenny: I don\u2019t know, but I may have to find a cheaper place to live.\nLeonard: Oh, no. Oh, you don\u2019t want to do that.\nPenny: Why not?\nLeonard: Well, moving is a big deal. You have to go to the supermarket and get boxes, and if they\u2019re not clean, then your books smell like melons, and it\u2019s just, like\u2026 Why don\u2019t you just get a roommate and stay here?\nPenny: Well, do you know anybody?\nLeonard: Well, I\u2019m sure the guy living with Sheldon wouldn\u2019t mind moving in with you.\nPenny: Oh, Leonard, honey, if we started living together, I wouldn\u2019t be able to keep my hands off you.\nLeonard: Really?\nPenny: And you thought my acting lessons were a waste of money.\nScene: The apartment.\n\u00a0\nHoward: Ugh. This mu-shu pork\u2019s burning a hole through my duodenum.\nRaj: Leviticus 11:3: \u201cOnly that which parteth the hoof and cheweth the cud among the beasts shall ye eat.\u201d\nHoward: Hey, do I mock you with the Bhagavad-Gita every time you scarf down a Whopper?\nLeonard: Hey, what\u2019s going on?\nRaj: We\u2019re on a quest through the Valley of Fire to acquire the sacred crown.\nHoward: You want the Valley of Fire? It\u2019s right here.\nLeonard: Hey, you guys want to go on a real live quest?\nSheldon: Outside? I just made cocoa.\nLeonard: \u2013 Come on. It\u2019ll be fun.\nHoward: What is it?\nLeonard: Do you guys remember Penny\u2019s ex-boyfriend Kurt? (They all hold their hands above their heads) Yeah, that\u2019s him. It turns out he owes Penny a lot of money, and I\u2019m gonna go get it from him.\nWho\u2019s with me?\nHoward: Ooh, double sixes.\nLeonard: Really? You\u2019re just gonna let me go by myself?\nRaj: Oh, cool, I got a sword.\nLeonard: I could use some help.\nRaj: Here.\nLeonard: You guys are unbelievable, you play a game to simulate adventure, but when there\u2019s real adventure out there in the real world, you just wimp out.\nSheldon: Leonard, do you not recall the last time we visited this gentleman, we returned home without pants?\nLeonard: I do.\nSheldon: Are you sure? Because your proposal suggests that you don\u2019t.\nLeonard: I\u2019m not afraid of him.\nSheldon: All right. Leonard fairly calls the question, who is in favour of abandoning our game and confronting Penny\u2019s steroid-infused ex-boyfriend in a suicidal mission to extract money from him? Say hi to Kurt for us.\nLeonard: Excuse me. When Frodo left the Shire to take the one ring to Mordor, didn\u2019t Samwise, Pippin and Merry go with him?\nSheldon: They did.\nLeonard: Well?\nSheldon: They had a terrible time of it, Leonard.\nRaj: Plus, no one stole their pants.\nLeonard: Fine. Just enjoy your little game. I\u2019ll make this quest on my own.\nHoward: Leonard, wait. Take a jacket, it\u2019s spritzing a little.\nLeonard: You guys suck. (Leaves. Comes back) Come on, please? He\u2019s so big.\nScene: Outside Kurt\u2019s door.\n\u00a0\nLeonard: Okay, is everyone clear on the plan?\nHoward: Yes. Koothrappali\u2019s going to wet himself, I\u2019m gonna throw up, Sheldon\u2019s gonna run away, and you\u2019re going to die. Shall we synchronize our watches?\nLeonard: Guys, there are four of us and one of him.\nSheldon: Which means his triumph will be even larger. Minstrels will write songs about him.\nLeonard: Okay, how about this? I\u2019ll do the talking, you just stand behind me and try to look formidable.\nRaj: I should\u2019ve peed before we left.\nKurt: Yeah?\nLeonard: Hi, Kurt.\nKurt: Lenny, right?\nLeonard: I don\u2019t really go by Lenny, but that\u2019s okay. Um, you remember Sheldon, Howard and Raj.\nKurt: No. What do you want?\nSheldon: You don\u2019t remember me? How could he not remember me?\nLeonard: Sheldon, not now.\nSheldon: I remember him.\nLeonard: Okay, here it is. Penny\u2019s in kind of a financial jam, and the money that you owe her would go a long way to solving her problems.\nKurt: And she sent you to get it from me?\nLeonard: No, no, she\u2019s too proud to ask for the money. I, on the other hand, feel you should honour your debt.\nKurt: You do?\nLeonard: Feel is a kind of a\u2026 it\u2019s a strong word. Um, I just think it would be a nice gesture on your part.\nKurt: She\u2019ll get it when she gets it.\nHoward: Well, there you go. Problem solved.\nRaj: A successful quest. Now let\u2019s go find a gas station with a clean bathroom.\nLeonard: No, the problem isn\u2019t solved. He just blew us off.\nSheldon: I\u2019ve got it. He didn\u2019t remember me because the last time we met I was in a Halloween costume.\nHoward: Come on, Leonard, let\u2019s go\nLeonard: No. You can leave if you want to. I\u2019m gonna see this through.\nHoward: Okay. (They leave) \nLeonard: I guess, technically, that was my fault. (Knocks) I\u2019m not leaving here without Penny\u2019s money.\nKurt: What happened to your backup?\nLeonard: I don\u2019t need backup. I have right on my side. And I\u2019m wearing cargo shorts under my pants.\nScene: Leonard\u2019s car.\nSheldon: Congratulations. You may not have succeeded in getting cash, but you did secure a formal acknowledgment of the debt. (Leonard has \u201cI owe Penny $1800, Kurt\u201d written on his forehead.) \n\u00a0\nHoward: Maybe we should have your head notarized.\nRaj: If anybody cares, I still have to pee.\nScene: Outside the apartment. Penny knocks. \nLeonard: Hey.\nPenny: Hey, is Sheldon here?\nLeonard: Yeah. Hang on. Sheldon!\nPenny: Nice hat.\nLeonard: It\u2019s kind of a fashionable look these days.\nPenny: Maybe if you\u2019re working on a tuna boat.\nSheldon: Hello, Penny.\nPenny: Sheldon, here is your money. Thank you very much. It helped a lot.\nSheldon: Sarcasm?\nPenny: No.\nSheldon: Darn. I can\u2019t seem to get the hang of that.\nLeonard: Hey, I know it\u2019s none of my business, but where did the money come from?\nPenny: Well, I cut back my expenses like you said and picked up a few more hours at the restaurant, but the biggest thing was, out of the blue, Kurt shows up and gives me the money he owes me.\nLeonard: Really? Did he say why?\nPenny: Yes, he said he was feeling guilty and wanted to do what was right.\nLeonard: That\u2019s it? Did he give any reason as to why he came to this moral epiphany?\nPenny: Nope. I just think he\u2019s really changed. We\u2019re having dinner tomorrow night, and I get to wear my new beret. Bye, guys.\nLeonard: Bye.\nSheldon: Well done, Leonard. The true hero doesn\u2019t seek adulation, he fights for right and justice simply because it\u2019s his nature.\nLeonard: Penny\u2019s hooking up with her jerk of an ex-boyfriend and I have indelible ink on my forehead!\nSheldon: That\u2019s your badge of honour, your warrior\u2019s wound, if you will. I was wrong, minstrels will write songs about you.\nLeonard: Great.\nSheldon (sings): There once was a brave lad named Leonard, with a fi-fi-fiddle-dee-dee.

A Central African power block is formed, colonizing North Africa and Europe. When war breaks out, no one can afford the luxury of a rhino. Kenya withers, Uganda triumphs.\nAmy: Correct. My turn.\nSheldon: In a world where a piano is a weapon, not a musical instrument, on what does Scott Joplin play The Maple Leaf Rag?\nAmy: Tuned bayonets.\nSheldon: Defend.\nAmy: Isn\u2019t it obvious?\nSheldon: You\u2019re right. My apologies.\nLeonard: What the hell are you guys playing?\nSheldon: It\u2019s a game we invented. It\u2019s called Counterfactuals.\nAmy: We postulate an alternate world that differs from ours in one key aspect and then pose questions to each other.\nSheldon: It\u2019s fun for ages eight to eighty. Join us.\nLeonard: All right. I like a good brainteaser. Give it a whirl.\nSheldon: You\u2019re in luck, this is an easy one. In a world where mankind is ruled by a giant intelligent beaver, what food is no longer consumed?\nLeonard: Uh, a BLT where the B stands for beaver? I don\u2019t know.\nSheldon: Leonard, be serious. We\u2019re playing a game here.\nLeonard: I can figure this out, let\u2019s see. Um, well, beavers eat tree bark. The only tree bark I know that humans consume is cinnamon. So, I\u2019ll say cinnamon.\nSheldon: Incorrect. Obviously, the answer is cheese Danish.\nLeonard: What?\nAmy: In a world ruled by a giant beaver, mankind builds many dams to please the beaver overlord. The low-lying city of Copenhagen is flooded. Thousands die. Devastated, the Danes never invent their namesake pastry. How does one miss that?\nLeonard: This is ridiculous. You\u2019re just making stuff up.\nAmy: Is he always like this when he loses?\nSheldon: Oh, yes. You should\u2019ve been here for the great Jenga tantrum of 2008.\nLeonard: You bumped the table and you know it.\nAmy: Perhaps it would be kinder to play a game more suited to his abilities. We\u2019ll close our eyes and count to ten while you hide.\nLeonard: I\u2019m going to my room.\nAmy: Very good, Leonard. But next time, don\u2019t tell us where you\u2019re hiding.\nCredits sequence. \n \nScene: The Cheesecake Factory\nLeonard: Did you guys see the paper in The American Physics Journal on supersolids? It\u2019s pretty interesting. This guy\u2019s working from a hypothesis where\u2026\nRaj: Spoiler alert! Spoiler alert.\nLeonard: What?\nRaj: Don\u2019t ruin it for me, man. I printed out a PDF to read on the potty.\nHoward: On the potty? What are you, five?\nRaj: It\u2019s a potty. What do you call it?\nHoward: Toilet.\nRaj: That\u2019s a little vulgar for the dinner table, don\u2019t you think?\nHoward: Oh, and potty is okay?\nRaj: Potty is innocent. Potty is adorable.\nHoward: What do you do in the potty, wee-wee?\nRaj: If I don\u2019t have to boom-boom.\nSheldon: Greetings. You all remember Amy Farrah Fowler.\nLeonard: Sure.\nHoward: Nice to see you.\nAmy: Hello.\nSheldon: Sorry we\u2019re late.\nAmy: I must take responsibility. I had to stop for feminine hygiene supplies.\nHoward: Ah, ah.\nLeonard: Okay.\nSheldon: I believe she\u2019s experiencing her menses.\nAmy: Actually, I\u2019m not. In order to avoid surprises, I wear them all the time.\nLeonard: Ah, ah.\nHoward: Okay. Toilet\u2019s sounding pretty good now, huh?\nPenny: Hey, look, it\u2019s Shamy.\nAmy: Shamy?\nSheldon: A juvenile amalgamation of our names. Sheldon and Amy, \u00a0Shamy.\nAmy: Oh. I don\u2019t like that. Don\u2019t do that.\nPenny: All righty. What\u2019s new?\nAmy: Well, just recently, I learned that you refer to us as Shamy, and I don\u2019t like that.\nPenny: I got it. But what I was going for was, you know, how\u2019s your life?\nAmy: Like everybody else\u2019s. Subject to entropy, decay and eventual death. Thank you for asking. Why is she not taking our order?\nSheldon: I should\u2019ve warned you, one has to navigate a labyrinth of social nonsense before one can be fed here.\nAmy: Really? I assumed an establishment called the Cheesecake Factory would function more efficiently.\nSheldon: It\u2019s how they lure you in. I believe it\u2019s called bait and switch.\nPenny: Okay, I\u2019m just gonna walk away, \u2019cause I don\u2019t want to be here.\nLeonard: So, this is nice. First time we\u2019ve all gotten together to eat.\nAmy: You\u2019re right, he\u2019s a festival of humdrum chitchat.\nLeonard: Okay, that\u2019s all I got. Howard, you\u2019re up.\nHoward: Um, tell us about your work, Amy.\nAmy: I doubt you\u2019d understand. Sheldon tells me you only have a master\u2019s degree.\nHoward: Raj, do you have any questions for Amy?\nAmy: I\u2019m curious as to why we\u2019re not eating alone.\nSheldon: They can\u2019t function without me. I\u2019m the social glue that holds this little group together. You\u2019re welcome.\nScene: The stairwell.\n \nLeonard: Listen, can I talk to you about your girlfriend?\nSheldon: She\u2019s not my girlfriend. She\u2019s a girl and she\u2019s my friend, but there\u2019s no touching or unsanitary exchange of saliva.\nLeonard: Got it.\nSheldon: Although, for the record, on one occasion, she licked her thumb to remove raspberry jelly from the corner of my mouth. It\u2019s an action we both regret to this day.\nLeonard: Uh-huh. Anyway, I\u2019m not sure she\u2019s the best fit for our little, how should we call it, rebel alliance.\nSheldon: Oh, I never identified with the rebel alliance. Despite their tendency to build Death Stars, I\u2019ve always been more of an empire man.\nLeonard: Yeah, not my point.\nSheldon: I know what your point is. You\u2019re intimidated by Amy\u2019s intellect. To that I say, buck up.\nLeonard: Okay, let me just get right to it. Amy is judgmental, sanctimonious and frankly just obnoxious.\nSheldon: So?\nLeonard: So we already have you for all that.\nSheldon: Are you suggesting I terminate my relationship with Amy?\nLeonard: No, no, of course not. Just have your relationship someplace else.\nSheldon: May I point out that for eight long months, I suffered in silence as your female companion filled our apartment with her off-key country music caterwauling, the unappetizing spectacle of her grinding a pumice stone against her calloused feet in our living room, and night after night of uninformative TV documentaries about the Jersey Shore.\nLeonard: Suffered in silence?\nSheldon: Yes. And I\u2019d thank you to do the same.\nLeonard: Really? Silence?\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment. \nRaj: Ah. Nothing makes beer taste better than cool clear Rocky Mountain spring water. Where are the Rocky Mountains, anyway?\nHoward: Philadelphia.\nRaj: Really? I thought they were out West someplace.\nHoward: Think about it, Raj. Where did the movie Rocky take place?\nRaj: Philadelphia. Okay, now I get it.\nPenny: So this is the plan? From now on, we\u2019re just gonna hide out in here to avoid the Shamy?\nRaj: I\u2019m very comfortable here. Penny, dear, why don\u2019t you shoot another silver bullet my way?\nPenny: Get one yourself.\nRaj: Ooh, somebody\u2019s been taking bitchy pills.\nPenny: God, he\u2019s an ass when he drinks.\nHoward: Oh, he\u2019s an ass when he doesn\u2019t. You just don\u2019t hear it.\nLeonard: I think we need to start entertaining the possibility that the Shamy could go on for years.\nRaj: Well, if that\u2019s the case, Penny will have to get satellite TV and maybe once a week run a vacuum through this place.\nPenny: I thought you were going to talk to Sheldon.\nLeonard: I did.\nPenny: Well, what\u2019d he say?\nLeonard: Well, he pointed out that he kinda, sorta had to put up with you.\nPenny: Kinda, sorta had to?\nLeonard: I didn\u2019t agree with him.\nPenny: Well, you defended me, right?\nLeonard: I tried, but (Penny starts rubbing her foot with a pumice stone) he made a fairly well-reasoned argument.\nHoward: You\u2019re not doing that right.\nPenny: What?\nHoward: Gimme.\nPenny: No.\nHoward: Trust me.\nPenny: No!\nHoward: I do this for my mom all the time. See? With the grain.\nPenny: Wow, that is better.\nHoward: And someday, when you have varicose veins, I\u2019ll show you how to massage them.\nScene: The University Cafeteria.\nRaj: Oh, God, never again.\nLeonard: I assume by never again, you mean never again will you drink all of Penny\u2019s beer, then run down to the gas station for a couple of 40s, a box of Slim Jims and the latest issue of Bombay Badonkadonks.\nRaj: I was homesick.\nHoward: The highlight of the evening was when you showed us your Bollywood break dancing skills. (Does a stereotyped impersonation of Bollywood dancing.)\nRaj: That\u2019s very offensive.\nHoward: Yeah, we all thought so.\nLeonard: Oh, no.\nHoward: What?\nLeonard: John and Yoko.\nHoward: More like Yoko and Yoko.\nSheldon: Greetings.\nLeonard: Hey.\nSheldon: I brought Amy here to show her some of the work I\u2019m doing.\nAmy: It\u2019s very impressive, for theoretical work.\nSheldon: Do I detect a hint of condescension?\nAmy: I\u2019m sorry, was I being too subtle? I meant compared to the real-world applications of neurobiology, theoretical physics is, what\u2019s the word I\u2019m looking for? Hmm, cute.\nLeonard and Howard together: Oooh!\nSheldon: Are you suggesting the work of a neurobiologist like Babinski could ever rise to the significance of a physicist like Clarke-Maxwell or Dirac?\nAmy: I\u2019m stating it outright. Babinski eats Dirac for breakfast and defecates Clarke-Maxwell.\nSheldon: You take that back.\nAmy: Absolutely not. My colleagues and I are mapping the neurological substrates that subserve global information processing, which is required for all cognitive reasoning, including scientific inquiry, making my research ipso facto prior in the ordo cognoscendi. That means it\u2019s better than his research, and by extension, of course, yours.\nLeonard: I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m-I\u2019m still trying to work on the defecating Clark Maxwell, so\u2026\nSheldon: Excuse me, but a grand unified theory, insofar as it explains everything, will ipso facto explain neurobiology.\nAmy: Yes, but if I\u2019m successful, I will be able to map and reproduce your thought processes in deriving a grand unified theory, and therefore, subsume your conclusions under my paradigm.\nSheldon: That\u2019s the rankest psychologism, and was conclusively revealed as hogwash by Gottlob Frege in the 1890s!\nAmy: We appear to have reached an impasse.\nSheldon: I agree. I move our relationship terminate immediately.\nAmy: Seconded.\nSheldon: There being no objections\u2026\nAll: No, uh-uh.\nSheldon: The motion carries. Good day, Amy Farrah Fowler.\nAmy: Good day, Sheldon Cooper.\nHoward: Women, huh? Can\u2019t live with them, can\u2019t successfully refute their hypotheses.\nSheldon: Amen to that.\nScene: The laundry room. \nPenny: Hey, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Hello.\nPenny: I hear you broke up with Amy.\nSheldon: A breakup would imply she was my girlfriend. She was a girl who was my friend who is now a girl who is not my friend.\nPenny: Wow. That\u2019s like the worst country song ever. So, how are you doing?\nSheldon: Regarding what?\nPenny: Amy.\nSheldon: I don\u2019t follow.\nPenny: Well, breakups, or whatever the hell this is, can be tough.\nSheldon: Penny, I assure you, I\u2019m fine. My relationship with Amy was purely intellectual. There were no emotional bonds, the severing of which would cause me any discomfort. The relationship simply outlived its utility, and I\u2019m continuing on with my life as before.\nPenny: Okay. Good.\nSheldon: Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I\u2019m off to buy a pussycat.\nScene: The cafeteria.\nLeonard: I gotta tell you guys, I\u2019m a little worried about Sheldon.\nHoward: We\u2019re all a little worried about Sheldon.\nLeonard: No, I mean since the Shamy hit a reef.\nHoward: Oh, I thought you were just making a generalization, you know, I\u2019m worried about Sheldon someday setting off a low-yield nuclear device because the cafeteria ran out of lime Jell-O.\nRaj: What does hit a reef mean?\nLeonard: Uh, went splitsville.\nRaj: Pardon?\nLeonard: Turned to boom-boom.\nRaj: Ah.\nLeonard: I think Sheldon really misses Amy.\nHoward: You should lend him your copy of Bombay Badonkadonks.\nLeonard: He got a cat to keep him company.\nRaj: You\u2019re kidding.\nLeonard: He takes it everywhere, to bed, to the bathroom.\nRaj: He takes the kitty to the potty?\nHoward: I thought we discussed the P-word.\nRaj: Don\u2019t try to change me, dude. I am what I am.\nSheldon: Oh, gentlemen.\nHoward: Hey. Aren\u2019t you going to introduce us to your little friend?\nSheldon: My apologies. Raj, Howard, I\u2019d like you to meet Dr. Robert Oppenheimer.\nHoward: Hello.\nRaj: Hi.\nSheldon: Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me, the father of the atomic bomb wants a saucer of milk.\nHoward: Okay, I get it. We\u2019re worried about Sheldon.\nLeonard: Yeah.\nScene: The apartment. Leonard arrives.\nLeonard: Hey. (Turns to see Sheldon now has five cats) Oh, no.\nSheldon: Robert Oppenheimer was lonely.\nLeonard: So you decided to get the whole Manhattan Project?\nSheldon: Yes. This is Enrico Fermi, Richard Feynman, Edward Teller, Otto Frisch, and Zazzles.\nLeonard: Zazzles?\nSheldon: I was going to name him Herman von Helmholtz, but he\u2019s so zazzy.\nLeonard: Okay, we need to talk.\nSheldon: About what?\nLeonard: Cats, Sheldon. You\u2019re clearly upset about Amy being gone, and you\u2019re trying to replace her with a bunch of cats.\nSheldon: Clowder.\nLeonard: What?\nSheldon: A group of cats is a clowder. Or a glaring.\nLeonard: Okay, yeah, fine.\nSheldon: It\u2019s the kind of thing you ought to know now that we have one.\nLeonard: Terrific. My-my point is you need to face up to what you\u2019re feeling with this breakup.\nSheldon: It wasn\u2019t a breakup. A breakup would imply that Amy was my girlfriend.\nLeonard: Okay, I got it, I got it, she\u2019s not your girlfriend. Now listen to me. I know about loneliness. I know about trying to replace someone with other stuff. When I broke up with Penny, I got back into my cello, I built a bunch of model rockets, I got those weightlifting gloves and that five-pound dumbbell.\nSheldon: You didn\u2019t break up, she dumped you.\nLeonard: She didn\u2019t dump me. It was mutual!\nSheldon: I was there. She dumped you.\nLeonard: Okay, fine. Live with cats. Be like my Aunt Nancy. She had dozens of them. And do you know what happened after she died? They ate her.\nSheldon: You don\u2019t have to sell me on cats, Leonard. I\u2019m already a fan. All right, fellas, who\u2019s in the mood for Fancy Feast? Well, that\u2019s not fancy at all.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: Hi, Mrs. Cooper. Thanks for coming.\nMrs Cooper: Where is he?\nLeonard: He\u2019s in his bedroom.\nMrs Cooper: Now, when you said on the phone he broke up with a girl, you meant an actual girl, not something you kids whipped up in a lab?\nLeonard: No, she\u2019s real.\nMrs Cooper: Did they sin?\nLeonard: No, no, it\u2019s not like that. It\u2019s, uh, I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like. But there is something I should prepare you for.\nMrs Cooper: Oh, relax, Leonard, I have raised that boy. I\u2019ve seen him at his best, I\u2019ve seen him at his worst. There\u2019s nothing he can do that\u2019ll surprise me.\nLeonard: Hold on to that thought. (Knocks on Sheldon\u2019s bedroom door)\nSheldon: Come in. (They enter. The room is full of cats.)\nLeonard: Surprise.\nSheldon: Mom, what an unexpected pleasure.\nMrs Cooper: My, my, that\u2019s a powerful smell.\nSheldon: I\u2019d like you to meet Oppenheimer, Frisch, Panofsky, Feynman, Weisskopf\u2026\nMrs Cooper: Yeah, I get it. You got a lot of cats and you gave \u2019em cute Jewish names.\nSheldon: What are you doing here?\nMrs Cooper: Leonard called, and he said that you were pining for a young lady.\nSheldon: Oh, that\u2019s preposterous. I\u2019m not pining over anyone.\nMrs Cooper: Oh, lambchop, we can quibble what to call it, but I think we can both agree it\u2019s creepy.\nSheldon: I do not agree. Cats make wonderful companions. They don\u2019t argue or question my intellectual authority, and this little guy here, I think you\u2019ll find to be quite zazzy.\nMrs Cooper: You should have called sooner.\nScene: The kitchen.\nMrs Cooper: Shelly! Dinner\u2019s ready!\nSheldon: Coming!\nMrs Cooper: No cats!\nSheldon: Aw.(Enters to find Amy) What is she doing here?\nMrs Cooper: I called her.\nAmy: Your mother thinks you might be losing your mind over me. As a neurobiologist, I was curious.\nSheldon: Well, rest assured, I am in full possession of my faculties.\nLeonard (pretending to sneeze): 25 cats!\nMrs Cooper: Oh, God bless you, dear. Sheldon, sit down. Let\u2019s talk.\nSheldon: All right, but you\u2019re not fooling me. Whenever you say we have to talk, it means you want me to listen.\nMrs Cooper: Then stop talking.\nSheldon: Yes, ma\u2019am.\nMrs Cooper: Now, the reason I called Amy over was to find out what type of person she is. And after chatting a bit, I have to say that while she is a perfectly unique young woman, you two are definitely not suited for each other.\nSheldon: That\u2019s a peculiar conclusion. By any standard, Amy is more similar to me than anyone I\u2019ve ever met.\nMrs Cooper: Oh, I\u2019m sorry, Shelly, I can\u2019t see it.\nSheldon: Well, whether you see it or not is irrelevant. I can\u2019t see subatomic particles, but nevertheless, they\u2019re there.\nAmy: Excellent point.\nSheldon: A physics point.\nAmy: Touche.\nMrs Cooper: Well, putting aside the pig Latin, it\u2019s a good thing that you two decided to end the relationship so I didn\u2019t have to end it for you.\nSheldon: Amy, after consideration, I believe we may have acted rashly. I propose we resume our relationship and attempt to resolve our differences.\nAmy: I\u2019ll agree to that only if you\u2019ll stipulate that 80% of our difficulties were caused by you.\nSheldon: I\u2019ll go as high as 40.\nAmy: Sixty-five.\nSheldon: Done. You understand that moving forward, we deal with the fact that my mother does not approve of you?\nAmy: I do. I find being cast in the role of bad girl oddly titillating.\nSheldon: Would you like to see my cats?\nAmy: I would. I love cats. They\u2019re the epitome of indifference.\nSheldon: Ah, then you may find Zazzles a little cloying.\nLeonard: I saw what you did there.\nMrs Cooper: He thinks he\u2019s such a smarty pants. He\u2019s no different from any man. You tell \u2019em not to do something, that\u2019s all they want to do. If I hadn\u2019t told my brother Stumpy not to clear out the wood chipper by hand, we\u2019d still be calling him Edward. Now, don\u2019t you move. I\u2019ll bring over all the food.\nLeonard: No, no, no, I can do it.\nMrs Cooper: Well, isn\u2019t that sweet?\nScene: Outside. Sheldon is sitting at a table with a sign reading \u201cCats $20\u201d)\nSheldon: Thank you, Amy. Here\u2019s your cat. And here\u2019s your $20.\nAmy: Next!\nSheldon: Thank you, Amy. Here\u2019s your cat. And here\u2019s your $20.\nAmy: Next!\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "9_17": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The stairwell\nAmy: So Sheldon, there\u2019s something I\u2019ve been wanting to talk about but I know it\u2019s kind of a touchy subject.\nLeonard: Way to narrow it down to everything.\nSheldon: What is it?\nAmy: Well, your birthday\u2019s coming up, and you\u2019ve never let us celebrate it, and I was hoping maybe this year we could.\nSheldon: Oh, I suppose that\u2019s a discussion we could have.\nAmy: Okay, great, I mean, it doesn\u2019t have to be a big party or anything. I was just, where\u2019d he go?\nPenny: W, wait a minute. You mention his birthday and he vanishes?\nLeonard: Well, where\u2019s that information been this whole time?\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The apartment. \nPenny: Well, where is he?\nAmy: Sheldon?\nLeonard: I\u2019ll check his room.\nSheldon: Surprise.\nPenny: Oh, my God.\nSheldon: Just one example of how birthdays can be terrible. Now, can we please drop this subject and pick a new one? I suggest how thick can a soup get before it becomes a stew? You know, the answer, it may surprise you.\nAmy: I\u2019m sorry I brought it up.\nPenny: Yeah, what is the problem? Is it about getting older?\nSheldon: Please, look at this porcelain skin. I\u2019m like a human sink.\nAmy: But it\u2019s the one day a year that\u2019s just all about you.\nLeonard: One day. Right.\nAmy: Can you please just tell me why?\nSheldon: Fine. As you know, I have a twin sister with whom I obviously share a birthday. Every year we\u2019d have a party. No one I invited would ever come, because they didn\u2019t like me.\nAmy: I\u2019m sorry.\nSheldon: Oh, that part wasn\u2019t so bad. I didn\u2019t like them, either. But then I\u2019d inevitably spend the whole day being tortured by my sister\u2019s friends.\nPenny: Oh, poor thing.\nSheldon: When I was six, they told me Batman was coming to my party. I waited by the door for hours. Closest thing to Batman I saw was when a robin flew into the window.\nAmy: You realize none of those things would happen now?\nSheldon: I do, but why do you care if I celebrate my birthday at all?\nAmy: Well, you made my last birthday so memorable, I wanted to return the favour.\nPenny: You know, if you had a party now, you have plenty of friends that would love to come.\nLeonard: And we live here, so we have no choice.\nPenny: Yeah.\nSheldon: Very well. You may celebrate my life by throwing a party with cake, presents and a shower of admiration and love. But then you owe me big-time.\nScene: The comic book store.\nHoward: You have any idea what you\u2019re getting Sheldon for his birthday?\nRaj: He\u2019s been fascinated with dinosaurs lately. Maybe we could get him a fossil.\nLeonard: Well, just don\u2019t get anything Jurassic. He feels like that whole chunk of time has gone Hollywood. Hey, uh, you know, he told a sad story about how his sister tricked him into thinking Batman was coming to his party.\nHoward: That\u2019s funny. Let\u2019s do that.\nLeonard: Maybe we could get Batman to actually show up.\nRaj: You mean, some guy in a lame suit?\nLeonard: Or a real Batman. Hey, Stuart? Didn\u2019t you try to get Adam West to do a signing here once?\nStuart: Yeah, but there was kind of a scheduling conflict. He, uh, wanted to know when he\u2019d get paid. And I wouldn\u2019t tell him.\nLeonard: Can I get his contact info?\nStuart: Sure, uh, but just so you know, he\u2019s kind of a diva.\nLeonard: He is?\nStuart: Oh, yeah. Won\u2019t take the bus. He won\u2019t pack his own lunch. Won\u2019t let you spend the night on his couch.\nScene: The apartment.\nAmy: Okay, so how do you feel about party balloons?\nSheldon: Uh, Mylar balloons, yes. Latex balloons, no. Water balloons, I will jump off the roof and aim for your car.\nPenny: All right, what about music?\nSheldon: I enjoy marching bands and Tibetan throat singing.\nPenny: No music it is.\nBernadette: What kind of cake do you like?\nSheldon: Well, my favourite is chocolate with strawberry frosting, three layers, and if there\u2019s writing on it, make sure it\u2019s not all caps. I don\u2019t need my dessert yelling at me.\nScene: Leonard\u2019s car.\nRaj: Hey, so what was Adam West like on the phone?\nLeonard: Uh, nice guy. But it was a little weird to hear Batman say don\u2019t ring the doorbell or my poodles will go crazy.\nRaj: You know, Adam West is my favourite Batman? Well, after Michael Keaton, Christian Bale and Batman from The Lego Movie.\nHoward: Don\u2019t say that to him.\nRaj: What? He beat out George Clooney, and that\u2019s something. Like, I love me some Clooney.\nLeonard: Don\u2019t say that to anyone.\nScene: The apartment.\nPenny: Thank you so much for helping us, Stuart.\nStuart: Oh, I, I was just glad to be invited. To be honest, I don\u2019t always feel like I\u2019m part of the group.\nPenny: Okay, sweetie, we\u2019re on the clock here. Can you hate yourself and frost at the same time?\nBarry: Hewwo, I hope I\u2019m not too earwy.\nBernadette: No, no, no. Come on in.\nBarry: And how is the wadiant mommy-to-be?\nBernadette: Doing great.\nStuart: You, you\u2019re pregnant?\nBernadette: Yeah.\nStuart: Sounds like something a member of the group might know.\nPenny: Yeah, birthday party first. Pity party later.\nScene: Leonard\u2019s car.\nLeonard: Are you crazy? How can you put Michael Keaton in front of Christian Bale?\nAdam West: Oh, please. Even my poodles know Bale\u2019s overrated.\nRaj: Thank you. That\u2019s why I say Keaton\u2019s number one. He brought a sense of humour to the role.\nAdam: Oh, if you\u2019re gonna factor in a sense of humour, then I should be at the top of the list. It should be me, Keaton, Kilmer, Lego, Bale, and that pretty boy Clooney.\nHoward: Really? You\u2019re ahead of Bale? The man who personified the words, I\u2019m Batman.\nAdam: I never had to say I\u2019m Batman. I showed up, people knew I was Batman. Everywhere I went, on the TV show, mall openings, Julie Newmar\u2019s bungalow.\nLeonard: I\u2019m sold, you\u2019re ahead of Bale.\nAdam: There\u2019s another reason I should be higher on the list. All those other guys had muscles built into their costumes. All I had in my Batsuit was 100%, grade-A West.\nHoward: Can we just all agree we\u2019re worried about Affleck?\nLeonard: Sure.\nRaj: Yeah, of course.\nAdam: What\u2019s an Affleck?\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment.\nSheldon: Is there a reason I had to leave my own apartment?\nAmy: Well, I think they just want you to see it for the first time all decorated.\nSheldon: But who\u2019s gonna tell them they\u2019re doing it wrong?\nAmy: Well, I\u2019m, I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll ask you to give a speech, and that\u2019s when you just tear \u2019em a new one. Have to say, you, you do look good in that suit.\nSheldon: Oh. Thank you.\nAmy: Maybe later I\u2019ll, uh, get to see you in your birthday suit.\nSheldon: But this is my birthday suit. Are you having a stroke? Because that\u2019s the kind of thing that just ruins a birthday party.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: So, Mother, I\u2019m surprised you came all this way for Sheldon\u2019s birthday.\nBeverley: Oh, I was happy to. He did come to my 60th.\nLeonard: Oh. You had a party for your 60th?\nBeverley: Oh, I wouldn\u2019t call it a party. Just a few close friends. And your sister and brother.\nPenny: You know, to be fair, we did get married in Vegas and didn\u2019t invite her.\nBeverley: And I never did thank you for that, dear.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment.\nAmy: Oh. Penny says everyone\u2019s there. Are you ready?\nSheldon: I am. Oh. Wait.\nAmy: Are you all right?\nSheldon: No, I just, I got a little light-headed.\nAmy: Oh, do you need a minute?\nSheldon: No. No, if I can walk past that pet shop with the parrot in the window, I suppose I can do this.\nAll: Happy birthday!\nLeonard: Speech! Speech!\nRaj: Come on, Sheldon, say something.\nSheldon: Uh, um, uh, thank you all so much for coming. Beverly. Wil Wheaton. Adam West, for some reason.\nLeonard: Batman finally came to your party.\nAdam: Happy birthday, Sherman.\nSheldon: Thank you. This is all so thoughtful. Excuse me.\nAdam: I still get paid, don\u2019t I?\nScene: A little later.\nLeonard: Okay, I\u2019d better go in there and talk to him.\nAmy: Well, don\u2019t you think I\u2019m the one who should go in?\nLeonard: No offence, but I\u2019ve known the guy a really long time.\nAmy: Well, I\u2019ve, you know, seen him without pants on.\nLeonard: Again, no offence, but so have I.\nAmy: Well, he\u2019s seen me without pants on.\nLeonard: Again, no\u2026\nPenny: Okay, this is ridiculous. (Knocking) Sheldon? Can I come in?\nSheldon: How do you know I\u2019m not using the facilities?\nPenny: Because you e-mail me your bathroom schedule once a week, even though I\u2019ve clicked unsubscribe, like, a thousand times. So, what\u2019s going on?\nSheldon: I don\u2019t know. I looked around the room, and I saw all the faces and the presents, and it, it was just too much.\nPenny: I get that. Hey, you want to just bring a few people in here? You know, Wil Wheaton in the bathtub, Batman on the toilet. It\u2019ll be like the weirdest Comic-Con ever.\nSheldon: I know that you worked hard to put this together. I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m ruining it.\nPenny: Oh, pl, you\u2019re not ruining it. Look, at some point, Raj will try to get everyone to do the Electric Slide. Now, that will ruin it.\nSheldon: I don\u2019t think I can go back out there.\nPenny: That\u2019s fine. You know, I hate that your sister and her friends used to torture you. But what I hate even more is, if I was there, I would have tortured you, too.\nSheldon: Based on this pep talk, I\u2019d say you\u2019re still doing it.\nPenny: My point is, there was a time I never would\u2019ve been friends with someone like you, and now you are one of my favourite people. So, if what you need is to spend your birthday in a bathroom, I\u2019m happy to do it with you.\nSheldon: Well, everyone will think I\u2019m weird.\nPenny: Sweetie, you are weird. Everyone knows you\u2019re weird, but they\u2019re all still here because they care about you so much.\nBarry (knocking): Hewwo. Some of us need to check our hair because we might have a shot with Weonard\u2019s mother.\nScene: Later. \nLeslie Winkle: Leonard.\nLeonard: Hey.\nLeslie: It\u2019s been a while.\nLeonard: Leslie. I can\u2019t remember the last time we talked. So much has changed.\nLeslie: Has it?\nLeonard: Yeah, uh, um, Penny and I got married.\nLeslie: Wow, congratulations. You know, actually, I thought you\u2019d be living with Sheldon forever.\nLeonard: Yeah, well, don\u2019t be a stranger.\nPenny: Okay, everybody, Sheldon is gonna come back out, but I think he\u2019s a little embarrassed, so let\u2019s all be extra nice, okay?\nBarry: What are you wooking at me for? I\u2019m a saint. But a sinner in the sack.\nSheldon: Hello, everyone. I, I\u2019d like to apologize for my behaviour. I hope it hasn\u2019t put a damper on the party. So, please, enjoy yourselves. Oh, this is quickly getting out of hand.\nAmy: If I may, I, I\u2019d like to propose a toast. Um, thank you all for coming tonight. I know it\u2019s customary for the birthday boy to receive presents, but I feel like I got the greatest gift the day he was born.\nGeneral cheers.\nSheldon: Aw, Amy, that was lovely. You know, this is fun. Let\u2019s do more. Someone else say something wonderful about me.\nHoward: Sheldon, I don\u2019t think everyone\u2026\nSheldon: Wolowitz, perfect. Everyone listen to Wolowitz.\nHoward: Okay, then, uh, Sheldon, we\u2019ve known each other a long time. And it is a pleasure to work with you and call you my friend.\nSheldon: Little generic. Keep thinking. We\u2019ll circle back. Wil Wheaton, go.\nWil: Sheldon, I know that we\u2019ve had our ups and downs, but I can honestly say that my life is so much more interesting because you are in it. We may have met because you are a fan of Star Trek. But I have become a fan of Sheldon Cooper. Live long and prosper, buddy. And happy birthday.\nGeneral cheers.\nSheldon: That\u2019s how you do it, Wolowitz. Now you see why he\u2019s famous and you\u2019re not.\nBeverley: Sheldon, I know the future holds great things for you, and we all can\u2019t wait to see what they are. Happy birthday, dear.\nGeneral cheers.\nBarry: Someone caw Animal Contwol. There\u2019s a cougar on the woose.\nBeverley: Barry, stop.\nLeonard: Seriously, Barry, stop.\nRaj: And it was Gandhi who said, live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever.\nSheldon: And it was Sheldon Cooper who said let\u2019s speed this up. A lot of people want to talk.\nLeslie: Uh, in the past, I would\u2019ve said something obnoxious, like, happy birthday, dumbass. But I\u2019m not gonna do it. You and I have both grown a lot, and it\u2019s just so nice to see you all again. So, happy birthday, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Oh. Oh, now, you know I hate change. Say it.\nLeslie: Happy birthday, dumbass.\nGeneral cheers.\nAdam: Happy birthday, young man. And if any of you have enjoyed seeing me here today, I\u2019m also available for Comic-Cons, bachelor parties, bar mitzvahs\u2026\nBernadette: I can\u2019t think of anything to say that hasn\u2019t already been said, so, here\u2019s to you, Sheldon.\nGeneral cheers.\nSheldon: Thank you, Bernadette. That was perfect.\nHoward: What? You gotta be kidding me?\nLeonard: Sheldon, we\u2019ve been together so long, it\u2019s hard to remember a time you weren\u2019t in my life. And believe me, I try. You make me laugh. You make me a better scientist. You make me crazy. You\u2019re more than just my roommate, you\u2019re my brother.\nSheldon: Thank you.\nLeonard: Happy birthday, buddy.\nGeneral cheers.\nSheldon: Thank you. That, that was wonderful.\nPenny: Oh, wait, wait, wait. Stuart didn\u2019t get to speak.\nStuart: Oh, oh, okay. Um, uh, Sheldon, I\u2019ve spent most of my life feeling invisible, but having you and everyone\u2026\nAmy: Hey, everybody, listen up.\nPenny: You nailed it.\nAmy: We\u2019ve got someone who couldn\u2019t be here but really wanted to wish you a happy birthday.\nStephen Hawking (on Skype): Hello, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Professor Hawking.\nStephen: Happy birthday to you.\nSheldon: Thank you so much. I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re\u2026\nStephen: Happy birthday to you.\nSheldon: Oh, you\u2019re singing. Well, I\u2019m sorry.\nStephen: Happy birthday, dear Sheldon.\nLeonard: Uh, Professor Hawking, if you just give us one second, we\u2019ll light the candles, and we can all sing together.\nStephen: I was crushing it, but all right.\nPenny: Okay, while they get the cake, Sheldon, I just want to say, I hope you didn\u2019t think you were gonna get through tonight without a hug.\nSheldon: You know, I used to hate these hugs. Now they\u2019re just extremely irritating.\nLeonard: Ready when you are, Professor Hawking.\nStephen: And a one, and a two\u2026\nAll: Happy birthday to you,\nHappy birthday to you,\nHappy birthday, dear Sheldon,\nHappy birthday to you.\nGeneral cheers.\nAdam: So, who\u2019s taking me home?\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "8_7": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: Penny\u2019s apartment.\nBernadette: So, what are you working on these days?\nAmy: I\u2019m studying one-celled organisms to try and find the neurochemicals that lead to the feeling of shame.\nBernadette: What would a one-celled organism have to be embarrassed about?\nPenny: Same as all of us, getting out of a car without underwear.\nBermadette: Speaking of underwear, I have some interesting news.\nPenny: Okay, if it\u2019s sometimes Howie wears yours, Leonard already told us.\nBernadette: He was being funny. I\u2019m pretty sure. Anyway, I was asked to be a part of a magazine article about the 50 sexiest female scientists in California. Isn\u2019t that cool?\nAmy: I think it\u2019s awful.\nPenny: Why would you say that?\nAmy: Bernadette is a successful microbiologist. She should be celebrated for her achievements, not her looks. I mean, what kind of message does that send?\nPenny: I think the message is check out the rack on that scientist.\nBernadette: Why can\u2019t someone be thought of as both smart and pretty?\nAmy: I just don\u2019t think a professional woman should have to flaunt her sexuality in order to get ahead.\nPenny: Okay, what\u2019s the big deal? Look, if it helps me make a sale with a physician, I don\u2019t think it hurts to flirt a little. I mean, laugh at their joke, touch their arm, maybe crank up the AC in the car beforehand, you know, to wake up the girls.\nAmy: Maybe it\u2019s different in the world of sales, but it\u2019s already hard enough for women to be taken seriously in science.\nBernadette: I was kind of excited about the article, but now you\u2019re making me feel bad.\nPenny: No, I think you should do whatever you want. You know, maybe if fashion magazines had female scientists in them, I would\u2019ve become a theoretical physicist. Stop smirking at each other.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The building foyer. \nMan with Flowers: Thank you.\nSheldon: No, thank you. Delivery men are the unsung foot soldiers of our nation\u2019s commerce. It\u2019s because of people like you, people like me can limit our human contact. I\u2019d shake your hand, but, well, you know.\nMan: I\u2019m not a delivery man, I\u2019m a doctor. Although I do often deliver alarming biopsy results to my patients.\nSheldon: That\u2019s humorous.\nMan: All right.\nSheldon: Yeah, I bet you leave your patients in stitches. That was also humorous.\nMan: All right.\nSheldon: Are you bringing flowers to a patient to cushion the blow of a terminal diagnosis? That wasn\u2019t a joke.\nMan: All right. These are actually for a nice woman who makes sales calls to my office.\nSheldon: Hmm. You know, they have delivery people that will do that for you.\nMan: I was hoping to impress her by tracking her down on the Internet and then showing up unannounced at her door.\nSheldon: Making the extra effort. Good for you.\nLeonard: Great timing, food just got here.\nSheldon: Ooh, Siam Palace?\nLeonard: Yes.\nSheldon: Uh, mee krob and chicken satay?\nLeonard: Yes.\nSheldon: Uh, extra peanut sauce?\nLeonard: No, but you can have mine.\nSheldon: Eh, well, very well. Oh, and on the topic of sharing things that are yours, there is a gentleman caller bringing flowers to your fianc\u00e9e as we speak.\nLeonard: What? Why didn\u2019t you say that first?\nSheldon: Why didn\u2019t you get extra peanut sauce? We can both play this game.\nLeonard: Can I help you?\nMan: Oh, hi. Uh, does Penny live here?\nLeonard: May I ask why?\nMan: Well, uh, I met her at my office, she winked at me. And, uh, I came hoping to initiate a romantic relationship.\nLeonard: Okay, um, look, I\u2019m pretty sure she didn\u2019t wink at you.\nMan: Oh, she did. Seductively, like this. And then she touched my arm for two Mississippis. Like, you know, one Mississippi, two\u2026\nLeonard: I got it, I got it. Listen, um, I think there\u2019s been a misunderstanding. See, Penny is my fianc\u00e9e.\nMan: Really? I\u2019ve never seen her wear an engagement ring.\nRaj: Really?\nMan: So, am I to presume that her flirtation was just a sales technique?\nLeonard: I think so.\nMan: When will I learn? It\u2019s just like the cute girl at the pet store all over again.\nLeonard: Excuse me?\nMan: Oh, uh, she touched my arm for five Mississippis, and I bought a two thousand dollar iguana habitat. Which she was always too busy to come over and see. You give these to Penny. You\u2019re a, you\u2019re a lucky man.\nLeonard: Thank you. Sorry.\nMan: Oh, uh, you probably don\u2019t want her to see this. It\u2019s unnecessarily graphic.\nSheldon: Hold on, Doctor. Leonard, where are your social skills? This man is clearly upset. We should invite him in for a hot beverage.\nLeonard: He tried to score with Penny.\nSheldon: So have these two, and they\u2019re having dinner with us.\nScene: A bar.\nAmy: So, how was work today?\nBernadette: It was fine, but you\u2019ll be happy to know they pulled the sexy scientists article.\nAmy: What happened?\nBernadette: I don\u2019t know. They just canceled the photo shoot and said they\u2019re rethinking it.\nAmy: Well, I\u2019m really sorry, but I think it\u2019s for the best. You want people focusing on your achievements, not staring at your breasts in some magazine.\nBernadette: I guess. It\u2019s really not that important. Hey, up here.\nAmy: Sorry, it\u2019s just we\u2019re, we were talking about them. So, look, I, I wasn\u2019t going to say anything, but since you seem to be okay with the article being canceled, I have a little confession. I\u2019m the reason it was pulled.\nBernadette: What? How?\nAmy: I sent the editors of the magazine a pretty scathing e-mail.\nBernadette: Amy, what did you say?\nAmy: I simply pointed out that they would never consider doing an article ranking male scientists on their sexuality, let alone showing them in various stages of undress.\nBernadette: Because no one wants to see Neil deGrasse Tyson in a wet T-shirt, bent over the hood of a Porsche.\nAmy: Well, it doesn\u2019t make a difference, because they agreed it was in bad taste, and now you agree, so Amy saves the day.\nBernadette: No, what happened was you got jealous, so you took away a chance for me to get some publicity.\nAmy: But it was bad publicity.\nBernadette: That\u2019s for me to decide, not you.\nAmy: I disagree. As a female scientist, I think what you do affects all of us.\nBernadette: And I think you don\u2019t like people expressing their sexuality because no one wants you to express yours. Oh, Amy, I\u2019m so sorry. That was over the line.\nAmy: You have a nice night.\nBernadette: Please don\u2019t go. Up until my vicious attack, you were the one in the wrong.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Here you go, Doctor. Red Zinger with one teaspoon of honey.\nMan: Thank you. Neat Star Trek mug. I actually have one of the phasers from the original TV show.\nRaj: Oh, cool.\nHoward: How\u2019d you get that?\nMan: Oh, easy, Gene Roddenberry needed a vasectomy.\nSehldon: Wait a minute. You\u2019ve snipped Gene Roddenberry\u2019s vas deferens?\nMan: Yes.\nHoward: Wow, he really went where no man has gone before.\nMan: I don\u2019t like to brag,but, uh, you see, I\u2019m kind of the doctor to the stars\u2019 urinary tracts.\nAll: Wow.\nMan: Uh, you, you want to see James Cameron\u2019s kidney stone?\nAll: Ooh.\nMan: He was so happy after he passed it, he gave me a Terminator.\nLeonard: That is amazing. How long have you been collecting?\nMan: Ever since I was a kid, but, uh, I didn\u2019t really get serious until William Shatner\u2019s bladder infection.\nSheldon: What\u2019d you get? What\u2019d you get?\nMan: Well, he said it was a tribble. It could be a toupee, but either way, it\u2019s pretty cool.\nRaj: I would love to see your collection.\nMan: Anytime. Uh, I\u2019ve got some cool stuff. When I first started, I thought it would be a good way to meet women, but, well, you know.\nHoward: We know.\nRaj: Preach.\nMan: Can I ask you a personal question?\nLeonard: Sure.\nMan: Um, I mean, you\u2019re a guy like me, so how\u2019d you get a girl like Penny?\nLeonard: Oh. Well, you know, just being myself, really.\nSheldon: Oh, please, you know, I\u2019ll tell you how he did it. Implacable, relentless badgering. In urology terms, he was a drug-resistant staph infection. And she was a urethra that could not shake him.\nLeonard: I don\u2019t know that I\u2019d call myself an infection.\nHoward: A gallant man would defend his fianc\u00e9e for being called a urethra.\nLeonard: Can we please change the subject?\nPenny: Hi.\nRaj: Well, that didn\u2019t go your way.\nPenny: Dr. Lorvis, what are you doing here?\nDr Lorvis: Uh, well, actually I came to see you.\nPenny: Really? Why?\nLeonard: Ah, that\u2019s a good question. Apparently someone was being awfully flirty while not wearing their engagement ring, causing another someone to show up here thinking the first someone might be available.\nSheldon: Oh, God. Don\u2019t make it so hard on her. Look, the first someone is the deceitful you. The second someone is the delightful Dr. Lorvis.\nPenny: Oh, this is very embarrassing. Dr. Lorvis, I am so sorry. I did not mean to lead you on.\nDr Lorvis: You touched my arm for two Mississippis.\nPenny: Oh. That\u2019s why you were mumbling Mississippi.\nLeonard: Can we talk in private?\nPenny: Please, yes.\nLeonard: I\u2019ll be right back.\nSheldon: So what other celebrity genitalia have you handled?\nLeonard: So, uh, what\u2019s the deal? You take off your ring when you go to work?\nPenny: What? No, no, I just put it on the other hand and turn it around. Keep that hand in my pocket.\nLeonard: Why?\nPenny: Well, what do you mean why? Look, I make more sales if these doctors think I\u2019m single. I did the same kind of thing as a waitress. The real question is, what is he doing in your apartment?\nLeonard: Oh, he was upset. So Sheldon invited him in for a hot beverage.\nPenny: You were okay with that?\nLeonard: No. I got upset. And Sheldon made me a beverage, too.\nPenny: Okay, he just showed up at my door. Don\u2019t you think that\u2019s a little weird?\nLeonard: A little, but he\u2019s basically harmless. He\u2019s actually kind of a nice guy.\nPenny: Okay. Whatever, look, my company does not allow me to socialize with doctors outside of work. You got to get rid of him.\nLeonard: Why am I the one that has to get rid of him?\nPenny: I can\u2019t do it, he\u2019s my best client.\nLeonard: All right, I\u2019ll get rid of him. But you owe me one.\nRaj: Hey, we\u2019re going to Oliver\u2019s house to see his collection. You want to go with us?\nLeonard: Yeah, sure. You owe me.\nScene: Dr Lorvis\u2019 basement.\nLeonard: Oh, my God.\nSheldon: Leonard, I was wrong. Heaven does exist. And it\u2019s in the basement of a urologist\u2019s house in Sherman Oaks.\nDr Lorvis: Welcome to my Fortress of Solitude. This is where I go to get away from all my other solitude.\nHoward: Oh, come on. It\u2019s a replica.\nDr Lorvis: Original.\nHoward: Oh, I think I just cheated on my wife.\nRaj: The gun from Hellboy?\nDr Lorvis: Yup.\nRaj: How did you get it?\nDr Lorvis: Bought it at auction.\nRaj: Oh, I was hoping for a juicy tidbit about Ron Perlman\u2019s testicles.\nWoman\u2019s voice (off): Oliver, I\u2019m going to play bingo.\nDr Lorvis: Okay, Mother. Have fun.\nHoward: Still lives with his ma. Yikes, right?\nRaj: Yeah, I\u2019m not quite sure how to respond.\nLeonard: Wow, Donkey Kong. This, this was my game when I was a kid.\nSheldon: Because it\u2019s a story of a pretty blonde girl tirelessly pursued by a small, oddly-shaped man?\nLeonard: No, because I liked it.\nSheldon: Well, now, don\u2019t get defensive. You\u2019re oddly-shaped, but you got the girl.\nDr Lorvis: So, I\u2019ve noticed Leonard gets teased a lot 0about his relationship with Penny.\nSheldon: Yes. If you\u2019d like to join in, the premise is their love seems unlikely and doomed to failure.\nDr Lorvis: So, you think she\u2019ll be single soon?\nSheldon: Oh, if you want to get in on the pool, you\u2019re too late. All the squares have been purchased.\nDr Lorvis: Interesting. Excuse me, I have to take care of something.\nSheldon: Leonard, as your friend I feel I should tell you something.\nLeonard: What?\nSheldon: I\u2019m still upset about that peanut sauce.\nScene: The lobby.\nDr Lorvis: Oh, could you hold the door?\nAmy: Nice flowers.\nDr Lorvis: Thank you. They\u2019re for a girl. Uh, I\u2019m being implacable and relentless.\nAmy: Isn\u2019t she lucky?\nDr Lorvis: She keeps sending me mixed signals. But I think we both want the same thing.\nAmy: What\u2019s that?\nDr Lorvis: Unconditional love.\nAmy: I guess that\u2019s all anybody wants.\nDr Lorvis: I guess so.\nAmy: Well, I hope you get it.\nDr Lorvis: One Mississippi, two Mississippi.\nScene: Dr Lorvis\u2019 basement.\nLeonard: Next game, let\u2019s switch helmets.\nSheldon: No, I\u2019d look silly in that helmet.\nScene: The stairwell. \nAmy: I can\u2019t take these.\nDr Lorvis: Why not? I mean, you want what I want. And we had two wonderful Mississippis.\nAmy: But what about the other girl?\nDr Lorvis: Oh, right. I\u2019ll tell her we should just be friends.\nPenny: Dr. Lorvis?\nDr Lorvis: Penny, we should just be friends. Happy?\nScene: Dr Lorvis\u2019 basement.\nRaj: You think he bites?\nHoward: Stick your head in there and find out.\nRaj: You fooled me with that goat at the petting zoo. You will not fool me again.\nLeonard: I wonder where Dr. Lorvis is. He\u2019s been gone a while.\nRaj: Maybe he\u2019s playing bingo with his mommy.\nHoward: It\u2019s sad how some guys can\u2019t cut the apron strings.\nRaj: Okay, now you\u2019re messing with me.\nLeonard: Uh, guys, we\u2019re locked in here.\nSheldon: Oh, this day just keeps getting better.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment.\nPenny: So, you just left them alone playing games in your house?\nDr Lorvis: Well, they seemed happy and I thought that would give me time for you and I to get to know each other better. That was before we met.\nAmy: We all have a past.\nPenny: Doc, you\u2019ve got to see what you\u2019re doing is, is a little creepy.\nDr Lorvis: You sound just like Sigourney Weaver when I followed her into a restroom.\nPenny: Okay, you can\u2019t just go chasing after every girl who\u2019s nice to you.\nDr Lorvis: Well, that\u2019s not what Sheldon says. And he seems to know his way around the ladies.\nPenny (on phone): Hey, Leonard. Guess who\u2019s back. Dr. Lorvis. Yeah. You care to join us? What? You locked them in your basement?\nDr Lorvis: Well, they\u2019re, they\u2019re not locked in. The door just sticks.\nPenny: Okay, so how do they unstick it?\nDr Lorvis: They\u2019d need the key.\nPenny: Okay. Nope. That\u2019s it. We are gonna go over there right now, and you are going to let them out.\nDr Lorvis: Three Mississippi, four Mississippi.\nPenny: Move it.\nScene: The foyer. \nBernadette: Oh, good, you\u2019re here. Amy, I am so sorry.\nAmy: That has to wait. This weirdo locked the guys up in his basement.\nBernadette: What?\nDr Lorvis: She seems nice. Who\u2019s she?\nPenny: Just walk.\nScene: Dr Lorvis\u2019 basement. \nSheldon: You can do this.\nRaj: One ladder left.\nLeonard: Oh-hom yeah.\nHoward: Yes.\nLeonard: Next level.\nPenny: Leonard, are you okay?\nLeonard: Better than okay. I am having the game of my life.\nAmy: Dr. Lorvis, isn\u2019t there something you want to say?\nDr Lorvis: Yes. I\u2019m very sorry for locking you in my home.\nHoward: Yeah, that was very uncool. Get the hammer. Get the hammer.\nLeonard: Got it.\nPenny: Okay, Leonard, let\u2019s go.\nLeonard: Just hang on.\nDr Lorvis: Well, while we wait, would you like to see Tobey Maguire\u2019s prostate sonogram?\nAmy: Sure.\nPenny: Yeah.\nDr Lorvis: Oh, spoiler alert. He was worried about nothing.\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "6_2": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: Bernadette\u2019s apartment.\nBernadette: And the next wedding gift is a gravy boat.\nPenny: Ooh, one gravy boat.\nAmy: That\u2019s from Sheldon. He told me he had it engraved.\nBernadette: In the event of a divorce, please return to Sheldon Cooper.\nPenny: One inappropriate, yet I wish I thought of that gravy boat.\nAmy: When I get married I\u2019m going to register at the UCLA Cadaver Lab.\nPenny: Ew, why?\nAmy: \u2018Cause I\u2019ve always wanted a whole human skeleton and they are really spendy.\nBernadette: So, you actually see you and Sheldon getting married someday?\nAmy: Not just someday. In exactly four years. But don\u2019t tell Sheldon. He\u2019s still a flight risk.\nBernadette: What about you, Penny?\nPenny: What about me what?\nBernadette: Do you think you and Leonard might ever get married?\nPenny: Oh, well, you know, Leonard is great.\nBernadette: But do you think you\u2019ll ever get married?\nPenny: He\u2019s a sweetie.\nAmy: You\u2019re not answering the question. Do you love him?\nPenny: Yeah, sure, of course I love him.\nBernadette: It doesn\u2019t sound like it.\nPenny: Well, I do.\nBernadette: Do you tell him that?\nPenny: No, he\u2019d just take it the wrong way.\nAmy: What does that mean?\nPenny: It means he is special and smart and nice and\u2026\nBernadette: Are you gonna break up with him?\nPenny: No. Maybe. I don\u2019t know.\nBernadette: I had no idea you were unhappy.\nPenny: That\u2019s the thing, I\u2019m not. I\u2019m not unhappy at all. It\u2019s just, I don\u2019t know, I, I\u2019ve been in love before, but it felt different. But maybe this is a new, better, boring kind of love. Do you ever feel that way about Howard?\nBernadette: Oh, that\u2019s not really a fair comparison. I\u2019m basically married to a sexy Buzz Lightyear.\nPenny: Amy, you?\nAmy: Can\u2019t help ya, kid. Whenever I\u2019m around Sheldon, I feel like my loins are on fire. In the good way. Not the urinary tract infection way.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: Cutting between the International Space Station and the apartment (the guys are on webcam).\nRaj (voice off): Hey, buddy, how\u2019s it going up there?\nHoward: You don\u2019t have to shout, Raj. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m an astronaut floating around in outer space. Oh, wait, I am.\nLeonard: So, is it everything you hoped it would be?\nHoward: It\u2019s better. I wake up every morning and I just can\u2019t believe I\u2019m on this incredible adventure.\nDimitri: Hey, Froot Loops, did you clean the space toilet?\nHoward: Excuse me. I\u2019m talking to my friends.\nMike: You know the rules, new guy scrubs the toilet.\nDimitri: If you do good job, next time we give you brush.\nHoward: Funny. We\u2019re always giving each other a hard time up here. It\u2019s kind of like being in a frat. You know, joking, kidding around, hurting feelings.\nSheldon: Okay, my turn. Let me talk to him.\nLeonard: Go ahead.\nSheldon: 2311 North Los Robles Avenue, Pasadena, California to International Space Station. Can you read me? Over. (Makes static noise)\nHoward: Yes, I read you, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Copy that. Over. (Static noise)\nLeonard: What are you doing?\nSheldon: I am talking to a man in space. If you don\u2019t have the (static noise) then he might as well be at the Coffee Bean over on Lake Street.\nHoward: You\u2019re out of your mind,Sheldon.\nSheldon: That\u2019s a negative. My mother had me tested. Over. (Static noise)\nMike: Come on, scrub it up, Loops.\nHoward: All right, all right. I gotta go. There\u2019s a meteor shower.\nMike: You want to see a meteor shower? Take a look at what Dimitri just left you in the toilet.\nHoward: Bye.\nSheldon: Over and out. (Static noise)\nRaj: Bye, buddy!\nStuart (knocking and entering): Hello.\nRaj: Hey, Stuart, come on in.\nSheldon: What are you doing here?\nStuart: Um, Raj invited me to go to the movies with you guys.\nSheldon: Excuse me. I didn\u2019t authorize this.\nLeonard: Sheldon, you are not in charge.\nSheldon: That\u2019s mighty sassy for a man with a roommate performance review around the corner.\nRaj: What\u2019s the big deal? You guys are bringing your girlfriends. I didn\u2019t want to sit by myself.\nSheldon: The big deal is I was expecting us to be an intimate group of five. Now, we\u2019re going to be a faceless mass of six.\nLeonard: It\u2019ll be fine. Just, uh, pretend he\u2019s Wolowitz.\nSheldon: Hmm. Do you like Raisinets?\nStuart: I can take them or leave them.\nSheldon: At the movies, Wolowitz always eats Raisinets.\nStuart: Would you feel more comfortable if I ate Raisinets?\nSheldon: Well, it\u2019s hardly my business what you eat, as long as it doesn\u2019t crunch during the film and it\u2019s Raisinets.\nStuart: Okay. Should we go?\nSheldon: Yuh-uh, one more question, if you\u2019re going to replace Wolowitz, I need to know a little more about you.\nStuart: All right.\nSheldon: Wolowitz went to MIT. What\u2019s your educational background?\nStuart: I went to art school.\nSheldon: Equally ridiculous. Let\u2019s go.\nScene: The cinema.\nSheldon: This insistence on hand-holding is preposterous.\nAmy: Well, I like it.\nSheldon: Yeah, of course you do. You\u2019re a girl. You like all kinds of hippy-dippy things.\nAmy: Just watch the movie.\nSheldon: It\u2019s not fair. Penny isn\u2019t making Leonard hold hands.\nAmy: There might be a reason for that.\nSheldon: Sweaty? Unhygienic? Looks dumb? Take your pick.\nAmy: Penny said she\u2019s not sure she wants to be Leonard\u2019s girlfriend anymore.\nSheldon: Wrong. She just took a sip from his Diet Dr. Pepper.\nAmy: So?\nSheldon: So, if she wants to end her pair-bond with Leonard, why on earth would she guzzle a witches\u2019 brew of his soda and spit?\nAmy: It\u2019s complicated.\nSheldon: String theory is complicated. That\u2019s just yucky. Don\u2019t get any ideas. All right, for the sake of argument, let\u2019s say that\u2019s true. Why doesn\u2019t Penny just end the relationship?\nAmy: She\u2019s not sure how she feels.\nSheldon: How can she not be sure how she feels? You know, when I have a feeling, I know it. Trains? Love them. Swordfish? I love them, too. They\u2019re fish with a sword for a nose.\nAmy: Regardless, don\u2019t say anything to Leonard.\nSheldon: Now you\u2019re asking me to keep a secret from my best friend, colleague, and roommate?\nAmy: Yes, please, Penny will kill me.\nSheldon: Uh, fine. FYI, secret-keeping? Hate it. Hand-holding? Not a fan. Hammerhead shark? I love that thing. Yeah, it\u2019s another fish with a tool on its head.\nStuart: Raisinet?\nSheldon: Shh, we\u2019re trying to watch the movie. This is not working out with him.\nScene: The apartment. Sheldon is making a sucking noise with his teeth.\nLeonard: What are you doing?\nSheldon: I think I might have tartar buildup. My tongue won\u2019t go as far forward as it used to.\nLeonard: Maybe your tongue is shrinking.\nSheldon (measures): Nope. Oh, you have no idea how annoying this is.\nLeonard: I\u2019m starting to get a sense of it. Don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll take you to the dentist tomorrow.\nSheldon: Thank you. I appreciate that. You\u2019re good people, Leonard. There\u2019s something I need to tell you.\nLeonard: Okay.\nSheldon: I can\u2019t tell you.\nLeonard: Why?\nSheldon: I can\u2019t tell you why I can\u2019t tell you. So I guess there\u2019s two things I can\u2019t tell you.\nLeonard: I wish there were more.\nSheldon: Good night. I\u2019m sorry. This is really important.\nLeonard: What is it?\nSheldon: I like The Transformers. Do you like The Transformers?\nLeonard: Where exactly did your mother have you tested?\nSheldon: Leonard, the Transformers teach us that things are not always what they appear to be. You know, like, uh, a semi truck might be an alien robot, or, uh, someone in a romantic relationship, uh, might feel differently than they appear to. Or a conversation about The Transformers might actually be about someone in this room. I\u2019m going to pause to let that sink in.\nLeonard: Okay, I think I understand.\nSheldon: You do?\nLeonard: The guy who seems like an emotionless robot is you, but your relationship with Amy is causing you to transform into a red-blooded man with sexual desires.\nSheldon: That is literally the stupidest thing I\u2019ve ever heard.\nScene: Leonard\u2019s room.\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard? (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard? (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard?\nLeonard: What?\nSheldon: Are you sleeping?\nLeonard: I was. Now I\u2019m having a nightmare. What do you want?\nSheldon: Never mind. I still can\u2019t tell you.\nScene: Penny\u2019s bedroom. Sheldon is standing over Penny\u2019s bed, knocking on the wall.\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Penny? (Knock, knock, knock) Penny? (Knock, knock, knock) Penny? (Penny wakes up and screams. Sheldon also screams)\nPenny: Oh, my God. Sheldon?\nSheldon: You frightened me.\nPenny: What are you doing in my bedroom?\nSheldon: Yeah, well, I knocked on the front door, but you didn\u2019t hear it.\nPenny: How did you even get in, you weirdo?\nSheldon: Yeah, really? I\u2019ve seen strange men traipsing in and out of here for years, but when I do it, it\u2019s weird?\nPenny: What do you want, Sheldon?\nSheldon: Oh, I was having a little trouble sleeping and I just thought, uh, seeing as you\u2019re up, we could talk.\nPenny: Talk about what?\nSheldon: Oh, I don\u2019t know, uh, weather, uh, fish you could do carpentry with, why Leonard is such an attractive and desirable boyfriend. Yeah, pick one, your choice.\nPenny: Sheldon.\nSheldon: Did you know that Leonard has a perfect driving record and enjoys the insurance discounts that go along with that? Hubba-hubba.\nPenny: Okay, go home, crazy man.\nSheldon: Yeah. Did you know that while Leonard is not considered a tall fellow in our country, in today\u2019s North Korea, he\u2019s downright average. Hey, talk about a keeper.\nPenny: Okay, what did Amy tell you?\nSheldon: Oh, very well. I can\u2019t keep up this clever charade any longer. She told me that you were thinking of ending it with Leonard.\nPenny: Okay, you listen to me. I think it\u2019s really sweet you\u2019re trying to protect your friend, but this is none of your business. Got it?\nSheldon: Excuse me. This is not about protecting my friend. I\u2019m a big fan of homeostasis. Do you know what that is?\nPenny: Of course not.\nSheldon: Homeostasis refers to a system\u2019s ability to regulate its internal environment and maintain a constant condition of properties like temperature or pH.\nPenny: Worst bedtime story ever.\nSheldon: My point is I don\u2019t like when things change. So, regardless of your feelings, I would like you to continue dating Leonard. And also, while we\u2019re on the subject, you recently changed your shampoo. I\u2019m not comfortable with the new scent. Please stop this madness and go back to green apple.\nPenny: Okay, honey, I have a lot to figure out, and until I do, you are not to say a word to Leonard. Do you understand?\nSheldon: I do. You clear on the shampoo issue?\nPenny: Get out.\nSheldon: Penny?\nPenny: What?\nSheldon: Please don\u2019t hurt my friend.\nPenny: That is the last thing I want to do.\nSheldon: Thank you. Coconut? What were you thinking? Are you a hula girl?\nPenny: Get out.\nScene: Amy\u2019s bedroom. Phone rings.\nAmy: Hello?\nPenny: What the hell is wrong with you? You told Sheldon? Do you know what a terrible position this puts me in? (Phone beeps)\nAmy: Hang on, please. Hello?\nSheldon: Yeah, just a heads-up: Penny knows that you blabbed about Leonard. She\u2019s pretty mad.\nAmy: I know. She\u2019s yelling at me right now.\nSheldon: All right then, so we\u2019re all on the same page. Yes.\nScene: Cutting between the International Space Station and the Bernadette\u2019s apartment.\nHoward: Hey, Bernie.\nBernadette: There\u2019s my hubby. How\u2019s everything going up there?\nHoward: Oh, it\u2019s okay. Space is beautiful. Earth is beautiful. Same old, same old.\nBernadette: What\u2019s wrong?\nHoward: Nothing. Everything\u2019s fine.\nBernadette: Howard.\nHoward: The other astronauts are being mean to me.\nBernadette: No, what are they doing?\nHoward: Well, like for instance, the other day when I was asleep, one of the guys went on a space walk and glued a big-eyed rubber alien mask to the outside of my window. When I woke up, I screamed for like nine minutes.\nBernadette: Oh, Howie.\nHoward: You can see it if you want. It\u2019s on YouTube. Google astronaut screams for nine minutes.\nBernadette: Why don\u2019t you stand up to them?\nHoward: What am I supposed to say?\nBernadette: I don\u2019t know. Say, being mean is lame, what\u2019s cool is being nice.\nHoward: Great, I\u2019ll do that when I want to be the first guy in space to get a wedgie.\nBernadette: Do you want me to call somebody at NASA?\nHoward: No. My mom already tried that. It only made things worse.\nScene: The apartment. The guys are playing a card game.\nLeonard: Gelatinous Sphere.\nRaj: Focused Locust.\nStuart: Temple of Yip.\nSheldon: I\u2019m sorry. Wolowitz would never play that card.\nStuart: All right, Lesser Demon Turtle.\nSheldon: Fairy God Monster, I win. Your desperate need for friendship makes you weak.\nRaj: So, what are you guys doing later? Stuart and I were thinking of going out for a drink.\nStuart: We\u2019re gonna try to meet some girls.\nRaj: \u2018Cause that\u2019s what we do.\nStuart: Watch out, ladies, a little coffee and cream coming your way.\nRaj: In case you didn\u2019t follow that, I\u2019m the coffee.\nSheldon: Leonard? Maybe you\u2019d like to go with them to meet girls.\nLeonard: Why would I be interested? I have Penny.\nSheldon: Yeah, for now. But that woman has a death wish, Leonard. She talks to strangers, she pets unfamiliar dogs, and it is ridiculously easy to break into her apartment. If I were you, I\u2019d get a back-up.\nLeonard: You can\u2019t just replace someone you care about with some other random person.\nStuart: No, please don\u2019t ruin this for me.\nSheldon: Do you remember how upset I was when they replaced Edward Norton as the Hulk?\nLeonard: Yes, you walked around for a week saying, Sheldon unhappy with casting choice.\nSheldon: But, then Mark Ruffalo was the Hulk in The Avengers, and he was even better.\nLeonard: What\u2019s your point?\nSheldon: Call me a romantic. I like to think that your Mark Ruffalo is still out there somewhere.\nLeonard: This is ridiculous. Are we gonna play cards or not?\nStuart: I like Mark Ruffalo, too.\nSheldon: Yeah, settle down there, fake Wolowitz. No one likes a kiss-up.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment.\nLeonard: So, I had to take Sheldon to the dentist this morning.\nPenny: Really?\nLeonard: Yup. I told him if he didn\u2019t bite the hygienist, I\u2019d take him for ice cream.\nPenny: Mmm.\nLeonard: I didn\u2019t have to take him for ice cream.\nPenny: Uh-huh.\nLeonard: You okay? You seem a little distracted.\nPenny: Look, there\u2019s something I need to tell you.\nLeonard: Oh. Yeah, okay.\nPenny: I don\u2019t really know how to say this.\nLeonard: Just say it.\nPenny: Okay. Here goes.\nLeonard: Mm-hmm.\nScene: Bernadette\u2019s apartment.\nAmy: You slept with him?\nPenny: I didn\u2019t know what else to do. He had those big, sad eyes.\nBernadette: Oh, sure, you had no choice.\nPenny: He looked at me like this.\nAmy: Well, if that\u2019s all it takes, it\u2019s a good thing you don\u2019t have a dog.\nBernadette: Don\u2019t worry. You\u2019ll have plenty of chances to break up with him. Your wedding day, your honeymoon, your 50th anniversary.\nPenny: Look, it\u2019s fine. We\u2019re not getting married, okay? We\u2019re keeping things, you know, homeostasis.\nAmy: It\u2019s so cute when she tries.\nPenny (phone text tone): It\u2019s from Leonard. Last night was amazing. You\u2019re amazing. I\u2019m so lucky to have you in my life. (They give him a hangdog look) Okay, stop it.\nScene: Cutting between the International Space Station and the Bernadette\u2019s apartment.\nHoward: Hey, Bernie, guess what? I stood up to the other astronauts like you said and I got to tell you, last night was the first time in a week I got a good night\u2019s sleep. (On screen, Howard has a mouse face drawn on his face, and the words F.LOOPS on his forehead.)\nBernadette: Oh, Howie.\nHoward: What\u2019s wrong? You look upset.\nBernadette: Nope, this is my proud face.\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "9_23": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The apartment.\nPenny: Helium.\nSheldon: Yes.\nPenny: Yes.\nSheldon: Taylor Swift.\nPenny: Yes. Pi.\nSheldon: Yes. Kardashian.\nPenny: More specific.\nSheldon: Khloe?\nPenny: Yes.\nSheldon: See, I remembered because if it looks like Kim it\u2019s Kim, if it looks kind of like Kim it\u2019s Kourtney, and if it looks nothing like Kim it\u2019s Khloe.\nPenny: Oh, that\u2019s a Venn Diagram, and I remember because I thought to myself, venn is he gonna stop talking about this diagram?\nLeonard: What are you guys doing?\nSheldon: Oh, well, we decided to use our breakfast time to expand our respective knowledge bases.\nLeonard: Oh, let me try.\nPenny: Okay.\nLeonard: Hmm, atom of hydrogen, Adam of Maroon 5, mic drop.\nSheldon: I\u2019m sorry, who is Mike Drop?\nLeonard: Oh, hey, Penny, do you want to go to the airport with me later to pick up my mother?\nPenny: Sure.\nLeonard: Thanks.\nPenny: No problem.\nLeonard: Hey, Penny, um, since you\u2019re already gonna be at the airport, do I need to go?\nSheldon: Why don\u2019t you want to get your mother from the airport?\nLeonard: Well, I can do without the 40-minute car ride where she criticizes every aspect of my life.\nSheldon: She can cover it in a car ride? I could do 40 minutes on your posture alone.\nPenny: You really want me to pick up your mother all by myself?\nLeonard: Hmm, I just feel like it would be a good chance for you to bond.\nPenny: Or a way for you to avoid her?\nLeonard: I don\u2019t know what he\u2019s putting on those cards, but you are smarter than ever.\nPenny: Fine, if you really want me to, I will pick your mom up.\nLeonard: Seriously?\nPenny: Yeah, you know what, she is my mother-in-law, and I\u2019d like for us to have a good relationship.\nLeonard: That is very mature of you, so I\u2019m gonna go ahead and say, suckah.\nSheldon: All right, back to learning.\nPenny: Okay.\nSheldon: Oh, easy, Bill Nye the Science Guy.\nPenny: Or as I know him?\nSheldon: Creepy old dude from Dancing with the Stars.\nPenny: Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The comic book store.\nRaj: Did you guys see there\u2019s an Avengers screening? Joss Whedon\u2019s gonna show some deleted scenes and do a question and answer session.\nSheldon: Oh, well, I have a few questions for him about the last Avengers movie, and a whole lot of answers.\nLeonard: When\u2019s the screening?\nRaj: Uh, it\u2019s tonight, but it\u2019s first-come, first-served, so we should probably get there early and wait in line.\nHoward: Let\u2019s do it.\nLeonard: Penny\u2019s busy with my mother, so I\u2019m in.\nSheldon: Oh, bad news. Amy\u2019s making me go shopping with her later, so looks like none of us can go.\nLeonard: You do realize we\u2019re allowed to have fun without you?\nHoward: In fact, that\u2019s usually the trick to it. What time do we need to get there?\nRaj: Uh, I\u2019d say by three.\nSheldon: You\u2019re really going without me?\nLeonard: It\u2019s not a big deal. Go shopping with Amy, and we\u2019ll save a spot in line for you.\nSheldon: You don\u2019t have the authority to save places in the line. If I do that, I\u2019ll be cutting.\nLeonard: People do it all the time.\nSheldon: You know the golden rule of line etiquette. No cuts, no buts, no coconuts.\nHoward: If you really care that much, there are apps now that\u2019ll let you hire people to do stuff like errands and wait in lines.\nStuart: People are actually waiting in lines as a job? Boy, makes me feel better about my life.\nHoward: Some of these guys make over $20 an hour.\nStuart: And now I feel worse again.\nScene: Penny\u2019s car.\nBeverly: I\u2019m not surprised Leonard chose to avoid picking me up. He\u2019s battled intimacy issues his whole life. Does he have difficulty maintaining erections?\nPenny: Wow. Didn\u2019t even make it out of the parking lot. Uh, you know what, enough about Leonard. Let\u2019s talk about you. What would you like to do while you\u2019re here?\nBeverly: Dear, I\u2019m a psychiatrist. You don\u2019t have to avoid having intimate conversations with me.\nPenny: Well, I\u2019d actually like for us to be close, but maybe we start with our favourite books and work our way up to my husband\u2019s sex organs.\nBeverly: Very well. What\u2019s the last book you read?\nPenny: Um, does Pottery Barn, Spring count?\nBeverly: Penny, it\u2019s only natural to want your mother-in-law to like you, and I acknowledge I can be an intimidating person. So what can I do to make this process easier for you?\nPenny: Uh, for starters, maybe you can not psychoanalyze everything I say?\nBeverly: And how does it make you feel when I psychoanalyze everything you say?\nPenny: Uncomfortable.\nBeverly: That was a joke, dear.\nPenny: Oh. Sorry. Didn\u2019t know you made those. Hey, listen, what if we have a little mother-in-law, daughter-in-law dinner tonight?\nBeverly: So just the two of us?\nPenny: Or I invite a few girlfriends, \u2019cause hearing you say the two of us just sent a chill right down my spine.\nScene: Amy\u2019s car.\nStuart: Hey.\nAmy: What are you doing here? You\u2019re not Sheldon.\nStuart: I thought that might come up. Sheldon hired me to go shopping with you.\nAmy: Hold on. He paid you to get out of spending time with me?\nStuart: No, it\u2019s not like that. There\u2019s a long line he\u2019d rather stand in. So what are we doing? Old Navy, Build-A-Bear? I get paid either way.\nAmy: We\u2019re not going shopping together.\nStuart: You sure? I\u2019m happy to hold your bag. And Sheldon gave me money for a hotdog on a stick.\nAmy: Can you understand why I might be annoyed right now?\nStuart: Look, lady, I just work here.\nScene: The cinema line.\nHoward: We\u2019ve waited in a lot of lines together, haven\u2019t we?\nSheldon: Remember when we camped out for the Doctor Who panel at Comic-Con?\nRaj: Yeah, sleeping under the stars with other fans who love the show as much as we do.\nLeonard: Waking up, wondering which one of those fans stole our wallets.\nSheldon: Stuart, what are you doing here?\nStuart: Sheldon, you are the most inconsiderate person I have ever met in my entire life. Where do you get off sending me to shop with your girlfriend?\nSheldon: I don\u2019t understand. You were happy to do this when I hired you. Why, why are you upset with me now?\nStuart: Oh, I\u2019m not upset with you, but Amy\u2019s pretty bent out of shape, so she hired me to let you have it.\nSheldon: Well, I suppose turnabout is fair play.\nStuart: You\u2019re darn right it\u2019s fair play, you selfish jerk.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment.\nAmy: You know, just when I think we\u2019re making progress in our relationship, we revert to our old patterns where thoughts and feelings go unexpressed. I mean, if he didn\u2019t want to go shopping with me, why didn\u2019t he just say so?\nBeverly: Maybe he couldn\u2019t get a word in edgewise.\nAmy: I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019ve been going on and on.\nBeverly: Oh, it\u2019s all right, dear. Sheldon has a brilliant and complicated mind. It\u2019s understandable that being in a relationship with him could be trying.\nAmy: I called him babe once. He asked me to get a drug test.\nBeverly: Well, I do admire your resolve. You\u2019re an extraordinary woman.\nAmy: Thank you.\nPenny: You know, she\u2019s my mother-in-law. Why can\u2019t I bond with her like that?\nBernadette: Amy\u2019s with Sheldon who she loves like a son. You\u2019re with her son, who she doesn\u2019t.\nAmy: Do you realize it took me five years to get a massage from him?\nBeverly: Oh, well, that still could be a big step for Sheldon.\nAmy: Three minutes. And he used a kitchen timer. I felt like a soft-boiled egg.\nPenny: You know, being in a relationship with Leonard also comes with its challenges.\nBeverly: Yes. Well, what can you do?\nAmy (knock on door): Maybe it\u2019s Sheldon, here to say he\u2019s sorry.\nStuart: Sheldon says he\u2019s sorry.\nAmy: Bernadette, I\u2019ll give you five dollars to slam the door.\nStuart: I would have done it for three.\nScene: The cinema line.\nRaj: Boy, all this standing\u2019s making me tired. Good thing I brought my collapsible stick chair.\nHoward: Not the stick chair. You look like an idiot on that thing.\nRaj: Sticks and stones may break my bones, but chairs on sticks are comfy.\nStuart: Hey.\nSheldon: Hey. Is everything smoothed out with Amy?\nStuart: Uh, no, she\u2019s still pretty mad.\nSheldon: Did you make the apology as sincere as I would have?\nStuart: I said, Sheldon says he\u2019s sorry.\nSheldon: Oh, well, that\u2019s laying it on a little thick.\nLeonard: You think it\u2019s time you apologize to her yourself?\nSheldon: I suppose so. But if I get out of the line, I\u2019ll lose my spot.\nStuart: I\u2019m happy to hold your place till you get back.\nSheldon: You would do that?\nStuart: Consider it my way of getting more of your money.\nSheldon: You\u2019re a good man.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment.\nBernadette: So, Beverly, did you know Penny is the number three sales rep at our pharmaceutical company?\nBeverly: Oh, I didn\u2019t realize you two work together.\nBernadette: Well, we don\u2019t exactly. I\u2019m a microbiologist for the research team.\nBeverly: Oh, what are you currently developing?\nBernadette: Some exciting new anti-anxiety drugs.\nBeverly: That\u2019s interesting. I just attended a lecture on pediatric anxiety.\nAmy: Oh, was it, uh, Dr. Jenofski? I just saw his TED Talk.\nBeverly: It was.\nBernadette: Well, let\u2019s get back to Penny. Hey, weren\u2019t you telling me something great about your company car?\nPenny: Um, it has seat warmers.\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy.\nAmy: Come in.\nSheldon: Hello, everyone. Oh, Beverly, good to see you. I\u2019d love to chat, but there\u2019s a line that could start moving any minute, so let\u2019s do this. Amy? A proper apology requires three steps. Step one, an admission of wrongdoing. Amy, I was wrong. Step two, a promise never to repeat said action. Amy, that action will never be repeated, and that\u2019s a promise. Step three, an earnest request for forgiveness. Amy, I hope you can forgive me. And I hope you do it right now, \u2019cause there\u2019s an Uber waiting downstairs, and I don\u2019t want to repeat this apology nonsense with my driver Ganesh.\nAmy: Fine.\nSheldon: Oh, thanks, you\u2019re a peach. Beverly, we\u2019ll catch up soon. Bernadette, it was a pleasure as always, Penny, you have spinach in your teeth.\nPenny: How long have I had spinach in my teeth?\nBeverly: Since the airport, dear.\nScene: The cinema line.\nHoward: You look like you come with a kickstand.\nRaj: You can\u2019t make me feel bad.\nHoward: Hmm, maybe not. Leonard?\nLeonard: So, when the aliens brought you back, they just left the probe in?\nSheldon: I\u2019m back.\nLeonard: Hey, how\u2019d it go?\nSheldon: It went well. Yeah, I\u2019ve learned that if you never say you\u2019re sorry, the times you do really puts them on their heels. Uh, Stuart, I relieve you of your line duties.\nStuart: Anyone else need anything before I go?\nHoward: I\u2019ll give you a dollar if you make fun of Raj.\nStuart: That\u2019s mean.\nHoward: Five.\nStuart: You look like Tigger if Tigger looked like a jackass.\nHoward: Uh, if you ever need a reference or anything, just let me know.\nMan: Hey, guys.\nWoman: You made it.\nSheldon: Did you see that? He just cut the line.\nLeonard: He\u2019s just joining his friends; it\u2019s fine.\nSheldon: No, it\u2019s not fine. It is a breach of line etiquette.\nHoward: We\u2019re near the front of the line. We\u2019ll get in either way.\nSheldon: What if every person in front of us let someone cut?\nLeonard: We\u2019d still get in.\nSheldon: What if each of those people let someone cut?\nLeonard: Still get in.\nSheldon: But then each of those people let someone cut?\nLeonard: We\u2019d still get in, but first I\u2019d hit you over the head with his stick chair.\nSheldon: Excuse me.\nLeonard: Oh, please don\u2019t.\nSheldon: Uh, uh, I couldn\u2019t help but notice that you cut the line.\nMan: Oh, uh, I\u2019m with my friends. It\u2019s cool.\nSheldon: Well, no. It\u2019s not cool. If there were reserved seating, and we all had tickets, that would be fine. But this line is first-come, first-served. Not show up tardy and nevertheless be first served. Right here.\nLeonard: No.\nSheldon: You need to go to the back of the line.\nMan: Uh, who made you line monitor?\nSheldon: Mrs. Wunch in fourth grade. And my slogan was a line that\u2019s straight is a line that\u2019s great.\nMan: Is this guy for real?\nLeonard: Boy, I wish I could say no.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment.\nBeverly: That was very nice of Sheldon to apologize.\nAmy: Well, he\u2019s come a long way. Or a short way very slowly, so it feels like a long way.\nBeverly: Your relationship with him is fascinating. I\u2019m preparing to write a book on high-achieving couples, and I would love to interview the both of you.\nAmy: Oh, sure. I\u2019ll, I\u2019ll talk to Sheldon about it. You know, Bernadette\u2019s husband is a former astronaut.\nBeverly: Really? Do you think he would be interested in being interviewed as well?\nBernadette: Do I think he\u2019d be interested? Sometimes I hear him pretending to be interviewed when he\u2019s alone in the bathroom.\nBeverly: Wonderful. I\u2019ll give you my contact information.\nBernadette: Um, you should probably talk to Penny, too.\nBeverly: About what?\nPenny: Okay, you know what? This is ridiculous. I\u2019ve been trying to make a connection with you all day, and clearly I\u2019m getting nowhere.\nBeverly: Well, are you seeking a connection or just some form of validation?\nPenny: What I was seeking was some sort of friendship. But at this point, I\u2019ll take you not insulting me to my face.\nBeverly: My intention was never to insult you.\nPenny: You\u2019ve been doing it all day. Do you even know what an insult is?\nBeverly: Well, it\u2019s not a clinical term. But one example would be your marrying my son, and not inviting me or even telling me the wedding was taking place.\nPenny: Okay, good example.\nScene: The cinema line.\nSheldon: What about Joss Whedon\u2019s work makes you think he\u2019d be okay with rule-breakers and line-cutters?\nMan: The Avengers are rule-breakers. Being vengeful is in their job description.\nSheldon: They work for SHIELD, which is a sanctioned department of the U.S. Government. Do you work for a sanctioned department of the U.S. Government?\nMan: As a matter of fact I do. At a little place called the DMV.\nRaj: He\u2019s got him there. The D even stands for department.\nSheldon: Excuse me, excuse me, can I please see a show of hands? Who here takes issue with this person cutting the line?\nMan: Told you.\nSheldon: Well, what a sad state of affairs. That you\u2019ve all been so ground down by life, you don\u2019t even notice when someone disrespects you.\nHoward: I can\u2019t believe we\u2019re gonna get beat up, and it\u2019s not because of your chair.\nSheldon: You know, right now, at the back of this line, there\u2019s a movie fan like you who\u2019s not going to get in, because this person simply doesn\u2019t care. Yeah, well, 61 years ago, there was another person at the back of the line and her name was Rosa Parks.\nLeonard: Okay, you may have to pretend you\u2019re black to get us out of here.\nSheldon: Now, let\u2019s follow in that brave woman\u2019s footsteps, and stand up for ourselves. And, and I realize that she stood up by remaining seated, but now is not the time to enjoy the irony of that. Now, I ask you again. Who here takes issue with this person\u2026\nWoman: Why should we listen to you? You cut the line yourself.\nSheldon: I most certainly did not.\nWoman: I saw you.\nMan: If you\u2019re feeling dizzy, it\u2019s because the tables have turned.\nSheldon: Excuse me, I paid someone to wait in line for me, and then when I arrived, he left, so what you saw, my good woman, was swapsies, not cutsies. Oh, no, no, no, no, wait, I ask you all again, a show of hands. Who here takes issue\u2026 well, stop moving. he\u2019s gonna get in.\nLeonard: Buddy, let it go.\nSheldon: No, I can\u2019t. This isn\u2019t right.\nLeonard: You did everything you could.\nSheldon: No, I could\u2019ve done more.\nLeonard: Now, now, you denigrated the memory of a great civil rights pioneer. That\u2019s all anyone could ask.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment.\nPenny: To be honest, I\u2019m surprised you cared about the wedding at all.\nBeverly: I\u2019m still human, Penny. Not getting invited to my own son\u2019s wedding is difficult to ignore.\nAmy: I know how you feel. She didn\u2019t invite any of us.\nPenny: It was spur of the moment.\nBernadette: But we did get to see a live stream of it on the Internet.\nBeverly: I could\u2019ve watched it on the Internet?\nPenny: Thank you. So if we would have asked you to come to Vegas to see us get married, you would\u2019ve come?\nBeverly: No, I would\u2019ve said you\u2019re making a huge mistake. But an invitation would\u2019ve been nice.\nPenny: You really think we made a mistake?\nBeverly: At the time I did. But I\u2019ve never seen Leonard so happy, so perhaps I was wrong.\nPenny: Wow. Okay. Well, um, how about this? Maybe while you\u2019re still in town, Leonard and I could have another small ceremony. You know, if you\u2019re interested.\nBeverly: I would find that perfectly acceptable.\nPenny: She would find it perfectly acceptable. You guys saw it. We bonded.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s bedroom.\nBernadette: Howie? You doing okay? You\u2019ve been in there a while.\nHoward (through bathroom door): I\u2019m fine. Be right out. Am I an American hero? Well, that\u2019s a good question, Jim. Don\u2019t you think once an astronaut leaves the planet, he\u2019s a hero to all the nations of the Earth? Okey dokey. I think I have time for one more question.\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "2_7": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The apartment. The guys are playing Boggle.

Have it.\nLeonard: Pukhpa.\nAll: Have it. Got it. Yup.\nHoward: I have Chorrr.\nRaj & Sheldon: Got it. Yup.\nHoward: Nekhmakh.\nRaj & Sheldon: Yeah. Yeah.\nHoward: And Kreplach.\nRaj: Hold on a second. Kreplach?\nHoward: Yeah.\nRaj: That isn\u2019t Klingon, it\u2019s Yiddish for meat-filled dumpling.\nHoward: Well, as it turns out, it\u2019s also a Klingon word.\nLeonard: Really? Define it.\nHoward: Kreplach, A hearty Klingon\u2026 dumpling.\nRaj: Judge\u2019s ruling?\nSheldon: Bilurrrbe.\nPenny (entering): Hey, guys, I need to use your TV.\nSheldon: What\u2019s wrong with your TV?\nPenny: I don\u2019t know, it just died, I\u2019m getting a bunch of static.\nHoward: Did you pay your cable bill?\nPenny: You sound just like the cable company. All right, so, shh, Tyra Banks is about to kick someone off\u00a0 America\u2019s Next Top Model.\nSheldon: Excuse me, Penny, but we\u2019re\u2026\nLeonard: No, no, don\u2019t tell her.\nSheldon: \u2026playing Klingon Boggle.\nLeonard: Aw!\nHoward: What do you mean, aw? Like she didn\u2019t know we were nerds?\nSheldon: All right, if you must watch, then mute it with closed captions, please.\nPenny: Fine.\nSheldon: All right, Boggle warriors, kapla\u2019!\nHoward: Look at those women.\nLeonard: They\u2019re gorgeous.\nSheldon: Oh! Worf, nice! Too bad that\u2019s a proper noun.\nHoward: Oh, look, the\u2019s the future Mrs. Wolowitz. No, wait, that\u2019s the future Mrs. Wolowitz. With her head in the lap of, what a coincidence. It\u2019s the future Mrs. Wolowitz.\nLeonard: Yeah, and they can all move in with you and your mother, the current Mrs. Wolowitz.\nSheldon: Is qochbe\u2019 spelled with a (gargling) or a (guttural grunt)?\nHoward: Why is that Mrs. Wolowitz crying?\nPenny: Oh. That\u2019s Anais, none of the other girls in the house like her.\nHoward: House? What house?\nPenny: They all live in a house together.\nHoward: A house, where?\nPenny: I don\u2019t know. Somewhere in L.A.\nHoward: Wait a minute, you\u2019re telling me that I\u2019m within driving distance of a house filled with aspiring supermodels?\nPenny: Yeah, I guess.\nHoward: And they live together and shower together and have naked pillow fights?\nLeonard (to Penny who has got up to leave): Hey, wh-where are you going?\nPenny: To pay my cable bill.\nSheldon: All right, pencils down! I have lokh, makh, and cherrrkh. Anybody got those?\nCredits Sequence.\nScene: The living room. Howard and Raj are staring intently at the television. Leonard enters.\nLeonard: Did I miss anything? Did they kick Giselle off?\nRaj: Not yet, but her underwater photo shoot was an embarrassment.\nHoward: Sadly, Mrs. Giselle Wolowitz is sensitive to chlorine. Lucky for her I like my fashion models pruny and bug-eyed.\nLeonard: Sheldon, the food\u2019s here.\nRaj: There\u2019s the house, freeze frame, freeze frame.\nLeonard: What are you doing?\nRaj: Marking the star positions and physical landmarks so we can find the house of the supermodels.\nLeonard: Why?\nHoward: Isn\u2019t it obvious? Every week, they kick out a beautiful girl, making her feel unwanted and without self-esteem, a.k.a. the future Mrs. Howard Wolowitz.\nSheldon: Is my hamburger medium well?\nLeonard: Yes.\nSheldon: Dill slices, not sweet?\nLeonard: Yes.\nSheldon: Individual relish packets?\nLeonard: Yes.\nSheldon: Onion rings?\nLeonard: Yes.\nSheldon: Extra breading?\nLeonard: I asked.\nSheldon: What did they say?\nLeonard: No.\nSheldon: Did you protest?\nLeonard: Yes.\nSheldon: Vociferously?\nLeonard: No.\nSheldon: Well, then what took you so long?\nLeonard: Just eat.\nPenny (entering): Hey, guys, what\u2019d I miss? What\u2019d I miss?\nHoward: Giselle\u2019s hanging by a thread.\nPenny: Oh, good, I hate her.\nHoward: Then you\u2019re not invited to our wedding.\nLeonard: Here you go.\nPenny: Thank you.\nSheldon: Oh, do we have to suffer through this transparently manipulative pseudo-reality again?\nAll: Yes.\nSheldon: You and I have a standing TV schedule which is the result of extensive debate and compromise. Any alterations except for breaking news have to be pre-approved at the weekly roommate meeting.\nLeonard: Put it on the agenda.\nSheldon: But you have to make a motion to put it on agenda.\nLeonard: Oh, I\u2019ll make a motion, but you\u2019re not going to like it.\nSheldon: Fine. Mock Parliamentary procedure. At least put it on mute.\nPenny: Oh, Giselle\u2019s not getting kicked off. It\u2019s totally going to be Summer. (She picks up one of Sheldon\u2019s onion rings. Raj lets out a high pitched squeak and points.) What?\nLeonard: Sheldon\u2019s onion ring. Just put it back!\nPenny: It\u2019s one onion ring.\nHoward: Just put it back before he comes!\nLeonard: No, no, no,\u00a0 no, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s where it was.\nHoward: Okay, here he comes, deny, deny, people, wall of silence.\nSheldon: Who touched my\u2026\nAll: Penny! Penny did it.\nSheldon: Why would you do that?\nPenny: I don\u2019t know. I was hungry? What\u2019s the big deal?\nSheldon: The big deal is that nobody touches food on my plate.\nPenny: All right. Look, I didn\u2019t know, I\u2019m sorry.\nSheldon: Well, I\u2019m sorry, but that is your second strike.\nPenny: What?\nSheldon: You have two strikes. Three strikes and you\u2019re out. It\u2019s a sports metaphor.\nPenny: A sports metaphor?\nSheldon: Yes, baseball.\nPenny: All right, yeah, I\u2019ll play along. What was my first strike?\nSheldon: March 18th. You violated my rule about forwarding email humour.\nPenny: I did?\nSheldon: The photo of the cat who wants to \u201chas cheezburger\u201d?\nPenny: Oh, come on, everybody loves LOLcats. They\u2019re cute and they can\u2019t spell \u2019cause they\u2019re cats.\nSheldon: I trusted you with my email address, and you betrayed that trust by sending me Internet banality, strike one. Touching my food, strike two.\nLeonard: Don\u2019t worry. They only stay on your record for a year.\nHoward: You can get them removed early, but you have to take his class.\nPenny: Come on, I touched one onion ring.\nSheldon: And then you put it back, compromising the integrity of all the other onion rings.\nPenny: Oh, honey, the buses don\u2019t go where you live, do they?\nSheldon: Look, Penny, I wish I could be more lenient with you, but since you\u2019ve become a permanent member of our social group I have to hold you to the same standards as everybody else.\nLeonard: Congratulations. You\u2019re officially one of us.\nHoward: One of us, one of us.\nPenny: Well, what a thrill.\nSheldon: You\u2019re sitting in my spot.\nPenny: Oh, jeez, you\u2019ve got to be kidding me.\nSheldon: Leonard, she\u2019s in my spot.\nLeonard: Yeah, yeah. Uh, see, here\u2019s the thing, after you leave, I still have to live with him.\nPenny: I don\u2019t care. I\u2019m taking a stand. Metaphorically.\nSheldon: All right, that\u2019s it. Strike three.\nPenny: Ooh, strike three.\nScene: The hallway, Penny exits the guys apartment.\nPenny: I\u2019m banished? What the hell kind of crap is that?\nLeonard: Listen, don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll talk to him.\nPenny: Yeah, you do that.\nLeonard: Just so I know, would you be open to taking his class? You can do it online!\nScene: The Cheesecake Factory.\nHoward: So based on our triangulation we\u2019ve narrowed down the location of the top model house to three square miles in the Hollywood Hills.\nRaj: Or possibly Durham, North Carolina.\nHoward: When we find it, you want to go with us?\nLeonard: To do what?\nRaj: Party with the pretty girls, dude!\nLeonard: Are you insane? You\u2019re not going to party with them, you\u2019re not even going to get anywhere near that place.\nHoward: That\u2019s what they said to Neil Armstrong about the moon.\nSheldon: No one said anything of the kind to Neil Armstrong, the entire nation dedicated a decade of effort and treasure to put a man on the moon.\nHoward: Well, my fellow Americans, before this year is out we will put a Wolowitz on one of America\u2019s top models.\nRaj: And a large number of people will believe it never happened.\nPenny (arriving): Okay, let me guess. A quesadilla with soy cheese for the lactose-intolerant Leonard.\nLeonard: Thank you.\nPenny: Shrimp Caesar salad with no almonds for the highly allergic kosher-only-on-the-high-holidays Howard, and for our suddenly back on the Hindu wagon Raj, meatlover\u2019s pizza, no meat. Coming right up.\nSheldon: Wait. Excuse me. You forgot my barbecue bacon cheeseburger, barbecue sauce, bacon and cheese on the side.\nPenny: Oh, I didn\u2019t tell you? You\u2019re banished from the Cheesecake Factory.\nSheldon: Why?\nPenny: Well, you have three strikes. One, coming in. Two, sitting down. And three, I don\u2019t like your attitude.\nSheldon: You can\u2019t do that. Not only is it a violation of California state law, it flies directly in the face of Cheesecake Factory policy.\nPenny: Yeah, no, there\u2019s a new policy. No shoes, no shirt, no Sheldon.\nHoward: I bet we could sell that sign all over Pasadena.\nLeonard: Penny, can I talk to you for a minute? Hi.\nPenny: Hi.\nLeonard: Look, here\u2019s the thing, um, I talked to Sheldon and he feels terrible and he agrees that he was unreasonable and out of line.\nPenny: Really? Well, that\u2019s great.\nLeonard: Yeah, so just apologize to him, okay?\nPenny: What? I\u2019m not going to apologize to that nutcase.\nLeonard: Oh, come on, it\u2019s easy, he\u2019ll even tell you what to say.\nPenny: Leonard, don\u2019t you get it? If you guys keep going along with his insanity, you\u2019re just encouraging him.\nLeonard: We\u2019re not encouraging. It\u2019s more like knuckling under.\nPenny: Look, I like hanging out with you guys, but I\u2019m not going to apologize for something I didn\u2019t do.\nLeonard: Well, actually, technically, you did do it.\nPenny: That\u2019s strike one, Leonard.\nScene: The same, some minutes later.\nPenny: There you go, quesadilla, salad, there\u2019s your pizza, and thanks to Sheldon\u2019s heated discussion with my manager one barbecue bacon cheeseburger, barbecue sauce, bacon and cheese on the side.\nSheldon: Thank you.\nPenny: Go ahead, eat it. I dare you\nScene: The living room. Howard on his laptop.\nHoward: That\u2019s it. There\u2019s the house, I found America\u2019s top models!\nRaj: Are you sure?\nHoward: Look, on the roof, Anais and Giselle are sunbathing. European-style.\nLeonard: You can recognize people on Google Earth?\nHoward: Of course not, I got a buddy of mine at NORAD to have a spy drone fly over.\nLeonard: NORAD? You\u2019re using military aircraft?\nHoward: It was already targeted to poke around a nuclear reactor in Siberia, I took it an hour out of its way, tops.\nPenny (entering, angry): Okay, where is he?\nLeonard: Sheldon? I just dropped him off at the comic book store. Why?\nPenny: Here. Try and go online.\nLeonard: Problem with the WiFi?\nPenny: No, just try.\nSheldon (on screen): Greetings, hamburger toucher. You are probably wondering why you cannot IM with your little friends about how much you heart various things. Well, this recorded message is alerting you that I am putting an end to your parasitic piggybacking upon our WiFi. If you want to remedy the situation you can contact the phone company, set up your own WiFi and pay for it, or you may apologize to me.\nPenny: Well?\nLeonard: I reiterate, knuckle under.\nPenny: No, no, no, no, no. It is on. I am gonna introduce your friend to a world of hurt.\nLeonard: Oh, Penny, you don\u2019t want to get into it with Sheldon. The guy is one lab accident away from being a supervillain.\nPenny: I don\u2019t care, I was in junior rodeo, I can hogtie and castrate him in 60 seconds.\nHoward: No need to neuter the nerd, I can get you back online.\nLeonard: There, see? Problem solved.\nHoward: Voila!\nSheldon (voice from Howards laptop): Hello, puny insects. As a consequence of your efforts to circumvent my will, everyone is awarded one additional strike.\nLeonard: Thanks a lot, Howard.\nHoward: What are you complaining about? I\u2019m the one who has to take the class again.\nScene: The hallway. Sheldon is backing out of the apartment. Penny is waiting outside.\nSheldon: Oh! Hello.\nPenny: Time to do your laundry, huh?\nSheldon: It\u2019s Saturday night. Saturday is laundry night.\nPenny: I know. Every Saturday at 8:15, easy to anticipate.\nSheldon: What are you implying?\nPenny: I\u2019m implying that you\u2019re a creature of habit, and if something were to prevent you from doing your laundry on Saturday at 8:15, you might find it unpleasant. (Sheldon hurries away, disturbed) Knuckle under, my ass.\nScene: The laundry room. Sheldon, holding his laundry, is looking at the machines in dismay.\nPenny: Oh, no, are all the machines taken? What are you gonna do?\nSheldon: No problem, I\u2019ll just do my laundry another night.\nPenny: Another night? Well, I guess you can try, but deep inside your heart you\u2019ll know that laundry night is always Saturday night.\nSheldon: Woman, you are playing with forces beyond your ken.\nPenny: Yeah, well, your ken can kiss my Barbie.\nScene: The hallway, Penny comes storming up the stairs to the guys door.\nPenny (Knock, knock, knock): Sheldon (knock, knock, knock) Sheldon (knock, knock, knock) Sheldon.\nSheldon: Yes?\nPenny: Where are my clothes?\nSheldon: Your clothes?\nPenny: Yes, I left them in the washers and when I went down to get them, they were gone.\nSheldon: Really? Despite the sign that says \u201cDo not leave laundry unattended\u201d?\nPenny: Sheldon, where are my clothes?\nSheldon: You know, I do recall seeing some female undergarments. Where was that? Oh, yes, earlier this evening I happened to gaze out the window and a brassiere caught my eye. Do those look familiar?\nPenny: How the hell did you get them up on that telephone wire?\nSheldon: When you understand the laws of physics, Penny, anything is possible. And may I add, mwah-ha-ha!\nPenny: Get them down.\nSheldon: Apologize.\nPenny: Never.\nSheldon: Well, then may I suggest you get a very long stick and play panty pinata.\nPenny: Look, wait, Sheldon, this has gotten out of hand, okay? I\u2019ve done some stupid things, you\u2019ve done some stupid things, how about we just call it even and move on with our lives?\nSheldon: I\u2019ve done no stupid things.\nPenny: Look, you\u2019ve got to meet me halfway here.\nSheldon: I am meeting you halfway, I\u2019m willing to concede that you\u2019ve done some stupid things.\nLeonard: Hey, you guys are talking again. Good. What happened?\nPenny: Leonard, remember when I said it was on? Well, now it\u2019s junior rodeo on.\nLeonard: Oh, not junior rodeo. What did you do?\nSheldon: I had no choice, Leonard, she ruined laundry night.\nLeonard (looking out of window): A-a-a-aw!\nSheldon: Mwah-ha-ha.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment. Leonard enters. Penny is taping together a number of long sticks.\nPenny: Telephone wires can\u2019t electrocute you, can they?\nLeonard: No. Look, this has to stop.\nPenny: Oh, no, no, no. It is just beginning.\nLeonard: All right, I really didn\u2019t want to do this, but\u2026 here.\nPenny: What\u2019s this?\nLeonard: Sheldon\u2019s Kryptonite.\nPenny: Oh, my God.\nLeonard: He can never know that I gave that to you.\nPenny: Look, I said I wanted to hurt him, but, but this?\nLeonard: It\u2019ll shorten the war by five years and save millions of lives.\nScene: The living room.\nRaj: Oh, pause it. That\u2019s it. Confirmed. We now have the address of the top model house.\nHoward: God bless you, Google Street View registered trademark.\nLeonard: Okay, for the record what you\u2019re doing is really creepy.\nHoward: You know what? If it\u2019s creepy to use the Internet, military satellites, and robot aircraft to find a house full of gorgeous young models so that I can drop in on them unexpectedly, then fine, I\u2019m creepy.\nLeonard (into phone, which has just rung): Hello. Oh, hi. Yeah, hold on a second. I\u2019ll get him. Sheldon, it\u2019s for you.\nSheldon: Who is it?\nLeonard: Your mother.\nSheldon: Oh, good. Hi, Mom. How are you? But, Mom, she keeps sitting in my spot. And, and she touched my food. Okay, yes, I took her clothes, but she started it. No, that\u2019s not fair. Why should I have to apologize? Yeah, I really don\u2019t think this is the kind of thing Jesus concerns himself with. No, you\u2019re right, I don\u2019t really know what Jesus thinks about. All right, good-bye. Did you tell on me?\nLeonard: Are you kidding me? I already have two strikes.\nScene: Outside Penny\u2019s door.\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Penny, (knock, knock, knock) Penny, (knock, knock, knock) Penny\u2026 (door opens) I am very, very sorry for what I have done. Here\u2019s your laundry, I rescind your strikes and you are no longer banished.\nPenny: Can I sit wherever I want? No, no, never mind, never mind, that\u2019s, that\u2019s not important. Sheldon, this was big of you. Thank you. I really appreciate it.\nSheldon: Thank you.\nPenny: Good night, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Penny.\nPenny: Yes?\nSheldon: Well played.\nPenny: Thank you.\nSheldon: Just remember: with great power comes great responsibility.\nPenny: Understood.\nScene: The top model house. The doorbell rings. One of the models answers. Howard and Raj are outside wearing blue jumpsuits.\nModel: Can I help you\nHoward: Yes, we here to fix the cable.\nModel: I think we have satellite.\nHoward: That\u2019s what I meant.\nModel: Oh. Okay, come on in.\nHoward: She\u2019s taller than all the women in my family combined.\nRaj: What do we do now?\nHoward: Follow Mrs. Wolowitz.\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "6_5": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The Comic Book Store\nHoward: Oh, hey, Stuart, I got you a little souvenir from my trip to space.\nStuart: Well, Howard, that\u2019s very nice of you.\nLeonard: Yeah, maybe. Open it first.\nHoward: It\u2019s my official NASA portrait.\nStuart: To Stuart, your comic book store is out of this world. Just like the guy in this picture was.\u201d\nSheldon: For the record, he also thinks the Walgreens and the dry cleaners are out of this world.\nHoward: That\u2019s not true. At the Walgreens I was over the moon for their store-brand antacids.\nRaj: Hey, Stuart, I see you\u2019re getting ready for your Halloween party.\nStuart: Yeah, it\u2019s my annual attempt to meet women. Ninth time\u2019s the charm.\nRaj: Would you like me to help? I do have a certain je ne sais quois when it comes to soirees.\nStuart: Thanks, but I can\u2019t afford je ne sais quois. How much for just quois?\nRaj: You know, you don\u2019t worry about money. I\u2019ll take care of everything.\nStuart: Really?\nRaj: Yeah, you\u2019ll love it. Ain\u2019t no party like a Koothra-party.\nHoward: But you know what wasn\u2019t a party? That hotel in Kazakhstan they put you up in before the launch. I mean, it\u2019s your last night on Earth. You\u2019d think you\u2019d get one porn channel.\nLeonard: Have you noticed that Howard can take any topic and use it to remind you that he went to space?\nSheldon: Interesting hypothesis. Let\u2019s apply the scientific method, perform an experiment.\nLeonard: Okay. Hey, Howard, any thoughts on where we should get dinner?\nHoward: Anywhere but the Space Station. On a good day, dinner was a bag full of meat loaf. But, hey, you don\u2019t go there for the food, you go there for the view.\nSheldon: It\u2019s fascinating. Let me see if I can duplicate the result. Howard, I\u2019ve always thought the lemon was an underrated fruit. Care to weigh in?\nHoward: Not really.\nSheldon: Oh, well.\nHoward: You know, people say the Soyuz capsule was a lemon. But, hey, that baby got me to space and back.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The Cheesecake Factory Bar\nAmy: Ladies night at the Cheesecake Factory. Does it get any better than this?\nPenny: I hope so.\nAmy: Question. Do you think your husband\u2019s fondness for turtlenecks is an expression of longing for his missing foreskin?\nPenny: It\u2019s not getting any better. (Text tone) Ugh. It\u2019s Leonard. He wants to go costume shopping later.\nBernadette: I thought you liked Halloween.\nPenny: I do, it\u2019s just he wants to go to that party at the comic book store. A lot of the guys that hang out there are kind of creepy.\nBernadette: Like my husband?\nAmy: And my boyfriend?\nPenny: I\u2019m, I\u2019m sorry, Amy. You were saying something about Howard\u2019s foreskin?\nBernadette: Nice try, but you have to go to that party because we\u2019re going.\nPenny: Yeah, I\u2019m gonna go. It\u2019s just not my idea of a good time.\nBernadette: Leonard does thing he doesn\u2019t like to make you happy.\nPenny: Well, yeah, he\u2019s my boyfriend. Isn\u2019t that, like, his job?\nAmy: Then what\u2019s your job?\nPenny: Letting him make me happy.\nBernadette: I just think in relationships you get back what you put into them.\nAmy: That\u2019s not always true. Last night I gave Sheldon my best come-hither look, and he responded by explaining how wheat came to be cultivated.\nPenny: I guess I could probably try a little harder.\nBernadette: You could start by taking an interest in his work.\nPenny: Yeah, that\u2019s kind of a problem.\nAmy: Why?\nPenny: Not really clear on what he does.\nBernadette: He\u2019s an experimental physicist.\nPenny: Yeah, I\u2019m not really clear on what that means.\nAmy: He takes hypotheses and designs protocols to determine their accuracy.\nPenny: Yeah, you\u2019re really just making it worse.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: What kind of tea would you like?\nAmy: I think I\u2019m gonna try green tea mixed with lemon zinger.\nSheldon: Two tea bags in one cup? You\u2019re not at a rave.\nAmy: So, listen, Sheldon, I was thinking, since this is gonna be our first Halloween party as boyfriend and girlfriend, I thought it might be fun for us to go in a couples costume.\nSheldon: I couldn\u2019t agree more.\nAmy: Really? I find that inconsistent with everything I know about you.\nSheldon: Oh, oh, on the contrary. Couples costumes are one of the few benefits of being in a relationship. Now imagine this, you and I entering Stuart\u2019s party and all eyes turn to see America\u2019s most beloved and glamorous couple.\nAmy: Yeah?\nSheldon: R2-D2 and C-3PO. Dibs on Threepio.\nAmy: Sheldon, when I said couples costume, I meant like Romeo and Juliet or Cinderella and Prince Charming, not two robots from some silly movie I don\u2019t even like.\nSheldon: Okay, I\u2019m gonna let that slide because I know you\u2019re hopped up on tea bags.\nAmy: I make compromises for you all the time. Just this once, can\u2019t we find something that we\u2019re both happy with?\nSheldon: Fine. How about one of the most beguiling and influential couples of the 20th century? Hewlett and Packard. Dibs on Hewlett. What? You want to be Hewlett?\nScene: Leonard\u2019s laboratory.\nPenny: Anybody home?\nLeonard: Hey, what are you doing here?\nPenny: I just thought I\u2019d stop by and say hello.\nLeonard: Oh, what a nice surprise. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve ever seen my lab before.\nPenny: No, I know. It\u2019s long overdue. So, what ya doing? Better not be building a robot girlfriend.\nLeonard: No. Although Howard was making some real strides in that area until he met Bernadette.\nPenny: You\u2019re kidding.\nLeonard: Nope. Now the Lisatronic 3000 just sits in a box waiting for the phone to ring.\nPenny: Ooh! What\u2019s going on in here?\nLeonard: Oh, no, no, no, don\u2019t look in there.\nPenny: What, is it secret?\nLeonard: No, it\u2019s a nitrogen laser. It\u2019ll cook your eyeball like a soft-boiled egg.\nPenny: Oh. You might want to put a sign on it.\nLeonard: Sign right there.\nPenny: Ah. Danger. Sure, sure. Yeah. What\u2019s, what\u2019s that?\nLeonard: Uh, that is an integrated ion trap and time-of-flight mass spectrometer.\nPenny: Wow. High-techie-techie. What\u2019s this little box?\nLeonard: That is a pencil sharpener.\nPenny: Ooh, low-techie-techie. So, what are you working on right now?\nLeonard: It\u2019s actually pretty neat.\nPenny: Yeah?\nLeonard: Yeah. It\u2019s a front-projected holographic display combined with laser-based finger tracking. Here, I\u2019ll show you. We\u2019ll just put this pencil over here.\nPenny: Sharp. Thanks to the machine we saw earlier.\nLeonard: Very good. And then a laser will map the reflective surface, and voila. (A floating 3D image of the pencil appears. Leonard moves it around with his finger)\nPenny: Wow. That is amazing.\nLeonard: You know, there\u2019s a foundational idea in string theory that the whole universe may be a hologram.\nPenny: What do you mean? (Leonard flicks a switch. The hologram changes to a view of the planet Earth). Oh! Wow!\nLeonard: Uh-huh. Well, the holographic principle suggests that what we all experience every day in three dimensions may really (changes view to solar system) just be information (changes view to the galaxy) on a surface located at the farthest reaches of our cosmos. (Starts the galaxy spinning) So it\u2019s possible that our lives are really just acting out a painting on the largest canvas in the universe.\nPenny: Hmm.\nLeonard: What?\nPenny: Sometimes I forget how smart you are.\nLeonard: You should visit more often. What are you doing?\nPenny: Take off your clothes.\nLeonard: What? Here? Now?\nPenny: Yeah. You got a problem with that?\nLeonard: No, no. It\u2019s kind of crazy. I\u2019ve never fooled around in the lab before.\nPenny: Really? Never?\nLeonard: No. I did have a shot with the Lisatronic, but the extension cord wasn\u2019t long enough.\nScene: The cafeteria.\nRaj: Before I forget, I\u2019d like your opinion on the menus I\u2019ve prepared for the Halloween party. The theme is food that goes bump in the night.\nHoward: Creature from the Black Forest Ham Lagoon.\nRaj: On Sesame seed Bunzillas.\nSheldon: Night of the Living Garlic Bread?\nRaj: It\u2019s funny because bread sounds like dead.\nSheldon: I\u2019m sorry, but these are just ordinary foods with the names bent into tortured puns. The dishes themselves are in no way Halloweenie.\nRaj: Ooh, Hallow-weenies! That\u2019s a good one. They\u2019ll pair nicely with my Draculoni and Cheese. How do I do it?\nHoward: That reminds me, I was thinking about wearing my NASA jumpsuit as a costume. But then I realized everyone would be, like, where\u2019s your costume? Why are you wearing your work clothes, you nut?\nLeonard: Hello, boys.\nSheldon: What are you smiling at?\nLeonard: Nothing.\nHoward: You know where\u2019s there\u2019s a lot of nothing.\nAll: Space.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s bedroom.\nHoward: Boy, it\u2019s nice to sleep in a bed with gravity again. Did I tell you about the night my retainer floated out of my mouth and into the air lock?\nBernadette: Yeah, you mentioned it once or twice.\nHoward: So, here we are, just a couple of young newlyweds. What to do? What to do to you? Astronaut Wolowitz, reporting for booty. Preparing thrusters. We have liftoff. Are we clear to jettison that nightgown?\nBernadette: Okay, we need to talk.\nHoward: What?\nBernadette: Howie, I know you went to space. I\u2019m incredibly proud of you. But you might want to try and not bring it up every minute.\nHoward: I don\u2019t talk about it every minute.\nBernadette: Tonight at dinner you went on bout it for an hour straight.\nHoward: What was I supposed to talk about? We were eating at Johnny Rockets.\nBernadette: I\u2019m just saying, people are getting a little tired of it.\nHoward: So, I did this amazing thing and I\u2019m never allowed to mention it?\nBernadette: Of course you can. But maybe a good rule would be to wait for people to bring it up.\nHoward: Okay, no problem. It won\u2019t happen again.\nBernadette: I love you.\nHoward: I love you, too. I can\u2019t tell you how many times I dreamed I was in bed here with you when I was\u2026 you know. What, I can\u2019t even point?\nScene: Leonard\u2019s lab.\nLeonard: So, basically, this is what\u2019s called mag-lev technology. It uses very powerful electromagnets to create a force strong enough to overcome gravity. Here, you hold this.\nPenny: Whoa! That\u2019s heavy.\nLeonard: Yeah. Oh, uh, you don\u2019t have on any jewellery, do you?\nPenny: No. Why?\nLeonard: A grad student forgot to take out one of his piercings. Now he\u2019s on a transplant list waiting for a nipple his size. Now watch this.\nPenny: Whoa! That is very cool.\nLeonard: Sometimes I like to turn this on and pretend I\u2019m the super villain Magneto.\nPenny: Getting a little less cool, Leonard.\nLeonard: But what I really am is a very smart scientist who understands the mechanics of the universe and is wearing the sexy black underwear you bought him.\nPenny: There we go.\nScene: The cafeteria.\nRaj: So, I thought the photo booth for the party could either be creepy like a mummy\u2019s tomb, or they also have the Tardis from Doctor Who.\nSheldon: A Tardis makes no sense. It\u2019s a time machine from a science-fiction show. It has nothing to do with Halloween. That being said, if you don\u2019t get a Tardis, you stink and your party stinks.\nRaj: Do you have a preference?\nHoward: I don\u2019t care. Get the Tardis.\nSheldon: Yes! This party just became a major rager.\nRaj: Oh, by the way, can I borrow your bullwhip and fedora?\nHoward: Yeah, sure, whatever.\nRaj: I was thinking of dressing up as Indiana Jones\u2019 mocha-skinned love child. Indian Jones.\nHoward: Clever.\nRaj: What\u2019s wrong with you?\nHoward: Nothing.\nRaj: Oh, Howard, I\u2019ve got a party to plan. Don\u2019t make me pull it out of you.\nHoward: Okay, here it is. Bernadette said you guys are all sick of me talking about my trip to space. Is that true?\nSheldon: Yes.\nRaj: No.\nSheldon: We seem to have different approaches here. I was going for helpful honesty. I have no idea what you\u2019re doing.\nRaj: It\u2019s called being nice.\nSheldon: Okay. If you think being nice will get him to shut up, I\u2019ll try it.\nHoward: You know what, guys? Never mind. I just won\u2019t talk about the greatest achievement of my life ever again.\nSheldon: Look at that, the problem solved itself.\nLeonard: Hello, boys.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: What if we were to go as dinner table favourites salt and pepper?\nAmy: You know salt makes me retain water and my cousin William was ground to death in a pepper factory accident. How about Raggedy Ann and Andy? I loved them growing up.\nSheldon: No, I don\u2019t think so. Those dolls represent three things I do not care for, clowns, children and raggediness. I think it\u2019s a lost cause.\nAmy: No. There are certain things that say to the world, I have a boyfriend, and he\u2019s not made up. Matching costumes, hickeys and sex tapes. Pick one.\nSheldon: What\u2019s a hickey?\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s bedroom. Howard and Bernadette are dressed as smurfs.\nBernadette: How do I look?\nHoward: Fine.\nBernadette: Uh-oh, is someone a little blue? Come on, Howie, that\u2019s like the funniest thing I\u2019ve ever said in my life. What do you say? You ready to go?\nHoward: To tell you the truth, I\u2019m not really in the mood.\nBernadette: What are you talking about? It\u2019ll be fun. All your friends\u2019ll be there.\nHoward: Yeah, some friends. They all think I\u2019m boring. Maybe you should go without me.\nBernadette: No, if I\u2019m there alone, people might think I\u2019m just a really short person from Avatar.\nHoward: I\u2019m sorry. I just don\u2019t want to go.\nBernadette: Hey, I just spent the last three hours colouring myself blue. I\u2019m gonna be washing paint out of my Smurf for a month.\nHoward: Fine. Two weeks ago I was an astronaut.\nBernadette: Yeah, well, now you\u2019re a Smurf. Keep walking.\nScene: The comic book store.\nPenny: Oh, my God, you guys look adorable.\nBernadette: Thanks, so do you. Slutty cop?\nPenny: No, sexy cop. Slutty cop only came with a skirt and two badges.\nBernadette: And Albert Einstein?\nLeonard: Ja, und later she\u2019s going to arrest me for goink fashter zen da shpeed of light.\nPenny: I thought we said in the car, no accents?\nLeonard: Sorry, Officer.\nGirl dressed as a Witch: Hello. It\u2019s a great party.\nStuart: Thank you.\nWitch: The monster foods, they\u2019re really fun.\nStuart: Oh, yes, thank you. I like to think of fun things like that because I\u2019m fun. I\u2019m not clinically depressed at all.\nAmy: Sheldon, get in here.\nSheldon: I should\u2019ve picked hickey.\nStuart: Hey, hey, look at you guys!\nAmy: I\u2019m Raggedy Ann, and he\u2019s Raggedy C-3PO.\nSheldon: It was a compromise. I lost.\nRaj: Can you believe Stuart\u2019s walking around taking credit for this party?\nHoward: Who cares?\nRaj: What do you mean who cares? Look at what I pulled off here. The DJ\u2019s on fire, there\u2019s a Tardis photo booth in the back room, and, oh, my God, the food. Stuart wanted Kraft Draculoni and cheese.\nHoward: You\u2019re right, the party\u2019s fantastic. Please, tell me more. I haven\u2019t heard enough about it all week because hearing about that never gets old.\nRaj: Is this about the space thing again?\nHoward: Well, I\u2019m not allowed to talk about it, but since you brought it up, I went to space! Space, space! Space! Space, space! Space!\nBernadette: Whoa, Drinky Smurf. Can I talk to you for a second?\nHoward: Great, now I\u2019m in trouble. You happy?\nBernadette: You, out! You are being very rude.\nHoward: No, I\u2019m not. They\u2019re all being rude. And you\u2019re being rude.\nBernadette: Me? What did I do?\nHoward (in a squeaky voice): Oh, Howie, stop talking about space so much. Nobody likes it.\nBernadette (in a gruff voice): I don\u2019t sound like that.\nHoward: You\u2019re my wife. You\u2019re supposed to be on my side.\nBernadette: I\u2019m always on your side.\nHoward: Then why are you trying to take this away from me? Being an astronaut is the coolest thing I\u2019m ever gonna do. If I stop talking about it, then I\u2019m just\u2026\nBernadette: Just what?\nHoward: Just plain old Howard Wolowitz again.\nBernadette: Plain old Howard Wolowitz is the best guy I know.\nHoward: You\u2019re just saying that.\nBernadette: No, I\u2019m not. I married him. On purpose. Come here.\nHoward: I love you.\nBernadette: I love you, too.\nPenny (emerging from Tardis): Nothing to see here. Just sexy police business.\nLeonard: Just explaining the theory of relativity. Twice.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s bedroom.\nBernadette: Hey, what you watching?\nHoward: I don\u2019t know. Raj sent me some video of Buzz Aldrin.\nBuzz (on video, handing Halloween candy to children): Here you go. It\u2019s a Milky Way. The Milky Way\u2019s a galaxy in space. I\u2019ve been in space. Here\u2019s a Mars bar. I\u2019m an astronaut. And this one\u2019s a Moon Pie. I walked on the Moon. What have you done?\nHoward: Okay, I get it.\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "2_15": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The apartment. The guys are playing Rock Band. Sheldon is on guitar, Howard drums and Raj singing. They are performing the Red Hot Chili Peppers \u201cUnder the Bridge\u201d. As Raj gets into the song, Penny enters and his singing turns into a squawk.\nPenny: Fellas, please.\nHoward: Penny, come on, we were just finding our sound.\nPenny: You found it. It\u2019s the sound of a cat being run over by a lawn mower.\nLeonard (entering on the phone): I\u2019m really very busy. Is there any way that we can put this off until I have more time to prepare? Of course. But, uh, you understand my trepidation.\nPenny: What\u2019s that about?\nHoward: Not a clue.\nLeonard: Can\u2019t we just postpone it till the spring? Maybe next summer?\nSheldon: This should be fairly easy to deduce. He\u2019s holding the phone to his left ear. Ears do not cross hemispheres, so he\u2019s using the analytical rather than the emotional side of the brain, suggesting that he has no personal relationship with the caller.\nLeonard: No, I didn\u2019t realize it had been so long. Sure, I guess there\u2019s no other choice but to just go ahead and do it.\nSheldon: He\u2019s referring to an activity he has done before. It\u2019s unpleasant and needs to be repeated. This suggests some sort of invasive medical test, like perhaps a colonoscopy.\nLeonard: Aren\u2019t there any other options? There\u2019s not a lot of room, it\u2019s gonna be uncomfortable.\nSheldon: Yes, yes. Yeah, I\u2019m definitely going with colonoscopy.\nLeonard: Okay, bye. My mother\u2019s coming to visit.\nHoward: How about that, you were right.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The lobby. Penny finds a woman studying the lift.\nPenny: It\u2019s out of order.\nWoman: Yes, I can read the sign, I\u2019m just pondering the implications.\nPenny: I think it implies that the elevator doesn\u2019t work.\nWoman: Again, I can read the sign. But the sign and the tape are covered with a layer of dust, which indicates that the elevator has been non-functional for a significant amount of time. Which suggests either a remarkable passivity among the, I assume, 24 to 36 residents of this building based on the number of mailboxes and given typical urban population density or a shared delusion of functionality.\nPenny: You must be Leonard\u2019s mother.\nLeonard\u2019s Mother: Oh, I don\u2019t know if I must be, but yes.\nPenny: Uh, I\u2019m Penny. I\u2019m his neighbour.\nLeonard\u2019s Mother: Oh, Dr. Beverley Hofstadter.\nPenny: Oh, nice to meet you.\nBeverley: Oh, you\u2019re a hand shaker. Interesting.\nPenny: Uh, why don\u2019t you come with me. I\u2019ll walk you to the apartment.\nBeverley: Oh, all right. Would you like to exchange pleasantries on the way?\nPenny: Yeah, sure, I guess.\nBeverley: All right, you start.\nPenny: Okay. You know, I\u2019ve always been curious. What was Leonard like when he was little?\nBeverley: Oh, I think you mean young. He\u2019s always been little.\nPenny: Right, okay. What was he like when he was young?\nBeverley: You\u2019ll have to be more specific.\nPenny: Oh, um, okay, like, five or six. Five.\nBeverley: Oh, well, at that age he was well enmeshed in what Freud would call the phallic stage of psychosexual development. An outmoded theory, of course, but the boy did spend most of his waking hours with a tight grasp on his penis.\nPenny: Yeah, Leonard mentioned you were a psychiatrist.\nBeverley: Well, that is one of my degrees. My primary field is neuroscience.\nPenny: Oh, well, I\u2019m an actress.\nBeverley: Why?\nPenny: What do you mean why?\nBeverley: Well, there are studies that suggest that many who go into the performing arts suffer from an external locus of identity.\nPenny: Yeah, I don\u2019t know what that means.\nBeverley: Well, it means you value yourself only as others value you, which is often the result of unmet childhood emotional needs.\nPenny: Oh, well, I had a wonderful childhood.\nBeverley: Tell me about it.\nSlight time shift.\nPenny: I know my dad wanted a boy. I just, I tried being good at sports, but I hated getting dirty!\nBeverley: And then, I\u2019m assuming, you entered adolescence.\nPenny: Uh-huh, he called me Slugger until I got my first training bra, and then he just stopped playing catch with me. I wasn\u2019t Slugger anymore. Your mother\u2019s here!\nBeverley: If you want to have intercourse with that girl, find out what kind of cologne her father wore.\nLeonard: Good to see you, Mother.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: Here\u2019s your tea, Mother.\nBeverley: Oolong?\nLeonard: Yes.\nBeverley: Loose, not bagged?\nLeonard: Yes.\nBeverley: Steeped three minutes?\nLeonard: Yes.\nBeverley: Two-percent milk?\nLeonard: Yes.\nBeverley: Warmed separately?\nLeonard: Yes.\nBeverley: One teaspoon sugar?\nLeonard: Yes.\nBeverley: Raw sugar?\nLeonard: Yes.\nBeverley: It\u2019s cold.\nLeonard: I\u2019ll start again.\nSheldon: I have the same problem with him. My theory is that his lack of focus stems from an over-developed sex drive.\nBeverley:\u00a0 Oh, I don\u2019t know where he would\u2019ve gotten that. Aside from a pro forma consummation of our marriage, his father and I only had intercourse for the purposes of reproduction.\nSheldon: That seems a fairly efficient arrangement.\nBeverley: Yes, we think so. We\u2019ve both done papers on it. Mine from the neuroscientific point of view and his from an anthropological. Mine, of course, was the only one worth reading.\nSheldon: Of course. I would very much like to read about your sex life.\nBeverley: Well, it\u2019s all online or you can order it from the Princeton University Press.\nLeonard: Here\u2019s your tea, Mother. So, what are you guys talking about?\nSheldon: The frequency with which your parents had intercourse.\nLeonard: Swell. If you\u2019re lucky, maybe she\u2019ll show you the PowerPoint presentation.\nBeverley: I\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s on my other laptop.\nSheldon: Aw\u2026\nLeonard: So, Mother, what\u2019s new?\nBeverley: You\u2019ll have to be more specific.\nLeonard: All right. Uh, what\u2019s new with you?\nBeverley: Oh, well, I\u2019ve been having some fascinating menopausal symptoms recently.\nLeonard: Maybe something less personal.\nBeverley: Oh. Your Uncle Floyd died.\nLeonard: Oh, my God. What happened?\nBeverley: His heart stopped beating. I have to urinate.\nSheldon: What a remarkable woman.\nLeonard: Yeah I, I thought you guys might hit it off.\nSheldon: I envy you your childhood.\nLeonard: I hate to tell you, but the only warm memories I have of my childhood are of my Uncle Floyd.\nSheldon: You\u2019re clearly misremembering. Your mother is brilliant, analytical, insightful, and I\u2019m betting she never hit you with a Bible because you wouldn\u2019t eat your Brussels sprouts.\nLeonard: Sheldon, you don\u2019t give your mother enough credit. She\u2019s warm, she\u2019s loving, she doesn\u2019t glue electrodes to your head to measure your brain waves while potty training.\nSheldon: You were lucky. When I was a kid, if I wanted an EEG, I had to attach my own electrodes.\nScene: The university cafeteria.\nHoward: So, Dr. Hofstadter, Leonard rarely talks about his incredibly successful brother and sister.\nLeonard: Please, don\u2019t go there, Howard.\nHoward: I understand that unlike Leonard, they\u2019re at the top of their respective fields.\nLeonard: Boy, you suck.\nBeverley: Well, Leonard\u2019s younger brother, Michael, is a tenured law professor at Harvard, and his sister just successfully grew a human pancreas in an adolescent gibbon.\nHoward: So, she\u2019s close to curing diabetes?\nBeverley: Why else would you grow a pancreas in a teenaged gibbon?\nHoward: Wow, you must be very proud.\nBeverley: Why? They\u2019re not my accomplishments. I have to urinate.\nLeonard: Why are you doing this?\nHoward: You know the rules. You brought your mom to work, you must suffer.\nSheldon: Leonard, I had no idea your siblings were so much more successful than you.\nRaj: Yeah, you\u2019re like the Jar Jar Binks of the Hofstadter family.\nHoward: Oh, meesa think yousa lookin\u2019 so so sad.\nLeonard: You know, rather than mock me, my friends might realize that this is difficult and try to help me through it.\nRaj: Nope, I think mocking you is more fun.\nHoward: Next time, don\u2019t yousa bring mama to work. Okee-day?\nLeonard: That was fast.\nBeverley: Oh, the middle stall was occupied. I\u2019ll have to try again later.\nSheldon: It\u2019s totally understandable. In bladder voiding, as in real estate, it\u2019s location, location, location.\nBeverley: So, where were we?\nLeonard: Howard lives with his mother and Raj can\u2019t speak to women unless he\u2019s drunk. Go.\nBeverley: That\u2019s fascinating. Selective mutism is quite rare. On the other hand, an adult Jewish male living with his mother is so common it borders on sociological clich\u00e9.\nHoward: It\u2019s just temporary, I pay rent.\nLeonard: He lives in the same room where his bassinet was.\nBeverley: You know, both selective mutism and an inability to separate from one\u2019s mother can stem from a pathological fear of women. It might explain why the two of you have created an ersatz homosexual marriage to satisfy your need for intimacy.\nHoward: Say what? (Raj whispers in his ear) That\u2019s basically what I just said.\nLeonard: You brought your husband to work, you know the rules. Meesa thinking yousa looking pretty sad now too, betcha, betcha.\nBeverley: Leonard, it\u2019s one o\u2019clock, weren\u2019t you going to show me your laboratory at one o\u2019clock?\nLeonard: There\u2019s no hurry, Mother, tell them more about their secret love for each other.\nBeverley: But it\u2019s one o\u2019clock, you were going to show me your laboratory at one o\u2019clock.\nSheldon: Her reasoning is unassailable. It is one o\u2019clock.\nLeonard: Fine. Let\u2019s go. I think you\u2019ll find my work pretty interesting. I\u2019m attempting to replicate the dark matter signal found in sodium iodide crystals by the Italians.\nBeverley: So, no original research?\nLeonard: No.\nBeverley: Well, what\u2019s the point of my seeing it? I could just read the paper the Italians wrote.\nHoward: Just for the record, we\u2019re not in an ersatz homosexual relationship.\nRaj: Well, then why didn\u2019t you say that to her?\nHoward: Why is it always my responsibility?\nRaj: It\u2019s not always your responsibility. I swear, this is the same thing you did at the comic book store last week.\nHoward: I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re bringing that up.\nRaj: I didn\u2019t bring it up. You did.\nHoward: We\u2019ll talk about this later.\nRaj: You always say that, but we never do.\nSheldon: You went to the comic book store without me.7\nScene: Outside Penny\u2019s door.\n\u00a0\nPenny: Hey.\nLeonard: You got alcohol?\nPenny: Your mom still here?\nLeonard: Yep.\nPenny: Come on in. Wait, wait, she\u2019s not gonna come here looking for you, is she?\nLeonard: Oh, relax. She took Sheldon to the hospital to get a brain scan.\nPenny: Oh, my God. What happened?\nLeonard: Nothing. Mother likes looking at brains and Sheldon likes getting his brain scanned.\nPenny: Geez, what a fun couple.\nLeonard: She\u2019s only been here a day and a half and I\u2019m seriously considering alcoholism as a new career path.\nPenny: Hey, I talked to her for five minutes yesterday and I\u2019ve been half bombed ever since.\nLeonard: You can\u2019t let her get into your head.\nPenny: My head, what about yours?\nLeonard: It\u2019s too late for me. My head is her summer house.\nPenny: She was right, you know. The locus of my identity is totally exterior to me.\nLeonard: Oh, yeah, there she is. Hi, Mom.\nPenny: I mean, do you know where I was all morning? Auditioning with 50 other blondes for some stupid antidepressant commercial. And for what? So I\u2019ll finally get my daddy\u2019s approval?\nLeonard: Did you get the part?\nPenny: No, they said I was too perky.\nLeonard: Hey, you want to talk about not getting love from a parent. You know what I used to do when I was little to have some sensation of human contact?\nPenny: Yeah, you grabbed your penis and wouldn\u2019t let go. Your mother told me.\nLeonard: Of course she did. Anyway, that\u2019s not what I was gonna say. When I was ten years old, I built a hugging machine.\nPenny: A hugging machine?\nLeonard: Yeah. I got a dressmaker\u2019s mannequin, I stuffed it with an electric blanket so it would be warm, and built two radio-controlled arms that would hug me and pat my back.\nPenny: Oh, that is so sad.\nLeonard: You know what the saddest part was?\nPenny: What?\nLeonard: My father used to borrow it.\nScene: The stairwell.\n\u00a0\nBeverley: Your scan data will be very elpful to my research. You have a remarkable brain.\nSheldon: I know. Although I\u2019ve always hated how my right frontal lobe looks in pictures.\nBeverley: Common complaint among men. Nothing\u2019s ever big enough, except when they get a tumour. Then you never hear the end of it.\nSheldon: I\u2019d love to see a scan of your brain sometime.\nBeverley: Oh, I\u2019ll send you a link, but its physiology is fairly unimpressive.\nSheldon: Oh, I can\u2019t believe that.\nBeverley: Your unwillingness to accept empirical evidence suggests an attempt at flattery.\nSheldon: My apologies. I\u2019ve been living with your son too long. Gotten into some bad habits.\nBeverley: Understandable.\nSheldon: Can I make you a cup of tea?\nBeverley: I doubt it, but if anyone has a chance, it\u2019s probably you.\nSheldon: I feel very comfortable around you.\nBeverley: I feel very comfortable around you, too.\nSheldon: It\u2019s surprising because I generally don\u2019t feel comfortable around, well, anyone.\nBeverley: Nor I.\nSheldon: What are the odds that two individuals as unique as ourselves would be connected by someone as comparatively workaday as your son?\nBeverley: Is that a rhetorical point or would you like to do the math?\nSheldon: I\u2019d like to do the math.\nBeverley: I\u2019d like that, too.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment. Penny and Leonard are doing tequila shots. \nPenny: Okay, now this time\u2026\nLeonard: Uh-huh.\nPenny: You\u2019re gonna lick the salt off my neck, do the shot, and then bite the lime.\nLeonard: I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t hear anything after lick.\nPenny: Neck, shot, lime. (Leonard starts licking her neck. He is there a long time) Okay, shot, lime.\nLeonard: Right. Ah! Where\u2019s the lime? (Penny has the lime in her mouth) Oh, okay, we\u2019re sharing.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: So, what do you think?\nBeverley: I\u2019m very tempted. I\u2019m just not sure it\u2019s appropriate with my son\u2019s roommate.\nSheldon: Normally, I\u2019d feel the same way. But based on everything I\u2019ve observed about us, I can\u2019t help but speculate we\u2019d be very good together.\nBeverley: True. I\u2019ve had a similar observation. It\u2019s certainly something I could never do with my husband.\nSheldon: I was hesitant the first time I tried it, but I experienced an unanticipated and remarkable release of endorphins. It\u2019s quite satisfying.\nBeverley: I see what you\u2019re doing. You\u2019re appealing to the neuroscientific researcher in me.\nSheldon: You see right through me, don\u2019t you?\nBeverley: Only when you\u2019re in a CAT scanner.\nScene: Penny\u2019s bedroom. Penny and Leonard are in bed. \nLeonard: This is actually gonna happen.\nPenny: Honey, shush, shush, shush, shush, shush.\nLeonard: You shush, I\u2019m happy, I want to talk about it. You know what my mother would say about this? She would say because you were not loved by your father and I was not loved by my mother, that having sex is our way of making up for the intimacy we didn\u2019t get as children.\nPenny: Why would you bring that up right now?\nLeonard: I don\u2019t know. Foreplay?\nPenny: So you\u2019re saying you\u2019re not having sex with me, you\u2019re having sex with your mother?\nLeonard: Ummm, I\u2019m gonna go with \u201cno.\u201d\nPenny: That is the sickest thing I\u2019ve ever heard.\nLeonard: Come on, you\u2019re trying to have sex with your father, and I\u2019m okay with that.\nScene: Penny\u2019s front door. \n\u00a0\nPenny: Get out!\nLeonard: She said shush. I should have shushed. (Enters apartment. Sheldon and Beverley are inside duetting on Journey\u2019s \u201cAny Way You Want It\u201d on Rock Star.)\n\u00a0\nScene: The hallway. \nLeonard: All right, Mother. Um, have a nice flight.\nBeverley: That\u2019s not really in my control, is it? Oh, uh, yes (gives him a very uncomfortable hug.)\nPenny (coming out of her apartment): Oh, good morning.\nLeonard: Morning.\nPenny: Look, I was just coming over to talk to you.\nLeonard: You don\u2019t have to. Ever.\nPenny: Gotcha.\nLeonard: Good-bye, Mother.\nBeverley: Good-bye, Leonard. So, Slugger, shall we pick up where we left off last time?\nSlight time shift.\n\u00a0\nPenny (in tears): I mean, my mom could\u2019ve just said, \u201cBob, get over it, she\u2019s a girl, move on.\u201d But she didn\u2019t. Not one word.\nBeverley: Interesting. Would you be willing to fly to New Jersey and discuss your relationship with your parents during a brain scan?\nPenny: Would it help?\nBeverley: Well, it would help me.\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "6_16": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: Penny\u2019s apartment.\nPenny: You\u2019ll never believe what happened to me at work today.\nLeonard: Hmm?\nPenny: This old guy was choking on his food, and I saved his life.\nLeonard: You\u2019re kidding. Did you Heimlich him?\nPenny: No. I said, oh, my God, I think that old guy\u2019s choking, and then one of the busboys Heimlich\u2019ed him.\nLeonard: You\u2019re a hero.\nPenny: Yeah, that was the point of the story.\nLeonard: Oh, yeah, speaking of work, do you know if you have Thursday night off?\nPenny: Um, I think so. Why?\nLeonard: What do you mean, why? It\u2019s Valentine\u2019s Day.\nPenny: Oh, right. Yeah, we can do something.\nLeonard: You could be a little more into it.\nPenny: No, I\u2019m into it, I\u2019m into it. Just, there\u2019s so much pressure to make the night special, and it never works out.\nLeonard: Okay, well, this time it\u2019s going to be different. Because I am like a romance ninja. You don\u2019t see it coming, and then bam, romance, watch out, hearts, kisses, love, ooh-ya!\nPenny: You know, sometimes I think I\u2019ve made you so much cooler than you used to be, and then you go and do that.\nScene: The stairwell.\nSheldon: So, in conclusion, I believe the painful sensation felt after passing a meal of spicy chillies is proof that the rectum does possess the sense of taste.\nAmy: I concur, but you changed the subject. What are we doing for Valentine\u2019s Day?\nSheldon: Oh, you caught that, did you?\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The comic book store.\nHoward (on phone): Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay! Okay.\nRaj: Everything okay?\nHoward: Bernie\u2019s a little cranky since she\u2019s been working, like, 17 hours a day. And I\u2019ve got a lot on my plate, too, because I\u2019ve been busting my tail playing Assassin\u2019s Creed.\nRaj: Hey, Stuart, you got anything going on for Valentine\u2019s Day?\nStuart: Not really. Other than hiding all the sharp objects around here and white-knuckling it till morning. What do you got going on?\nRaj: Oh, well, I was going to spend the night with my special little lady, but, uh, she got worms, and then I had to take her to the vet.\nStuart: There must be something we can do.\nRaj: Well, uh, how about you keep the store open late, and we throw a party for all the people who don\u2019t have dates?\nStuart That actually sounds kind of nice.\nRaj: Yeah, the theme will be that the greatest love a man can have is the love he has with himself.\nStuart: That\u2019s good. Or maybe something a little less hand in the pants.\nScene: Sheldon\u2019s office.\nSheldon: Ah, Alex, excellent. I have a research problem that I believe you can help with.\nAlex: Oh, Dr. Cooper, thank you. I\u2019ve been waiting for an opportunity to contribute to your scientific work.\nSheldon: Oh, no, no. That\u2019s not going to happen, no. What I need you to do is find a Valentine\u2019s gift for my girlfriend.\nAlex: You realize I passed up an opportunity to work at Fermilab to take this job with you.\nSheldon: Well, I guess those chaps will have to have someone else buy their girlfriends presents. Now, here is, let\u2019s see, this is, this is about two thousand dollars, um, I think she likes monkeys and the colour grey. Contribute to my work. Ah, kids say the darnedest things.\nScene: Howard\u2019s lab.\nLeonard: Hey, you coming to lunch?\nHoward: Yeah, one second. Come here. I want to show you something.\nLeonard: What you looking at?\nHoward: Well, I was trying to come up with something really romantic to give Bernadette for Valentine\u2019s Day since she\u2019s been such a pain in the ass.\nLeonard: You can\u2019t find a card that says that?\nHoward: Check it out. I used the atomic force microscope in the material science lab and wrote our initials in a heart one one-thousandth the size of a grain of sand.\nLeonard: Oh, that\u2019s cool.\nHoward: A micro-valentine for a microbiologist.\nLeonard: From her micro-husband. That is amazing. How long did this take you?\nHoward: Mmm, about twelve hours. I pulled an all-nighter.\nLeonard: Oh, wow.\nHoward: Yeah, I know, it really took a bite out of my video game time. What are you and Penny doing?\nLeonard: Oh, I\u2019m going to take her to a nice restaurant for dinner.\nHoward: Oh, that\u2019s not bad, but as far as romance goes, I think my gift hits it right out of\u2026 (Bumps into chair and drops the slide)\nLeonard: Want to come to dinner with us?\nHoward: Yes, please.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Okay. Amy will be here shortly, expecting the perfect Valentine\u2019s gift, so, you\u2019re up kid. Dazzle me. Go.\nAlex: Okay, I think I have some really great choices. I went on Amy\u2019s Facebook page and read up on her interests.\nSheldon: Now, see, I never would have thought to do that. Clearly, I made a good choice farming this out to you. But I am telling you, Amy hit the boyfriend jackpot. Anyway, my socks are on. Let\u2019s knock them off.\nAlex: Well, um, I know she loves playing the harp, so I found this beautiful music box that plays one of her favourite songs.\nSheldon: Now, Amy already has a real harp. And it can play any song. What are you trying to pull here?\nAlex: No, I just thought it would be\u2026\nSheldon: Next.\nAlex: Okay. Um, I know she\u2019s a fan of The Canterbury Tales.\nSheldon: Mmm.\nAlex: So I found this cool map that illustrates the character\u2019s journey through England. I thought we could put it in a really nice frame.\nSheldon: But she\u2019s got Google Maps on her phone.\nAlex: I don\u2019t know how to respond to that.\nSheldon: Well, I hope it\u2019s with a third good option, because these first two, buh.\nAlex: Okay. Well, uh, luckily, I saved the best for last. Since Amy\u2019s a neuroscientist, I did some research and found out that Santiago Ramon y Cajal, the father of modern neuroscience, did lots of hand drawings of brain cells. And I managed to find this signed print.\nSheldon: Wow. Oh, this is truly remarkable.\nAlex: Thank you.\nSheldon: I think I\u2019ll keep it for myself.\nAlex: What about your girlfriend?\nSheldon: It\u2019s too late. I call dibs.\nScene: a restaurant.\nPenny: This place is really beautiful.\nLeonard: Waugh, romance ninja.\nPenny: Hey.\nHoward: Sorry we\u2019re late.\nPenny: No problem. We just sat down.\nLeonard: Mmm, would you like some wine?\nBernadette: Yeah, fill her up. I\u2019ll tell you when to stop.\nPenny: Is everything okay?\nHoward: Terrific. Couldn\u2019t be better.\nBernadette: Oh, bite me.\nHoward: Look, we can still have a nice night. Just tell me where it is.\nBernadette: Maybe if you did what you said you were going to do, I\u2019d tell you.\nLeonard: Uh, where what is?\nHoward: She hid my Xbox like I\u2019m a child. Yeah, and my mom got me that for my birthday, so if you don\u2019t give it back, I\u2019m telling.\nBernadette: I\u2019ve been working late every night. All I asked was that he clean the apartment and do one load of laundry. But did he do it? No. He just kept on playing that stupid game. You like pushing buttons so much, try pushing them on the washing machine.\nHoward: I said I\u2019m sorry.\nBernadette: Sorry doesn\u2019t clean my underpants, buddy.\nHoward: I told you, turn them inside out.\nBernadette: And I told you to bite me.\nLeonard: Trying to have a magical night here, guys.\nPenny: Oh, son of a bitch.\nLeonard: What?\nPenny: Nothing. Nothing.\nLeonard: No, tell me.\nPenny: It\u2019s just this guy I used to date.\nLeonard: Oh.\nPenny: Until he cheated on me with my friend Gretchen, who\u2019s here with him now.\nLeonard: You\u2019re kidding.\nPenny: And it looks like she lost a lot of weight, damn it.\nLeonard: I know it\u2019s not ideal, but don\u2019t let them ruin our night.\nPenny: No, you\u2019re totally right. She could be skinny \u2019cause she\u2019s dying.\nLeonard: That\u2019s the spirit.\nPenny: You know what, screw them. Our night is going to be way more special than theirs.\nLeonard: Yeah.\nBernadette: Uh-oh.\nPenny: What? (Penny\u2019s ex is proposing to Gretchen) Oh, you got to be kidding me.\nGretchen: Oh, my God, yes. Of course I\u2019ll marry you.\nLeonard: Two can play this game. Penny\u2026\nPenny: Get up.\nLeonard: All right.\nScene: The comic book store.\nRaj: It\u2019s nice that all the people who are lonely on Valentine\u2019s Day can come here tonight and be together.\nStuart: Yeah, I\u2019m really looking forward to it. In fact, there\u2019s no place I would rather be than here.\nRaj: Except on a date with anybody.\nStuart: Literally anybody.\nRaj: You know, you and I have so much fun hanging out. If you were a girl, all our problems would be solved.\nStuart: What?\nRaj: Oh, yeah, think about it. We\u2019d hang out, we\u2019d read comic books, we\u2019d see movies. It\u2019d be like the best relationship ever.\nStuart: That does sound nice.\nRaj: Then I\u2019d take you home, slip off your little black dress and just pile-drive you into oblivion.\nStuart: What?\nScene: The restaurant.\nPenny: Oh, I can\u2019t believe he\u2019s going to marry the girl he cheated on me with.\nLeonard: Isn\u2019t it kind of nice? I mean, he was with the wrong person, and now he found the right person.\nPenny: What, so I\u2019m the wrong person? Maybe you want to be with Gretchen, too.\nBernadette: They do look happy.\nHoward: Yeah, maybe tonight. But a year from now, he\u2019ll be crawling under the sink looking for his Xbox. Well, he will.\nLeonard: You know what? Why don\u2019t we just forget about them and enjoy our Valentine\u2019s Day?\nPenny: Yes, absolutely. Now they\u2019re doing that phony link-arm-drink thingy. I totally taught him that.\nLeonard: I thought we were letting it go.\nPenny: We were; it\u2019s just, it\u2019s not fair, okay? They\u2019re bad people. It\u2019s not supposed to end happy for them, it\u2019s supposed to end happy for me.\nLeonard: Um, it did end happy for you. You\u2019re here with me.\nPenny: Yeah, yeah, I know.\nLeonard: Okay, this is getting a little hard to not take personally.\nPenny: Oh, come on, don\u2019t make this about you.\nLeonard: Oh, I\u2019m not. It\u2019s about you.\nPenny: Yeah, well, whatever, okay? I told you, Valentine\u2019s Day sucks.\nLeonard: This one does, and you\u2019re the reason why.\nPenny: What?\nBernadette: You know, compared to them, I\u2019m feeling pretty good about us.\nHoward: Me, too. How about we blow off dessert, go home early, I\u2019ll do that laundry.\nBernadette: Thank you.\nHoward: I love you.\nBernadette: Love you, too.\nHoward: So where\u2019d you hide it?\nBernadette: Where you\u2019d never look.\nHoward: Damn it, it\u2019s in the washing machine.\nScene: The apartment.\nAmy: Hello.\nSheldon: Hello.\nAmy: Happy Valentine\u2019s Day.\nSheldon: Okay. Shall we go to dinner?\nAmy: Hang on. As you know, I had planned a traditional evening of romance and gifts.\nSheldon: Yes, and as you know, I planned to pretend to enjoy it. I\u2019ve been working on this facial expression all day.\nAmy: And I appreciate your effort, but upon contemplation, I decided I was being selfish. So, I cancelled our dinner reservations and came up with an even better way to celebrate Valentine\u2019s Day.\nSheldon: What is that?\nAmy: By doing none of it. No dinner, no romance, no gifts. We stay here, order a pizza and watch one of your beloved Star War Trek things.\nSheldon: Really?\nAmy: Well, that\u2019s what you\u2019d love, isn\u2019t it?\nSheldon: More than anything.\nAmy: Well, then, that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do.\nSheldon: Well, I don\u2019t know what to say. This is the most thoughtful gift that anyone\u2019s ever given me. And that\u2019s including an amazing gift that I gave myself earlier today.\nAmy: I\u2019m your girlfriend. That\u2019s my job. And I know gift-giving puts a lot of pressure on you, so whatever you got me, you can return.\nSheldon: No. No, after everything you didn\u2019t do for me tonight, I want you to have it.\nAmy: What\u2019s this?\nSheldon: Read it.\nAmy: Sheldon Cooper, Caltech University employee information?\nSheldon: At the bottom.\nAmy: In case of emergency, please contact\u2026 Amy Farrah Fowler. And there\u2019s my phone number. This is the most beautiful gift you could\u2019ve ever given me.\nSheldon: Well, I thought, if I have a stroke or a kidney stone, who would I want to share that with?\nAmy: And you picked me.\nSheldon: It\u2019s like you said, you\u2019re my girlfriend.\nAmy: Oh, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Yeah. Okay. Stop ruining Valentine\u2019s Day and order my pizza.\nScene: The stairwell.\nPenny: Night.\nLeonard: Yep. You know what? That was pretty crappy of you. I mean, all I wanted to do was give you a great night, and it\u2019s like you-you went out of your way to destroy it.\nPenny: Yeah, I know. I\u2019m a total bitch.\nLeonard: I\u2019m not saying that.\nPenny: Well, I am.\nLeonard: Fine, you win. You\u2019re a bitch. Why couldn\u2019t we just have a nice time?\nPenny: I don\u2019t know. Maybe \u2019cause things are going so well between us lately and I\u2019ve been really happy.\nLeonard: Okay, you\u2019re gonna have to make a lot more sense than that.\nPenny: Obviously, I have some commitment issues.\nLeonard: Glaringly obvious. Go on.\nPenny: As long as things keep going great between us, you\u2019ll keep asking me to marry you, and eventually I\u2019m gonna end up saying yes, and then we\u2019re gonna be married forever, and the whole thing just freaks me out.\nLeonard: Okay. I know I propose a lot. So how about this? I promise I will never ask you to marry me again.\nPenny: What, what do you mean? Are you breaking up with me?\nLeonard: No. No, no, no, no. But if someday you decide you want to get married, you have to propose to me.\nPenny: Really?\nLeonard: Yes. It\u2019s all on you. But I got to tell you, when the time comes, I want the whole nine yards. I want you down on one knee, flowers, I want to be swept off my feet.\nPenny: Yeah, you got it.\nLeonard: And I\u2019m cool with surprises. But nothing on a Jumbotron. I don\u2019t want to cry on a big screen like that.\nPenny: Okay. You know what? This might be the wine talking, but I have a very important question to ask you.\nLeonard: You do?\nPenny: Leonard Hofstadter?\nLeonard: Yes?\nPenny: Will you be my valentine?\nLeonard: Sorry. Maybe next year. I\u2019m just kidding. Romance ninja. Let\u2019s have sex. Waugh!\nScene: The comic book store.\nNerdy guy: Thank you, guys, for doing this.\nRaj: We\u2019re glad you could make it.\nNerdy guy: Usually I spend Valentine\u2019s Day sad and alone. This year, I\u2019m just sad.\nRaj: What is it about this holiday that makes people so unhappy?\nStuart: I know. I hate myself most of the time, but tonight\u2019s the night I know everyone else does, too.\nNerdy guy: I think you\u2019re cool.\nStuart: Great.\nRaj: I got to tell you, we\u2019ve got to stop beating ourselves up like this. Excuse me, everybody. Can I have your attention, please? We\u2019re all here tonight because we have no one to be with. But that doesn\u2019t make us mutants. The only mutants here are in these comic books. We\u2019ve got to stop defining our self-worth by whether or not we\u2019re in a relationship. You know what I see when I look around? I see a room full of great people. So let\u2019s give ourselves a break. We are a community, and as long as we have each other, we\u2019re never truly alone.\nGirl: That was cool. What you said.\nRaj: You really think so?\nGirl: Yeah, I do.\nRaj: Thank you. Uh, would you like to, uh, get a cup, a cup of coffee or\u2026?\nGirl: Okay.\nRaj: Later, losers!\nScene: Amy\u2019s lab. Phone rings.\nAmy: Hello? Another medical emergency? What\u2019s wrong with him now? I seriously doubt he was bitten by a Chinese bird spider. How exactly does a bump feel Asian? Just put him on the phone. Sheldon, I am not driving over there again. Because I drove over there yesterday for a brain tumour that turned out to be an ice cream headache. Yes, I still want to be your emergency contact. Yes, you can eat your ice cream too fast and also have a brain tumour. I\u2019m on my way. Brain tumour would explain a lot.\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "8_19": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The apartment. \nSheldon: Leonard, I\u2019ve been working on an opening joke for our lecture at Berkeley.\nLeonard: Oh, I like to laugh.

Because his education hasn\u2019t prepared him for a career in the sciences.\nPenny: You know, when they chase you out of there, you only have to run faster than Sheldon.\nAmy: Are you all set for your trip?\nSheldon: Yeah, I think so.

Uh, let\u2019s see, we have seat protectors, uh, booties for my shoes, a clothespin for my nose. Oh, and a mirror on a stick, so I can make sure the person in the stall next to me isn\u2019t some kind of weirdo.\nPenny: You still worried some Berkeley girl is gonna steal him away?\nAmy: Yes, who do you think gave him the danger whistle?\nCredits sequence. \nScene: Leonard\u2019s car.\nSheldon: Would you like to play a physics car game I invented called I Can\u2019t Spy? It\u2019s all the nail-biting tension of I Spy but the added fun of subatomic particles and waves outside the visible spectrum.\nLeonard: If it\u2019s half as much fun as One Times Ten to the Fourth Bottles of Beer on the Wall, I\u2019m in.\nSheldon: I\u2019ll begin. Uh, I can\u2019t spy with my little eye something passing right through us.\nLeonard: That soy Frappuccino I had.\nSheldon: Will you please play the game? I can\u2019t spy with my little eye something passing right through us.\nLeonard: I don\u2019t know, um, if 65 billion solar neutrinos pass through a square centimetre every second, given the surface area of this car is about 60,000 square centimetres, that means 3.9 times ten to the 15th solar neutrinos?\nSheldon: I don\u2019t want to play anymore.\nLeonard: We haven\u2019t been on a road trip in a while. This is fun.\nSheldon: We get it, you won the game. Stop bragging.\nLeonard: No, listen, we wrote a paper together. Now we get to go to a university and talk about it? That\u2019s pretty cool.\nSheldon: I suppose it is. In fact, if you\u2019d like to celebrate with a little music, I\u2019d be okay with that.\nLeonard: What? This road trip just got crazy.\nSheldon: Play that funky music, white boy.\nLeonard: I\u2019m surprised you know that reference.\nSheldon: What reference?\nScene: Mrs Wolowitz\u2019s house.\nBernadette: So, I put stickers on everything we\u2019re gonna sell. We just need help taking it all out to the driveway.\nAmy: Can I be in charge of pricing? I\u2019ve been going to garage sales my whole life. Can you believe I got these pantyhose for a nickel?\nHoward: All right, Amy\u2019s in charge of pricing and being 75.\nRaj: Hey, Penny, can you give me a hand with this?\nPenny: Sure. Oh, we had one of these growing up. I used to play all the time.\nRaj: Oh, yeah? I love Ping-Pong.\nPenny: Oh, I meant beer pong.\nAmy: I had a table, too, but I didn\u2019t have any friends, so all I did was serve.\nBernadette: You know, you can leave one side up and play against it.\nAmy: And if I had a friend, they might have told me that.\nHoward: Excuse me. Why is there a sticker on this? It\u2019s my TARDIS from Doctor Who. I was planning on moving it in the house.\nBernadette: I think you just answered your own question.\nHoward: Come on, one day, this may double in value and be worth half what I paid for it.\nBernadette: Sweetie, we have a lot to do. We don\u2019t need to decide this right now.\nHoward: Well, I guess as long as you\u2019re keeping an open mind.\nBernadette: Of course.\nScene: Leonard\u2019s car. \u201cPlay that funky music, white boy\u201d is playing on the stereo.\nSheldon: So they\u2019re requesting that the white boy play the funky music, yes?\nLeonard: Yes.\nSheldon: And this music we\u2019re listening to right now is funky as well?\nLeonard: Sure.\nSheldon: Let me ask you this. Do you think this song is the music the white boy ultimately plays?\nLeonard: It could be.\nSheldon: So it\u2019s like the musical equivalent of Russell\u2019s Paradox, the question of whether the set of all sets that don\u2019t contain themselves as members contains itself?\nLeonard: Exactly.\nSheldon: Well then I hate it. Music should just be fun.\nLeonard: Making great time. Gonna be there pretty early.\nSheldon: Will our hotel room be ready?\nLeonard: I doubt it.\nSheldon: Aren\u2019t you worried that sitting in the lobby for a long period of time might attract the attention of the hotel detective?\nLeonard: If we do, we\u2019ll just tell him to hit the bricks, see?\nSheldon: Seems a little confrontational, but all right. You know, we won\u2019t be very far from Skywalker Ranch.\nLeonard: Oh, that\u2019s true. It\u2019s not like we can get in there.\nSheldon: Why not?\nLeonard: I don\u2019t think George Lucas put his headquarters in the middle of nowhere because he wanted people dropping in.\nSheldon: Yoda\u2019s swamp was in the middle of nowhere. Tatooine was in the middle of nowhere. Hoth was in the middle of nowhere. That\u2019s code, Leonard. He wants us to drop in.\nLeonard: We do have time. I mean, we could drive by and just look at it.\nSheldon: Yes. Oh, I\u2019m so excited. And I just can\u2019t hide it.\nLeonard: I\u2019m about to lose control, and I think I like it.\nSheldon: What are you talking about?\nScene: Mrs Wolowitz\u2019s house. \nPenny: So when do you guys think you\u2019re gonna move in?\nHoward: We\u2019re still figuring how much remodeling we want to do.\nBernadette: It\u2019s tricky finding the right balance between tasteful modern and Jewish mother tchotchke crapfest.\nAmy: Have you made a decision about the TARDIS? I think I can sell it if we call it Big British Porta-Potty.\nHoward: We\u2019re not selling it, it\u2019s mine.\nBernadette: You can\u2019t just decide. How about I arm-wrestle you?\nHoward: That\u2019s not fair. It\u2019s like me challenging you to a sexy pants contest.\nRaj: You could play Ping-Pong for it.\nHoward: I would do that.\nBernadette: How is that fair? You grew up with a table.\nHoward: Yes, but I mostly used it as a battlefield in an ongoing war between the Transformers and the ThunderCats for control of a bra I had found in the woods.\nPenny: Bernadette, for every episode of Doctor Who Leonard has made me sit through, I will play on your behalf and send that TARDIS back to Gallifrey, where I hate that I know it belongs.\nBernadette: Yes, Penny plays for me.\nHoward: That\u2019s not fair, she has upper body muscles.\nRaj: Dude, three-time Sanskriti School for Well-Born Boys badminton champion.\nHoward: That\u2019s right, okay, Raj can play for me.\nAmy: Ooh, you just chose champions. It\u2019s like we\u2019re re-enacting the ancient German practice of trial by combat.\nPenny: Yeah, it\u2019s also like when the Mountain fought the Red Viper in Game of Thrones.\nBernadette: Leonard makes you watch that, too?\nPenny: No, no, I like that show. It\u2019s got dragons and people doing it.\nHoward: So it\u2019s settled. The fate of Doctor Who\u2019s TARDIS will be decided by a Game of Thrones inspired death-match on the battlefield of ThunderCats versus Transformers.\nAmy: If you still have that bra, I\u2019ll give you a nickel for it.\nScene: Leonard\u2019s car. \nSheldon: There it is. It\u2019s just a gate. On a road.\nLeonard: Wasn\u2019t even that hard to find.\nSheldon: This is so amazing.\nLeonard: I know. You want to get a picture?\nSheldon: I want more than a picture. I want to go in.\nLeonard: Well, so do I, but they\u2019ll never let us.\nSheldon: Is that the attitude that helped you get Penny?\nLeonard: No, but I don\u2019t have three years to make that gate feel sorry for me.\nSheldon: There\u2019s a speaker box. Drive up, push the button, and let\u2019s see what happens.\nLeonard: Okay, yeah. What do we have to lose? I\u2019m a little nervous.\nSheldon: Well, get over it. Confidence is key in these situations.\nLeonard: Right.\nSheldon: You pushed it, are you out of your mind?\nVoice: May I help you?\nLeonard: Um, uh, uh, uh, we don\u2019t have an appointment, and, and we don\u2019t belong here, but we, we\u2019re, like, crazy-big fans. I mean uh, buh, buh, crazy for Star Wars crazy, not crazy like we have a backpack full of duct tape, although we do have a backpack that you really don\u2019t want to look in.\nSheldon: You\u2019re blowing it. We want to meet George Lucas and become his friends and play with him.\nVoice: Hello? This speaker\u2019s not working, just pull up.\nLeonard: And that\u2019s how it\u2019s done.\nScene: The same, further inside the ranch. \nSheldon: All right, we\u2019ve defeated the first challenge. Now we must steel ourselves to face the monster who defends the gate.\nLeonard: We\u2019re trying to get past a security guard, not rescue Zelda.\nSheldon: I think what really needs to be rescued is your sense of whimsy, but one quest at a time. So what\u2019s the plan?\nLeonard: Uh, I\u2019m just gonna be honest with the guy.\nSheldon: Honesty will never get us in.\nLeonard: Well, what\u2019s your plan?\nSheldon: All right, my plan is predicated on the assumption that they have a nurse\u2019s office and your willingness to be lightly stabbed.\nSecurity Guard: Who are you here to see?\nLeonard: Uh, I\u2019m just gonna tell you the truth.\nSheldon: Oh, you are killing me.\nLeonard: We don\u2019t have an appointment. We, we\u2019re just fans of Mr. Lucas\u2019s work, and we thought we\u2019d take a shot and see if we could get in and look around.\nSecurity Guard: Sorry, guys, we get this a lot. Can\u2019t let you in.\nSheldon: What if I told you that I was the voice of Yoda? A recording session I must attend.\nLeonard: I\u2019m sorry, don\u2019t listen to him. We\u2019re actually physicists. We\u2019re giving a lecture at Berkeley later today. We just, we had some time to kill.\nSecurity Guard: Hey, listen, you seem like decent guys. I can\u2019t let you in, but I got some hats and T-shirts I can give you.\nLeonard: Thank you so much. See? Maybe honesty is the best\u2026 What are you doing?\nSheldon: Shedding the yoke of my oppressors, you blind, sad little man.\nSecurity Guard: Don\u2019t move. Code A-A-23, A-A-23.\nVoice: Copy.\nSheldon: I can see the ranch, Leonard. Oh, it\u2019s rustic, it\u2019s lovely. I\u2019d take a picture, but people are chasing me. I\u2019m gonna make it. I\u2019m gonna make it. They have Tasers, but they wouldn\u2019t dare use\u2026 Aaaaaaagh!\nScene: Mrs Wolowitz\u2019s house. \nHoward: Come on, Raj. You are the King Kong of Ping-Pong. You are the menace of table tennis. Put her away, \u2019cause I don\u2019t have a third one. Yes. Woo.\nAmy: Rajesh eight, Penny four.\nPenny: Sorry, he\u2019s really good.\nBernadette: Hey, Raj. if Howard can\u2019t keep the TARDIS, how great would it look at your place?\nRaj: What?\nHoward: Yeah, what?\nBernadette: I don\u2019t know much about Doctor Who, but if, um, you were to put this right outside your front door and open up the back, it would be like your entire apartment was the inside of the TARDIS, which is pretty cool \u2019cause on the show, the inside of the TARDIS is bigger than the outside. But then again, I don\u2019t know much about<i> Doctor Who.\nHoward: Don\u2019t listen to her. You and I go way back, we\u2019re like brothers.\nRaj: We are. We are. Oh, no. What a terrible serve. Sorry, brother.\nAmy: Eight-five.\nHoward: This is ridiculous. I want a new champion. Amy, were you serious about being able to serve?\nAmy: Uh, it, it\u2019s been a long time. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m probably pretty rusty.\nPenny: Wow.\nHoward: She\u2019s my champion.\nBernadette: Well, if you can switch champions, so can I. I want Raj.\nPenny: Hey.\nBernadette: Oh, come on, like you even care.\nPenny: I care. Oh, wait, no, I don\u2019t. Good luck, Raj.\nHoward: You know, I thought our friendship meant more to you.\nRaj: So did I.\nScene: An office in Skywalker Ranch. \nSheldon: Do you think they\u2019re gonna call the police?\nLeonard: I don\u2019t know. Maybe they\u2019ll call Imperial Officers to take us to a holding cell on the Death Star.\nSheldon: Oh, I think that\u2019s below the pay grade of an Imperial Officer. Stormtroopers are really the ones who\u2026\nLeonard: Oh, shut up.\nNerdy Guy: He\u2019s right. Uh, Stormtroopers actually combine both the function of infantry and military police.\n\u00a0\nLeonard: Uh-huh, I\u2019m normally very nice, but you shut up, too.\nSheldon: So, what are you in for?\nNerdy Guy: Honestly, I just wanted to meet Mr. Lucas and say thank you. You know, growing up, the movies had such an impact on my life. I never really fit in anywhere. Till I discovered the worlds he created and finally found a place where I belong.\nSheldon: But why are you here?\nNerdy Guy: Oh, I, uh, I hopped a fence, and they caught me in the sculpture gallery making out with a Chewbacca statue.\nSheldon: Excuse me. Leonard, they have a sculpture gallery.\nSecurity Guard: All right, I talked to my supervisor, and we\u2019re gonna let you go with a warning. But if you ever come back, we will call the police and press charges.\nLeonard: We understand. Thank you so much.\nNerdy Guy: Uh, what about me?\nSecurity Guard: No, you\u2019re not going anywhere, kissy face. Let\u2019s go. I have to take your picture to post at the guard gate.\nSheldon: Uh, one question about that picture. Can it be with George Lucas? Ooh, grumpy you are.\nScene: Mrs Wolowitz\u2019s house.\nHoward: Okay, this is the match that decides it all. First to 11 wins. Serve switches every five points. And just so you know, when this started, I was going to put the TARDIS in a discreet corner of the house, but I\u2019ve since turned mean, and now it\u2019s going right in the middle of the living room on a rotating platform with a sign that says suck it. Game on.\nBernadette: Except, Raj is gonna win. Isn\u2019t that right, Raj?\nRaj: Uh, yeah, I mean, her serve was pretty good.\nBernadette: Come on, get in her head. Be intimidating.\nRaj: Okay, uh, I\u2019m gonna own you, bitch.\nPenny: Whoa.\nBernadette: Hey.\nAmy: That\u2019s not nice.\nRaj: Let\u2019s just play.\nHoward: One-zero. Two. Three. Four. Five-nothing. Wait, did you play badminton or sad-minton?\nBernadette: Don\u2019t listen to him, all she\u2019s got is a serve. Now, grab a fresh tampon and put her away.\nRaj: What, and that\u2019s not offensive? Where\u2019s the line?\nPenny: It\u2019s in your purse. Play.\nBernadette: One-five. Two-five. Three-five. Four-five. Five-five.\nHoward: Six. Seven. Eight. Nine. Ten-five.\nBernadette: Six. Seven. Eight. Nine. Ten-ten.\nAmy: Well, that was an exciting 40 seconds.\nHoward: It was, and now the serve is back to you, and the game is over.\nBernadette: You know, Amy, I, uh, can\u2019t help but wonder how Sheldon would react if the TARDIS was at your place.\nHoward: Don\u2019t listen to her, just hit the ball.\nAmy: Keep talking.\nScene: Amy\u2019s apartment. \nBernadette: If this doesn\u2019t get him into your bedroom, nothing will.\nScene: The stairwell.\nSheldon: Are you still mad at me?\nLeonard: Yes, we missed our lecture, we were almost arrested, and you got me locked in a room with a man who forced his tongue down the throat of a stuffed Wookiee.\nSheldon: Boy, some people are just glass-half-empty.\nLeonard: The glass is empty, Sheldon. It\u2019s completely empty. If you gave that glass to a man who was dying of thirst, he would be dead, do you know why?\nSheldon: Before I answer, was he a smoker? I think you\u2019re looking at this all wrong.\nLeonard: Fine, then tell me how I should be looking at it.\nSheldon: Well, not only did we go to Skywalker Ranch, we got in. And no one we know can say that. And for all the times you find me irritating, today you got to watch someone shoot me with a Taser.\nLeonard: That part was pretty good.\nSheldon: See?\nLeonard: You did flop around a lot.\nSheldon: I\u2019ll take your word for it. I was too busy trying not to defecate.\nLeonard: You know, when they were escorting us to the detaining room, I looked through a door, and I\u2019m pretty sure I saw a display case with the Ark of the Covenant.\nSheldon: That\u2019s amazing.\nLeonard: I know.\nSheldon: And I saw Jabba the Hutt riding by on a motorcycle. Although that was right after the Tasing, so who can say for sure?\nLeonard: I guess this could count as an adventure.\nSheldon: It was. And even though we\u2019re not allowed back there, they can never take today away from us. Unlike my sense of smell, which hasn\u2019t returned since the Tasing. No, I got nothing.\nScene: Amy\u2019s bedroom. \nSheldon: Amy, the Daleks are right on my tail, quick, we need to reset the time circuits. Oh, no, I left my sonic screwdriver behind.\nAmy: Really should have thought this through.\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "2_12": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The apartment.\n\u00a0\nHoward: All right, that\u2019s the last servo. Behold the Mobile Omnidirectional Neutralization and Termination Eradicator. Or\u2026\nAll: MONTE.\nHoward: Featuring one articulated razor-sharp killing saw, one polycarbonate grinding and flipping wheel, steel armour plate exoskeleton top and bottom, and enough horsepower to drive a 110 pounds of mechanized death from zero to holy crap in 4.8 seconds.\nSheldon: Is it wrong to say I love our killer robot?\nRaj: As with my father, I both love and fear it.\nHoward: All right, enough chitchat, let\u2019s destroy something.\nTogether (lifting): One, two, three, go.\nRaj: Okay. What shall be first to taste the wrath of Monte?\nLeonard: Maybe we should start small.\nRaj: Okay. Ooh, perhaps today is the day we finally find out what\u2019s inside the Magic Eight Ball.\nSheldon: Did it when I was four. It\u2019s an icosahedral dye floating in tinted blue water.\nRaj: Man, call spoiler alert before you say things like that.\nLeonard: How about the toaster oven?\nSheldon: What did the toaster oven ever do to you?\nLeonard: What did I ever do to Jimmy Mullins in the third grade? He still punched me in the face with my own fists. Sorry, you little nerd, you were just in the wrong boys\u2019 room at the wrong time.\nHoward: Gentlemen, goggles.\nSheldon: Yeah, this is an auspicious moment. Yeah, like Robert Oppenheimer or Neil Armstrong, we need the appropriate words to mark this historic scientific event.\nRaj: How about \u201cDie, toaster, die\u201d?\nLeonard: That\u2019ll do it.\nRaj (after watching complete destruction of toaster oven): All right, what\u2019s next?\nScene: The stairwell.\nPenny: No, I think I\u2019m just going to stay in tonight and do laundry. (Monte bursts through boys door. Penny screams and runs down the stairs.)\n\u00a0\nCredits sequence.\nScene: Outside in stairwell\nHoward: Oh yeah, they still got the full Monte.\nPenny: Leonard?\nLeonard: Uh-huh?\nPenny: What the hell?\nLeonard: Killer robot. We built it.\nPenny: Yeah, well, it almost killed me.\nSheldon: If it wanted to kill you, you\u2019d be dead.\nPenny: So, who exactly does it want to kill?\nSheldon: I\u2019m sorry, are you unaware of the upcoming Southern California Robot Fighting League Round Robin Invitational?\nPenny: You know, since I moved last year, not all my mail has been forwarded.\nHoward: It\u2019s a big deal. There\u2019s an awards banquet and a dance afterward. Perhaps you\u2019d like to come with me. I know the other fellas would be really excited to see a girl there.\nPenny: How is it supposed to be a dance if I\u2019m the only girl?\nHoward: Well, that may be a slight exaggeration. You\u2019d be the only doable girl.\nPenny: You\u2019re a pig, Howard.\nHoward: How is doable anything but a compliment?\nLeonard: Howard, why don\u2019t we just work on the robot?\nHoward: Please, Leonard, not now. Once again, Penny and I have begun our little tango.\nPenny: Our tango?\nHoward: The carnal repartee, the erotic to and fro. But as delicious as the appetizer might be, at some point we will have to succumb and eat the entree while it\u2019s still\u2026 hot.\nLeonard: I\u2019m begging you, stop talking.\nPenny: Look, normally I can just ignore you. I mean, I get it, you\u2019re a little peculiar. You know, like Sheldon.\nSheldon: Yeah, excuse me, Penny, but in this room, you\u2019re the one who\u2019s peculiar.\nPenny: Yeah, you might be right. But back to you. I know you think you\u2019re some sort of smooth-talking ladies\u2019 man, but the truth is, you are just pathetic and creepy.\nHoward: Um, so what are you saying?\nPenny: I am saying it is not a compliment to call me doable. It\u2019s not sexy to stare at my ass and say, \u201cOoh, it must be jelly \u2019cause jam don\u2019t shake like that.\u201d And most important, we are not dancing a tango, we\u2019re not to\u2019ing and fro\u2019ing. Nothing is ever going to happen between us. Ever.\nHoward: Wait a minute. This isn\u2019t flirting, you\u2019re serious.\nPenny: Flirting? You think I\u2019m flirting with you? I am not flirting with you, no woman is ever gonna flirt with you, you\u2019re just gonna grow old and die alone.\nHoward: Thanks for the heads up.\nLeonard: Howard, where you going?\nHoward: I\u2019m going home to live my creepy, pathetic life.\nLeonard: Wow.\nPenny: Well, someone had to say it. (Raj whispers in Leonard\u2019s ear) What?\nLeonard: He said maybe we should enter you in the killer robot competition.\nScene: Howard\u2019s bedroom.\nHoward\u2019s Mother (voice): Howard, the phone is ringing!\nHoward: Here\u2019s a crazy idea, Ma, answer it!\nHoward\u2019s Mother (voice): Hello? All right, hold on. It\u2019s your friend, Leonard! He wants to know why you\u2019re not at school today!\nHoward: I don\u2019t go to school, Ma. I work at a university.\nHoward\u2019s Mother (voice): That\u2019s a school! Now pick up the phone!\nHoward: I don\u2019t want to talk to anybody.\nHoward\u2019s Mother (voice): Should I ask Leonard to bring over your homework?!\nHoward: I don\u2019t have homework. I\u2019m a grown man with a master\u2019s degree in engineering!\nHoward\u2019s Mother (voice): Excuse me, Mr. Fancy-Pants. Want me to get you a Popsicle?\nHoward: Cherry, please!\nHoward\u2019s Mother (voice): I ate the cherry. All that\u2019s left is green.\nHoward: You make me want to kill myself.\nScene: The university cafeteria. Other end of the phone call.\nRaj: What\u2019s going on?\nLeonard: I don\u2019t know, now they\u2019re just yelling about Popsicles. Sounds like Penny really got to him.\nRaj: I\u2019m not surprised. Despite his hard and crusty shell, Howard is a very sensitive man. Do you know he writes poetry? Mostly about men from Nantucket and hermits named Dave, but he does it with real sensitivity.\nKripke (arriving): Hey, Hofstadter. Word around the pwasma wab is you built a wobot?\nLeonard: Yes, we did, Kripke.\nSheldon: His name is Monte.\nKripke: Well, if you have any dewusions about entewing him against my wobot, the Kwipke Kwippler in the Southern California Wobot Fighting League Wound Wobin Invitational, aka the S.C.aw.F.L.aw.aw.I., his name is gonna be Swrap Metal.\nLeonard: Come on, is that really necessary?\nSheldon: Leonard, I believe it is. This is trash talk, and trash talk is a traditional component in all sporting events. Kripke, your robot is inferior and it will be defeated by ours because ours exceeds yours in both design and execution. Also, I\u2019m given to understand that your mother is overweight.\nRaj: Oh, snap.\nSheldon: Now, of course, if that is the result of a glandular condition and not sloth and gluttony, I withdraw that comment.\nRaj: What difference does it make? Fat is fat.\nSheldon: There are boundaries.\nKripke: Tell you what, forget the S.C.aw.F.L.aw.aw.I., let\u2019s settle this woboto a woboto.\nSheldon: What do you mean?\nKripke: There\u2019s no guawantee we\u2019ve gotta go against each other in the Wound Wobin, so let\u2019s thwow down. You know, unless you\u2019re afwaid.\nSheldon: We accept your challenge. Name a time and place.\nKripke: Tomowow, thwee o\u2019clock, the kinetics wab.\nSheldon: Make it so.\nLeonard: No, don\u2019t make it so. Barry, we can\u2019t fight you tomorrow, our engineer is incapacitated.\nKripke: What\u2019s wrong with him?\nRaj: He\u2019s depressed because he\u2019s pathetic and creepy and he can\u2019t get girls.\nKripke: We\u2019re all pathetic and cweepy and can\u2019t get girls, that\u2019s why we fight wobots. If you\u2019re not there, you\u2019ll be exposed to widicule.\nRaj: I\u2019m curious, what part of America is that accent from?\nScene: Outside Penny\u2019s door.\n\u00a0\nPenny: Hey.\nLeonard: Hey, you got a minute?\nPenny: Yeah, come on in. What\u2019s up?\nLeonard: I need you to apologize to How\u2026\nPenny: Get out.\nLeonard: Come on. Wolowitz won\u2019t come out of his house and we need him for a robot battle.\nPenny: Well, then have the robot go and get him.\nLeonard: The robot didn\u2019t hurt his feelings.\nPenny: His feelings needed to be hurt.\nLeonard: He\u2019s been in bed for two days.\nPenny: Yeah, probably with a blow-up doll.\nLeonard: He\u2019s not with a\u2026 does it really matter who or what he\u2019s with? The guy is devastated.\nPenny: Oh, please, how could I possibly devastate Howard?\nLeonard: Okay, don\u2019t take this as a criticism, but you kind of have that overexposed-to-gamma-rays thing going on.\nPenny: What does that mean?\nLeonard: You know, like, most of the time, you\u2019re the easygoing Bruce Banner, but then, when you get angry, you kind of turn into, like, you know, grrrrr!\nPenny: I turn into a bear?\nLeonard: Seriously? Gamma rays? Bruce Banner? You didn\u2019t get The Incredible Hulk from that? Never mind, just, please go talk to him.\nPenny: And say what? That I didn\u2019t mean it, because I meant it.\nLeonard: Well, maybe you can go at it from a different angle, like, um, you see a glimmer of goodness in him and you only said what you said because you want to nurture it and make it shine.\nPenny: Oh, pthththth.\nLeonard: Okay, let\u2019s try it this way. Remember the day that we first met and you asked me to go to your boyfriend\u2019s apartment to get your TV back and he was nine feet tall and he took my pants off and you said\u2026 what was that? What did you say? Oh, yes, you said you owed me one.\nPenny: Okay, come on, that\u2019s not fair.\nLeonard: I came home with no pants.\nPenny: Fine, I\u2019ll go over there tomorrow.\nLeonard: Thank you. I should probably give you a heads up about his mother.\nPenny: What about her?\nLeonard: She\u2019s a delightful woman. You\u2019ll love her.\nScene: Howard\u2019s bedroom.\nHoward\u2019s Mother (voice): Howard, there\u2019s a blonde girl, Patsy, here to see you!\nHoward: Who?\nHoward\u2019s Mother (voice): Okay, now she\u2019s saying it\u2019s Penny.\nHoward: I don\u2019t want to talk to her.\nPenny (entering): Hey.\nHoward: Ma!\nHoward\u2019s Mother (voice): She ran past me. Was I supposed to tackle her?\nPenny: So, I just came by to see how you were doing.\nHoward: I\u2019m fine.\nPenny: Good. Your mom seems nice.\nHoward: People move away from her on the bus. What do you want?\nPenny: Okay, look. Howard, I just want to apologize for some things that I have said. About you. I\u2019ve been informed that you have feelings. And apparently, I have hurt them. So, I\u2019m sorry. Howard.\nHoward: Fine, you\u2019re sorry. Good-bye.\nPenny: So, you\u2019re okay?\nHoward: Hey, I\u2019m a big boy. I\u2019m not traumatized by some random comment from some random woman. I mean, get over yourself.\nPenny: Okay. Well, bye. (Penny leaves room. Sound of Howard crying through door.) So close (goes back in.)\nScene: The apartment. The guys are watching footage on a laptop screen.\n\u00a0\nLeonard: Oh, my God. That\u2019s Kripke\u2019s robot?\nKripke (voice): As you can see, the Kwippler is weducing the Chevy Cavawier to wubble.\nRaj: I can\u2019t watch anymore.\nLeonard: Sheldon, we have to call it off.\nSheldon: We don\u2019t have that option, we\u2019ve accepted the challenge. We can\u2019t run away from a fight.\nLeonard: Oh, please, we\u2019ve spent our whole lives running away from fights. Personally, I can squeeze through a hole in a fence half my size.\nSheldon: Impressive as that may be, Monte is not us. Monte has no fear.\nRaj: Sheldon, did we all not just watch the same video? Kripke\u2019s robot just had angry sex with a mid-sized automobile.\nSheldon: You are overlooking the fact that we now know what we\u2019re up against and we can modify Monte so that he\u2019s prepared.\nLeonard: You want to prepare him? Install a bladder and a pair of shorts so he can wet himself.\nRaj: Excuse me, but how are we going to make any modifications without Wolowitz? Have you heard from Penny yet?\nLeonard: Not yet.\nSheldon: Have faith, gentlemen. We don\u2019t need Wolowitz, engineering is merely the slow younger brother of physics. Watch and learn. Do either of you know how to open the toolbox?\nScene: Howard\u2019s bedroom. \nHoward: And then, when I was 14, I met Marcy Grossman. She was so beautiful. She just got her braces off but they left a little of the overbite. It was so hot, like a sexy little chipmunk. I didn\u2019t have the courage to ask her out, but I dedicated a song to her at the ninth grade talent show.\nPenny: Aw, that sounds sweet.\nHoward: Marcy Grossman is sunshine, on a cloudy day, when it\u2019s cold outside, Marcy Grossman is the month of May\u2026\nPenny: Oh, it\u2019s cute.\nHoward: I guess you\u2019d say, what can make me feel this way, Marcy Grossman, Marcy Grossman, Marcy Grossman, Talkin\u2019 \u2019bout Marcy\u2026\nPenny: That\u2019s great.\nHoward: Grossman.\nPenny: Oh, it\u2019s fun.\nHoward: And then she came up with that sexy little chipmunk mouth and spit in my hair. Which brings us to tenth grade.\nPenny: Howard, do you think maybe sometimes you try too hard?\nHoward: Look at me. What chance do I have if I don\u2019t try too hard?\nPenny: Well, you\u2019d have a terrific chance. I mean, you\u2019re smart, you\u2019re funny, you have a cool job. You build stuff that goes into outer space.\nHoward: I guess.\nPenny: Look, I\u2019m telling you, I\u2019ve known you for, like, a year and a half and this is the first time I feel like I\u2019m talking to a real person. And you know what? I like him, he\u2019s a nice guy.\nHoward: You really think so?\nPenny: Yes.\nHoward: I don\u2019t know.\nPenny: I do. (Howard tries to kiss her. She punches him.)\nScene: The lab. \n\u00a0\nLeonard: Nice little bot you\u2019ve got here.\nKripke: I\u2019m aware.\nLeonard: What\u2019s this do, spin?\nKripke: Yep. At 3400 RPM. It can cut through steel like it was wubber.\nLeonard: Neat. Good work. Sheldon, we\u2019ve got to call this off.\nSheldon: No, Leonard. For years, merciless thugs like Kripke have made my life a series of painful noogies and humiliating wedgies and the insensitively named Indian burns. That stops now.\nRaj: But, Sheldon, we don\u2019t have a chance. The only improvement you were able to make on the robot was to put fresh batteries in the remote.\nSheldon: What you fail to realize is Kripke suffers from a fatal flaw, overconfidence from his robot\u2019s massive size and its overwhelming power.\nRaj: That\u2019s not overconfidence, that\u2019s observation.\nSheldon: Trust me, Kripke will fall easy prey to my psychological warfare. Observe. Kripke! I would ask if your robot is prepared to meet its maker, but as you are its maker, clearly the two of you have met.\nKripke: What is his pwoblem?\nRaj: Way to bust out the Jedi mind tricks, dude.\nLeonard: I just want to make sure that we\u2019re all clear, standard robotic fighting league rules apply.\nKripke: Are you cwazy? This is a stweet fight, the stweet has no rules.\nSheldon: He\u2019s right, Leonard. The paradigm is to the death.\nKripke: I will, however, give you the opportunity to concede my supewiowity now and offer me your wobot as the spoils of war.\nSheldon: Never. I\u2019d rather see Monte dead than in your hands.\nKripke: That could be easily awanged. Weady, set, go?\nSheldon: Do it.\nKripke: Alwight then. Weady. Set. Go.\nRaj: Come on, Sheldon, you got this.\nSheldon: Indeed. We are prepared for anything he can throw at us. (A flame begins to jet out of Kripke\u2019s robot.) That\u2019s new.\nLeonard: Run, Monte, run!\nRaj: Go, Monte! Go Monte!\nLeonard: Go, go, go, go!\nSheldon: Don\u2019t hurt us, don\u2019t hurt us,\nScene: The apartment. Monte is in pieces on the table.\nLeonard: Well, so much for making up for the emotional wounds of childhood.\nSheldon: I did this. Monte was killed by my hubris and my pride. No matter what anybody says, this is my fault.\nRaj: No one\u2019s arguing with you, dude.\nHoward (arriving): I got your text. How bad is\u2026 Oy.\nLeonard: Forget the robot. What happened to you?\nPenny: He slipped and fell.\nHoward: Yes, I slipped and fell. In the bathroom. Bounced right off the tub.\nPenny: Yes, now he knows what bathtubs are capable of doing when you don\u2019t treat them with respect.\nHoward: Yeah. They sucker punch you when your eyes are closed.\nSheldon: So what do you think, Howard? It\u2019s not that bad, right?\nHoward: Oh, no. A little electrical tape, some solder. Are you insane? I\u2019ve seen space probes that crashed into the desert that were in better shape than this.\nSheldon: You\u2019re right. Monte\u2019s gone. We\u2019ll bury him in the morning. A simple ceremony. I\u2019ll speak. Leonard, you\u2019ll play your cello.\nPenny: Sheldon, honey, aren\u2019t you getting a little carried away? I mean, it\u2019s just a toy robot.\nSheldon: Just a toy robot?\nLeonard: Penny.\nPenny: I know, I got it. Sheldon, I\u2019m sorry.\nHoward: Well, don\u2019t get the wrong idea. The way I see it, I\u2019m halfway to pity sex.\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "9_4": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The stairwell.\nSheldon: What a wonderful day, thank you.\nPenny: Oh, we\u2019re glad you had fun.\nSheldon: Blue Icees and a trip to The Container Store? It\u2019s like I died and went to the post-mortem, neuron-induced hallucination commonly mistaken as heaven.\nLeonard: I still don\u2019t understand why you bought that pill caddie. You\u2019re a young man.\nSheldon: Age is a state of mind, Leonard. In here I\u2019m 90. Why are you taking your bins over there?\nLeonard: It\u2019s just where I need them. You know, she doesn\u2019t have a lot of closet space.\nSheldon: What\u2019s wrong with your closet?\nPenny: Uh, well, honey, you know, now that Leonard and I are married, it kind of makes sense that we actually live together.\nSheldon: So that\u2019s all this day was? A plan to butter me up before delivering bad news?\nLeonard: Come on, buddy.\nSheldon: No, I thought we were friends. You asked for a sip of my Icee. If you had your own straw, I might\u2019ve said yes.\nPenny: Sheldon, please, we already feel bad about this.\nSheldon: You know what they don\u2019t sell at The Container Store? Something large enough to contain my disappointment. Although, if anyone did, it would be them.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s house.\nSheldon: Thank you for letting me come speak with you.\nBernadette: Of course.\nSheldon: As my relationships with Penny and Amy are currently strained, I\u2019m turning to you for female comfort and encouragement.\nBernadette: Aw. I\u2019m honoured.\nSheldon: I tried reaching out to my mother, but she was in Bible study. Leonard\u2019s mother is on a book tour. My Mee-Maw was taking a nap, and after a while Siri started repeating her answers.\nBernadette: So, I\u2019m your seventh choice.\nSheldon: Yeah, I know, top ten, pretty exciting.\nBernadette: How can I help you?\nSheldon: Well, in addition to Amy leaving me, Leonard\u2019s moving in with Penny. It\u2019s difficult not to feel abandoned.\nBernadette: Well, why don\u2019t you look at this as an opportunity? You had other roommates before Leonard. Maybe this is a chance to find someone new.\nSheldon: Perhaps I could find someone better than Leonard. Someone I can rub in his face. Chris Pratt\u2019s all the rage right now. I wonder how he\u2019d feel about taking the smaller bedroom.\nStuart: Hey.\nBernadette: Hey. You know who would be the perfect roomie?\nSheldon: Gandalf, but he\u2019s a smoker.\nBernadette: Stuart. He\u2019s been living with us for a while now. I\u2019m sure he\u2019d love to get us out of his hair.\nStuart: Nope, couldn\u2019t be happier.\nBernadette: Well, Sheldon\u2019s looking for a roommate.\nStuart: Nope.\nBernadette: He\u2019ll think about it.\nStuart: No I won\u2019t.\nScene: The comic book store.\nRaj: Have you seen this Archie comic? It\u2019s actually Archie versus Predator.\nHoward: How could Archie defeat Predator?\nRaj: I don\u2019t know. Maybe Jughead\u2019s a Terminator.\nStuart: Hey.\nHoward: Hey, Stuart.\nStuart: Do you guys know any musicians?\nHoward: Why?\nStuart: I was thinking it might be cool to have live music here a few nights a week. You know, give this place more of a staying in business vibe.\nHoward: What kind of music are you thinking of?\nStuart: I like all kinds of music, but my favourite genre is free.\nRaj: Hey, we\u2019ve always talked about playing together.\nHoward: Well, it could be fun to try a little acoustic thing.\nRaj: Oh, we could play filk music.\nStuart: What\u2019s that?\nRaj: It\u2019s been around for years. It\u2019s like folk music, but with a sci-fi/fantasy theme.\nStuart: I like it. It sounds exactly like something I shouldn\u2019t be expected to pay for.\nRaj: Dude, if we do this, we\u2019re gonna need a cool band name.\nHoward: You know, I\u2019ve actually had one I\u2019ve been sitting on for years.\nRaj: Really?\nHoward: It was for this power trio I tried to put together in junior high, but I was short two friends.\nRaj: What is it?\nHoward: Footprints on the Moon.\nRaj: I just got chills.\nHoward: So did I.\nStuart: Me, too. But I, uh, might have Lyme Disease.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Just a few more signatures, and we\u2019ll be finished. Initial here to acknowledge that you\u2019ve returned your key. Okay. As my future neighbour, I\u2019d like you to have a key. Initial here to acknowledge you received it.\nPenny: I\u2019m proud of you. You\u2019re taking this really well.\nSheldon: Well, it\u2019s not like I\u2019m never going to see you two again. Which brings us to article 23 subsection C, please check here to reserve your spot at the ten year roommate reunion.\nLeonard: Do I really have to do that now?\nSheldon: No, but if you want chicken and get stuck with the fish, that\u2019s on you. All right. Oh, and lastly, please initial here to confirm that ownership of the living room couch is hereby transferred to me in perpetuity all throughout the universe and all alternate universes except for those universes where owning a couch is forbidden by the hive queen. In which case, all glory to the hive queen. All right, now all that\u2019s left is for us to sign and date the document, and we will officially no longer be roommates.\nPenny: What\u2019s the matter?\nLeonard: It\u2019s harder than I thought.\nSheldon: Let me help you. L. E. O. N.\nLeonard: That helped.\nScene: Raj\u2019s apartment. \nRaj: So I have an idea for a filk song. It\u2019s kind of a, a power ballad, superhero crossover tale of epic proportions.\nHoward: Is it cold in here, \u2019cause, oh, my.\nRaj: Okay, so it\u2019s a, it\u2019s a David and Goliath story. It\u2019s about man against God. It\u2019s called Hammer and Whip, The Untold Story of Thor versus Indiana Jones.\nHoward: Thor versus Indiana Jones? You just blew my filking mind.\nRaj: Okay, I don\u2019t have it all worked out yet, but I was thinking something like, um, Oh, Indy, oh, Indy, the skies are so windy. Is that a flying man with a killer bod? Wait, that\u2019s no man, it\u2019s a Norse god.\nHoward: Oh yes, definitely. Hang on. Thunder clapped as Thor raised his mighty hammer. Indy rapped, that\u2019s one bad mamma-jamma.\nRaj: That is, that is so good!\nHoward: Right? Mamma-jamma just came to me.\nRaj: Okay, and here\u2019s the hook. Thor and Dr. Jones. Thor and Dr. Jones. One plays with lightning, the other plays with bones.\nTogether: Thor and Dr. Jones. Thor and Dr. Jones. One plays with lightning, the other plays with bones.\nHoward: Oh, man, that rocks.\nRaj: Hey, remember The Ark of the Covenant?\nHoward: Yeah?\nRaj: That\u2019s how much we\u2019re gonna melt people\u2019s faces off.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: I appreciate your interest in the apartment. I just need to ask you a few standard questions.\nBespectacled Man: Sure.\nSheldon: It says here you\u2019re a chemist. Which element on the periodic table do you feel is too big for its britches?\nBespectacled Man: Is that supposed to be a joke?\nSheldon: Looks like argon\u2019s not the only one with an attitude problem.\nFade to another candidate.\nSheldon: In general, would you say that you smell better, worse or the same as you do right now?\nFade to another candidate.\nSheldon: I was going to ask you what is the best fruit, but then I realized what I want to ask you is why is there a Band-Aid on your forearm, but then I realized what I really want to ask you is just can you just go?\nFade to another candidate.\nSheldon: You\u2019re healthy. You have a job in the sciences. I\u2019ve got to say, if this credit report comes back good, you\u2019re the frontrunner.\nAmy (on Skype): I\u2019m not gonna be your roommate, Sheldon.\nSheldon: But I met with 11 people, and they all walked out. And that Hollywood phoney Chris Pratt never tweeted me back.\nAmy: I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll find somebody else.\nSheldon: I suppose. What happened to me, Amy? Years ago I was completely disengaged from my feelings. I\u2019d say it was a happier time, but I was disengaged from my feelings, so who can tell?\nAmy: I don\u2019t know how to help you. You know, feelings are a part of life.\nSheldon: They didn\u2019t used to be. You and Leonard and Penny, you all poisoned me with emotions. I was like the Tin Man, perfectly content until that evil wizard gave him a heart.\nAmy: I don\u2019t think that was the point of the movie.\nSheldon: Fine, then I was like Pinocchio before that jerk Geppetto went and made him a real boy.\nAmy: There you go.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment.\nPenny: So, what are you thinking for dinner?\nLeonard: Well, it\u2019s Thai food night.\nPenny: Well, honey, you don\u2019t live with Sheldon any more. You can have anything you want.\nLeonard: You\u2019re right. But what? Mexican? Italian? German? Indian? Greek? Cuban? Chinese? Pizza? Barbecue? Korean? Korean barbecue?\nPenny: How about Thai food?\nLeonard: Oh, thank God.\nPenny: Hey, we\u2019re going to dinner. You want to come?\nSheldon: Oh, I wish I could, but I realized I\u2019ve become too emotionally vulnerable, so, like an operating system, I\u2019m restoring my life to the last stable version, which was in 2003, the day before I met Leonard.\nLeonard: You heard him, no.\nPenny: Hang on. Wait, you actually think it\u2019s 2003?\nSheldon: No, just because I\u2019m living my life like it was 12 years ago doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m delusional. And since it is 2003, I don\u2019t know who you are, so please exit the premises before I call the police on my stylish new flip phone.\nScene: A Thai restaurant.\nPenny: Are you doing okay?\nLeonard: I guess. I\u2019m just, you know, worried about Sheldon.\nPenny: Well, come on, he\u2019s a grown man in his 30s pretending to be a grown man in his 20s. He\u2019s fine.\nLeonard: I hope so.\nPenny: What else can you do? Move back in with him?\nLeonard: No, of course not. I just feel bad.\nPenny: Well, so do I, but don\u2019t you want to live with your wife and set the thermostat to whatever you want and have your body tell you when it\u2019s time to go to the bathroom, you know, not a schedule slipped underneath your door every morning?\nLeonard: I did like that he had the weather on it.\nPenny: Trust me, this is the right thing.\nLeonard: I know. And it\u2019s not like we\u2019re abandoning him. Plus, we can FaceTime him whenever we want, you know, once iPhones are invented in his universe.\nScene: A bar.\nBernadette: I can\u2019t believe Sheldon asked you to be his roommate.\nAmy: I can\u2019t believe he ran my credit.\nBernadette: Hey, if you\u2019re open to living with someone great, I\u2019ll give you a thousand dollars to take Stuart.\nAmy: You really should\u2019ve gone on the Internet and checked how long that kind of thing lives before you got one.\nBernadette: I\u2019m sorry. I just thought you might have a pasty, weirdo-shaped hole in your life.\nAmy: Hey, I know Sheldon\u2019s quirky, but he\u2019s also brilliant and insightful. I think calling him a weirdo is a little unfair.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Hello, 2003.\nLeonard: Hey, we brought you Thai. Where is everything?\nSheldon: In my present, it\u2019s in the future. In your present, it\u2019s been crammed in the bedroom by an enterprising young man I met in The Home Depot parking lot.\nLeonard: I know what you\u2019re doing. You\u2019re trying to get attention so we\u2019ll feel bad for you, but it\u2019s not happening.\nSheldon: No, what I\u2019m doing is trying to figure out how to live my life now that everyone is leaving me.\nLeonard: Will you knock it off? We\u2019re across the hall.\nSheldon: As the kids are saying today, talk to the hand.\nPenny: They\u2019re not saying that.\nSheldon: They are in 2003.\nPenny: No, no, they\u2019re really not.\nScene: Raj\u2019s apartment.\nRaj (singing): Thor and Dr. Jones. Thor and Dr. Jones. One runs from Loki, the other runs from stones. So, what do you think?\nEmily: Wow.\nRaj: Runs from stones means that, that big boulder, but I couldn\u2019t rhyme anything with boulder.\nEmily: Colder, shoulder, soldier, folder.\nRaj: Right, yeah, right. But, what do you think?\nEmily: I think it\u2019s very cute.\nRaj: Cute? It\u2019s not cute. Cute is children dressed as vegetables.\nEmily: Okay, fine, it\u2019s not cute.\nRaj: Just be honest. You don\u2019t like it.\nEmily: I didn\u2019t say that. I, I just like music you can dance to.\nRaj: You can dance to this. Um, uh, uh, Thor and Dr. Jones. Thor and Dr. Jones. One plays with lightning, the other plays with bones.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s house.\nRaj: I\u2019m telling you, dude, the song has no groove, you can\u2019t dance to it.\nHoward: Who cares? I thought the whole point of Footprints on the Moon was to write songs that make people think.\nRaj: You can do both, like Michael Jackson\u2019s Billie Jean. While you\u2019re dancing you\u2019re thinking, like, darn it, whose baby is it?\nHoward: Where\u2019s this coming from? A few hours ago, we both loved this song.\nRaj: I still love it. I just think there\u2019s room for improvement.\nHoward: You played it for Emily, didn\u2019t you?\nRaj: Yeah, so what?\nHoward: You are such a wimp. She didn\u2019t like it, now you don\u2019t like it.\nRaj: No, no. I\u2019m just evolving as a musician. You\u2019re the one who\u2019s stuck in the past.\nHoward: The past was lunch. You know what\u2019s really happening here? Your girlfriend is breaking up our band.\nRaj: She has nothing to do with this. I am my own man.\nHoward: Oh, please. Your brain belongs to whoever\u2019s willing to sleep with you.\nRaj: That is so not true.\nHoward: Really? Remember when you were gonna get circumcised for Rachel Bernstein?\nRaj: That had nothing to do with Rachel. It was an overreaction to a bad zipper injury.\nHoward: I don\u2019t need this. I\u2019m quitting the band.\nRaj: Fine, I quit, too.\nHoward: Then get out of my house.\nRaj: With pleasure.\nHoward: Raj, wait.\nRaj: What took you so long?\nScene: The apartment. \nLeonard: Buddy, I know me moving in with Penny feels like a big change, but it\u2019s not.\nSheldon: How can you say that? Amy\u2019s gone, and you two are married now, so it\u2019s only a matter of time before you\u2019re gone, too.\nPenny: Okay, you don\u2019t know what\u2019s gonna happen.\nSheldon: No, I do. Eventually you\u2019ll want more space, and you\u2019ll move into a house, and then instead of dinner a couple of times a week, it\u2019ll only be a couple of times a month, and then it\u2019ll only be on special occasions, like when Bernadette divorces Wolowitz. Or, or, or like when Koothrappali\u2019s weird girlfriend admits where she buried his body. Or Amy\u2019s wedding, where she\u2019s marrying someone better than me.\nPenny: Okay, look, we don\u2019t need to rush into anything. All right? Maybe instead of Leonard moving in with me, we just leave things the way they are, and sometimes we\u2019ll sleep over there, and sometimes we\u2019ll sleep over here.\nSheldon: But mostly here.\nPenny: Sure.\nLeonard: Wuh, what about what you said in the restaurant?\nPenny: Well, it\u2019s not forever. It\u2019s just for a while. If you want, we can think of him like he\u2019s our dog.\nSheldon: You can. I\u2019m happy when you come home. And I\u2019m scared of fireworks. By the way, on July Fourth, we\u2019re all sleeping here.\nLeonard: Fine.\nSheldon: All right, great. Just give me one minute, and I\u2019ll get started on a new roommate agreement. Yeah. nothing from Pratt, we\u2019re good.\nScene: The comic book store. \nHoward (singing): Indy\u2019 whip snapped, Thor\u2019s hammer missed.\nRaj (singing): It was Avenger versus archeologist.\nHoward: Indy held his ground, and straightened his fedora.\nRaj: Thor said, that\u2019s a nice look in nineteen fourty-foura.\nTogether: Thor and Dr. Jones.

It\u2019s, like, your third favourite cartoon theme song.\nSheldon: It is, right behind do-do-do-do-do Inspector Gadget., and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, heroes in a half-shell.\nHoward and Raj (together): Turtle power!\nSheldon: However, the Spider-Man lyrics posit that Spider-Man, Spider-Man does whatever a spider can.\nHoward: Yeah, so?\nSheldon: I can think of many things Spider-Man can\u2019t do that a spider can. One, crawl in your ear and die. Two, legally leave Guatemala without a passport. Three, have sex with a spider.\nRaj: an we change the subject? Spiders give me the jeebie-jeebies.\nHoward: It\u2019s heebie-jeebies.\nRaj: I know, but that sounds anti-Semitic. Anyway, I was thinking we could have a little film festival tonight. The theme, movies that killed their franchises.\nLeonard: Oh. Like Jaws 4, Indiana Jones 4, Daredevil 1.\nRaj: Miss Congeniality 2: Armed and Fabulous. I mean, you know a movie\u2019s bad when my homegirl Sandy B can\u2019t save it.\nLeonard: Penny\u2019s working tonight, I\u2019m in.\nHoward: Not me. I\u2019m having dinner with Bernadette and her parents.\nLeonard: Fun. We know how much you love that.\nHoward: It\u2019s torture. Especially with her dad. We have nothing in common.\nSheldon: You know what I like to do when I\u2019m forced to speak with those beneath my intellectual station? I bring up an interesting topic, like the difference between Spider-Man and spiders.\nHoward: Thanks, Sheldon. I\u2019ll try that with my father-in-law.\nSheldon: No, you can\u2019t use that one. That\u2019s mine. Uh, try this one for an ice-breaker. Uh, despite popular lore, there is no place in the continental United States, Alaska or Hawaii from which one can dig straight through the centre of the earth and come up in China.\nHoward: Great, thank you.\nSheldon: Actually, you can\u2019t have that one either. It\u2019s too good. Sorry.\nRaj: What about you, Sheldon? Do you have any plans tonight?\nSheldon: Sadly, yes. Amy\u2019s taking me to a memorial service. It\u2019s for one of her colleagues who is of Asian descent, so my planned conversational gambit is to casually remark that no matter how deep they dig his grave, he\u2019ll never make his way back to China.\nLeonard: That should lighten the mood.\nSheldon: What can I say? I put the fun in funeral.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: Amy\u2019s apartment.\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. Oh, right, funeral. (Knock, knock, knock) (solemnly) Amy.\nAmy: Hello, Sheldon.\nSheldon: I\u2019m not allowed to wear my Silver Surfer neck tie, but you can wear a bathrobe?\nAmy: I think I\u2019m too sick to go to the funeral.\nSheldon: You\u2019re sick? You poor kid. Well, see ya.\nAmy: Sheldon, aren\u2019t you gonna take care of me?\nSheldon: Me? No. No, I\u2019m not that kind of doctor.\nAmy: But our relationship agreement clearly states that when one of us is sick, the other must take care of them.\nSheldon: Oh, no, I see the confusion. No, the intent behind that clause was to force you to take care of me when I\u2019m ill. When you\u2019re feeling better, you\u2019ll think that\u2019s funny.\nAmy: Never mind. Good night, Sheldon.\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. I made a commitment in writing to comfort you in times like this. Additionally, you are my girlfriend, and I care about your well-being.\nAmy: Thank you, Sheldon.\nSheldon: You\u2019re welcome. Now let\u2019s get this over with.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s apartment. \nHoward: So, how have you been?\nMr. Rostenkowski: Fine.\nHoward: Good. Fine is good. How you liking retirement?\nMr. Rostenkowski: It\u2019s fine.\nHoward: I\u2019m sensing a theme. You ever really think about the Spider-Man theme song? How\u2019s that dinner coming?\nBernadette: I just put it in. It\u2019s gonna be a while.\nHoward: I like rare chicken. Let\u2019s do this.\nBernadette: You could die.\nHoward: Death by chicken. That\u2019s a pretty fowl way to go.\nMrs. Rostenkowski: Here\u2019s another beer, honey.\nMr. Rostenkowski: Thank you.\nHoward: So, Mrs. Rostenkowski, you took that trip to the Grand Canyon. How was it?\nMrs. Rostenkowski: It was good.\nHoward: Had no idea you were the chatty one.\nScene: Amy\u2019s apartment.\nSheldon: 102.2. Exactly what it was half an hour ago. It\u2019s like you\u2019re not even trying to get better.\nAmy: Sheldon, you don\u2019t get over the flu in half an hour.\nSheldon: Well, not with that attitude.\nAmy: I have to say, I\u2019m finding your bedside manner a little lacking.\nSheldon: I\u2019m sorry. I just want you to get better as soon as possible. And with that goal in mind, let me ask you a question. Do you believe in the placebo effect?\nAmy: Of course I do. There have been many studies proving its validity.\nSheldon: Great. Now, this may look like a Tic Tac, but it is really a powerful medication specifically designed to cure your illness as well as freshen your breath.\nAmy: Sheldon, this isn\u2019t helping. Why don\u2019t you just let me get some rest.\nSheldon: How can you sleep? I\u2019m not done making you feel better. I still have to put a cold rag on your head, sing to you and apply VapoRub to your chest.\nAmy: You, you want to rub something on my chest?\nSheldon: Yes. All over it.\nAmy: Maybe we should start with that.\nSheldon: Now you\u2019re being a responsible patient. Now, you may notice some tingling.\nAmy: Oh, I\u2019m counting on it.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s apartment.\nHoward: Okay, dig in.\nMr. Rostenkowski: Hold up. Bless us, O Lord for these Thy gifts which we are about to receive from Thy bounty through Christ our Lord. Amen.\nHoward: Took the words right out of my mouth.\nBernadette: So, Dad, have you done any fishing lately?\nMr. Rostenkowski: I\u2019m going next weekend.\nHoward: Oh, you like to fish?\nMr. Rostenkowski: Yes.\nHoward: Sure. I can hear it in your voice.\nMrs. Rostenkowski: Oh, if he didn\u2019t like it, he wouldn\u2019t go.\nHoward: You know, I hadn\u2019t thought of that. (To Bernadette, whispering) Help me.\nBernadette: Hey, Dad, maybe you could take Howard fishing sometime. Give you guys a chance to get to know each other better.\nHoward: No, no. We know each other well enough. He\u2019s been talking my ear off all night.\nBernadette: Howie, I think you\u2019d have fun.\nMr. Rostenkowski: Fine, you can tag along.\nBernadette: Terrific. My two favorite fellas gone fishin\u2019.\nHoward: Well, hang on a second, Bernie. Next weekend, we have that thing.\nBernadette: What thing?\nHoward: You know, the thing.\nBernadette: Oh, that thing. No, I cancelled that thing.\nMr. Rostenkowski: All right, it\u2019s settled. You and I are going fishing.\nHoward: Great. (To Bernadette) Thanks for the help.\nScene: The stairwell.\nHoward: I\u2019ve never even been fishing. This is gonna be a disaster.\nRaj: If you don\u2019t want to look foolish doing something, you should practice. Do you know how many Beef Wellingtons I made by myself before I invited you guys over? I\u2019ll give you a hint. You can see them here, here and here.\nLeonard: Raj is probably right. You should get someone to give you some pointers.\nHoward: Do either of you guys know how to fish?\nLeonard: No.\nRaj: No. But if you catch anything, I know how to steam it in banana leaves.\nHoward: Come on, we must know somebody who can do manly stuff like this.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment.\nPenny: S\u2019up?\nScene: The apartment.\nPenny: Step one, worms.\nHoward: Ew!\nPenny: Okay, right there, ew is one of the things you\u2019re not gonna want to say in front of your father-in-law. It\u2019s right up there with icky and get it away. Now pick one up.\nHoward: Really?\nPenny: You\u2019re gonna have to do it when you\u2019re fishing.\nHoward: Okay.\nPenny: What are you waiting for?\nHoward: I don\u2019t know, for them to die of natural causes.\nPenny: Just pick up a worm and put him on this hook.\nHoward: Fine. There.\nLeonard: I\u2019m no expert, but I think the hook has to go through the worm.\nHoward: Fine. Sorry, Mr. Worm. Sherm. Sherm the Worm.\nPenny: Hey, don\u2019t name him. Just jab a hook in his face.\nRaj: You got this, buddy.\nLeonard: Yeah, come on, Howard. Hook that worm.\nRaj: You can do it.\nPenny: That\u2019s great. Cheerleading, way to man things up.\nScene: Amy\u2019s apartment. \nSheldon (reading): And the control group displayed significantly fewer genetic abnormalities. But, because of flaws in the experimental design relating to environment and diet, they lived inconclusively ever after. The end.\nAmy: That was great. Rub my chest again. (Knock at door) \nSheldon: No. I need to get you down for a nap. And for some reason, that VapoRub gets you all fired up. (Opens door)\nBernadette: How\u2019s the poor thing?\nSheldon: Oh, I\u2019m hanging in there. Thanks for asking.\nBernadette: Okay, Amy, I brought you some drugs we were working on in the lab. This is proving really good for congestion, but there\u2019s a slight chance it can make your tears burn like acid, so if you take it, happy thoughts.\nSheldon: Uh, I\u2019m going to draw you a soothing bath. Where\u2019s your bath thermometer?\nAmy: I don\u2019t have a bath thermometer.\nSheldon: Fine. Then I\u2019m going to draw you a nerve-wracking bath of indeterminate temperature.\nBernadette: This is a really good expectorant. Although some test subjects reported lactating uncontrollably when they heard music.\nAmy: Okay, okay, here\u2019s the deal. I don\u2019t need your medicine. I\u2019m not sick.\nBernadette: I don\u2019t understand.\nAmy: I got better two days ago. It\u2019s just been so nice having Sheldon take care of me.\nBernadette: So you\u2019ve just been lying to him?\nAmy: See the stuff in my nose? Rubber cement.\nBernadette: I don\u2019t mean to be judgy, but this is the kind of thing lunatics do.\nAmy: All right. I\u2019ll tell him.\nSheldon (off): Amy, would you be strong enough to bathe yourself, or do you need my help?\nAmy: I\u2019ll tell him tomorrow. Mama needs a bath.\nScene: The apartment.\nPenny: Now, let\u2019s assume, by some miracle, you actually catch a fish. You\u2019re going to have to know how to gut it. So, what you\u2019re going to do is you\u2019re going to take your knife, slice him right up the belly. (Howard gags) You want me to stop?\nHoward: No, I\u2019m fine. Keep going.\nPenny: All right. Now, you don\u2019t want to cut too deep into its guts, or the blood will just squirt all over your face. (Howard, Leonard and Raj gag) Oh, my God. What is with you guys?\nLeonard: It\u2019s not our fault. Our dads never did anything like this with us.\nPenny: What, never?\nLeonard: My dad was an anthropologist. The only father-son time he spent was with a 2,000-year-old skeleton of an Etruscan boy. I hated that kid.\nRaj: Mine just took me to his gynecology office. I got so bored, I\u2019d put vaginal lubricant on the bottom of my shoes and pretend I was ice-skating.\nHoward: Yeah, well, my quality father-son time was spending my adolescence looking out the window waiting for my dad to come back someday.\nRaj: Yeah, okay, Howard wins.\nLeonard: You know, maybe we didn\u2019t have opportunities like this when we were growing up, but right now, there\u2019s a dad that wants to take you on a fishing trip.\nHoward: You\u2019re right. Oh! I should do this.\nPenny: Great. Here you go. What you\u2019re going to do is you\u2019re going to stick your thumb down its throat, grab the guts and pull.\nHoward: Here we go. Oh!\nPenny: Oh, look, it\u2019s a female. You can see all the eggs. (All the guys gag)\nScene: Amy\u2019s apartment. Amy is dancing to \u201cWalking on Sunshine\u201d. Hears door and turns off stereo.\nAmy: Oh, Sheldon, am I glad you\u2019re back. Taking a turn for the worst. I think I\u2019m going to need another bath.\nSheldon: I\u2019m surprised to hear that. See, the other day, I was concerned that you weren\u2019t recovering, so while you were sleeping, I took a cheek swab and had it cultured in the lab.\nAmy: Oh?\nSheldon: I got the results back. Have you developed any of the following symptoms? A growing nose, or perhaps a warm sensation in the trouser region? Also known as full-blown liar, liar, pants on fire.\nAmy: All right, all right. But I really was sick at the beginning. It\u2019s just been so nice having you take care of me.\nSheldon: It hurts that you would lie to me, Amy. I thought our relationship was based on trust and a mutual admiration that skews in my favour.\nAmy: I feel terrible I did this.\nSheldon: It pains me to say it, but I think some form of penalty is in order, so as to discourage this type of behaviour in the future.\nAmy: I suppose that\u2019s fair. What do you suggest?\nSheldon: In a perfect world, I\u2019d lock you in a stockade in the public square. That probably requires a permit.\nAmy: I could not be allowed to go to the opening of the next Star Trek movie.\nSheldon: Oh, that seems overly harsh. I mean, you gave in to a human weakness, you didn\u2019t kill a man. You know, it\u2019s a tad old-school, but my father was not one to spare the rod when my brother would sneak into his truck and drink his driving whiskey.\nAmy: Are you saying you want to spank me?\nSheldon: I don\u2019t want to. But it looks like you left me no choice.\nAmy: That\u2019s true. I\u2019ve been a very bad girl.\nScene: Bernadette\u2019s parents\u2019 garage. \nHoward: Hi-ho, hi-ho, it\u2019s off to fish we go.\nMr. Rostenkowski: That\u2019s what you\u2019re wearing?\nHoward: No good? The guy at the sporting goods store said these are what fishermen wear.\nMr. Rostenkowski: Maybe in cartoons.\nHoward: Wish I had known that before I posted all those pictures on Facebook.\nMr. Rostenkowski: All right, let\u2019s hit the road. I wouldn\u2019t mind shooting some ducks in the morning.\nHoward: Wait, now we\u2019re shooting things?\nMr. Rostenkowski: I like using a big shell. You can\u2019t eat them afterwards, but it\u2019s fun watching them blow up.\nHoward: Sir, I\u2019m flattered that you invited me, and I really want you to like me, but I don\u2019t think this trip is the way to do it. And I can\u2019t return these things if there\u2019s chunks of duck all over them.\nMr. Rostenkowski: So, why\u2019d you agree to come?\nHoward: \u2018Cause Bernadette made me.\nMr. Rostenkowski: I tried to back out, too. My wife said I had to go.\nHoward: Really? Your wife makes you do stuff? You\u2019re a big, scary cop.\nMr. Rostenkowski: You\u2019re an astronaut, and your wife makes you do things, and she\u2019s only four feet tall.\nHoward: So, what do we do now? They expect us to go away for the weekend.\nMr. Rostenkowski: Ah. There\u2019s an Indian casino near Palm Springs. You know how to shoot craps?\nHoward: No, but I\u2019m not a stranger to dice games. I was the Temple Beth-El Hebrew School Yahtzee champion.\nMr. Rostenkowski: Mazel tov. I\u2019ll teach you how to play.\nHoward: Really? Thank you, sir.\nMr. Rostenkowski: Call me Mike.\nHoward: Okay. Oh, boy, we\u2019re just married to a couple of ballbusters, huh, Mike?\nMr. Rostenkowski: That\u2019s my wife and daughter you\u2019re talking about.\nHoward: Great couple of gals.\nMr. Rostenkowski: I wouldn\u2019t go that far.\nScene: Amy\u2019s apartment. \nSheldon: Are you prepared to receive your punishment?\nAmy: One second. I want to put on some music.\nSheldon: Why?\nAmy: I don\u2019t want to disturb the people next door while you discipline me.\nSheldon: Very well, then. Get over my knee. Let\u2019s begin.\nAmy: Oh, my.\nSheldon: Excuse me. You\u2019re not supposed to be enjoying this.\nAmy: Then maybe you should spank me harder.\nSheldon: Maybe I will.\nAmy: Ooh!\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "7_11": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The apartment.

I cannot walk into that E.R. with another video game injury.\nPenny: Hey, Sheldon, you want to play next?\nSheldon: Oh, I would, but I\u2019m on my way out.\nLeonard: Where?\nSheldon: Texas.\nAmy: Right now? Why?\nLeonard: Is someone sick?\nSheldon: Yes. My sister\u2019s uterus came down with a baby.\nPenny: Oh, she\u2019s pregnant? That\u2019s great. You\u2019re gone an uncle. Uncle Sheldon.\nSheldon: No, I will be Uncle Dr. Cooper.\nAmy: How come you never said she was pregnant?\nSheldon: Well, I never told you about my brother\u2019s kidney stone. You want to hear about everything that comes out of my family\u2019s genitals?\nLeonard: Well, congrats, and it\u2019s nice you\u2019re gonna be there for your sister.\nSheldon: Yes.

Childbirth is a natural, beautiful, uuurgh, it\u2019s like someone sawed a cow in half.\nRaj: My father\u2019s a gynaecologist, I think I can handle it. And, now, I\u2019m gay.\nBernadette: You know, I was thinking. Without Sheldon, most of us would have never met, but Penny would still live across from him. \nAmy: And with Leonard out of the picture, we all know what that would mean.\nPenny: We do?\nFantasy sequence in the Laundry Room.\nPenny: Hey, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Hello.\nPenny: Doing laundry?\nSheldon: Of course I\u2019m doing laundry. Saturday night is laundry night, and I\u2019m in a laundry room, so, I believe your inference is justified.\nPenny: Oh, my inference is justified. Sheldon, you are so funny. Anyway, I need to do my laundry, too, because these clothes are so dirty. Almost as dirty as the dirty girl who\u2019s wearing them.\nEnd fantasy sequence.\nPenny: Okay, that\u2019s enough.\nLeonard: Disagree.\nRaj: Keep going. \nHoward: More.\nFantasy sequence. \nPenny: So, what do you think?\nSheldon: A tad asymmetrical, but nothing to be concerned about.\nPenny: Please, Sheldon. I need you.\nSheldon: To what?\nPenny: To take me.\nSheldon: I\u2019m not taking you anywhere till you put on a shirt.\nPenny: Come on, Sheldon. You and me right here.\nSheldon: Penny, for the thousandth time, I\u2019m saving myself for someone special. Perhaps a cute bespectacled neuroscientist with hair the color of mud. \nPenny: I think I know how to change your mind.\nEnd fantasy sequence.\nLeonard: That\u2019s enough.\nRaj: Ew.\nStuart: I was okay with it.\nAmy (tablet ringing): How\u2019s it going, Sheldon?\nSheldon: Actually, much better.\nLeonard: Oh, good. Is the baby born yet?\nSheldon: I don\u2019t know. I just got back. \nAmy: Where\u2019d you go?\nSheldon: My mother asked me to get some towels. I took advantage of the vague request and went to Bed, Bath & Beyond. (Scream from other room) Excuse me, I\u2019m on the phone. So rude.\nAmy: Here\u2019s another one. Penny, if it weren\u2019t for Sheldon you never would have met comic book legend Stan Lee.\nPenny: Great.\nRaj: At least Leonard, Howard and I would have always been friends.\nBernadette: Hey, how come you three never got an apartment together?\nLeonard: We talked about it, but Howard was in a pretty serious relationship with his mom.\nHoward: I lived with her to save money.\nRaj: Yeah, you didn\u2019t have to buy groceries \u2019cause you were breast-feeding.\nBernadette: Aw, so I guess if it weren\u2019t for me, you\u2019d still be living with her, huh?\nHoward: Not exactly.\nPenny: What do you mean, not exactly?\nHoward: Well, things would be a little different.\nFantasy sequence in Mrs Wolowitz\u2019s house.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Howard, where\u2019s my lunch? I\u2019m starving.\nHoward: I know you\u2019re starving. The neighbours know you\u2019re starving. There\u2019s starving people in Africa who know you\u2019re starving.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): That\u2019s it? There\u2019s not enough food.\nHoward:Well, you cleaned out Earth. I don\u2019t know what else to do.\nBernadette: How is this any different?\nHoward: You didn\u2019t let me finish. Here you go, Mother.\nDead Mrs Wolowitz: You\u2019re a good boy, Howard, such a good boy.\nEnd fantasy sequence.\nAmy: Wait, did she die or did you kill her?\nHoward: Eh, tomato, tomahto. The important thing is she\u2019s dead.\nBernadette: Hey, so how come you two didn\u2019t move in together?\nLeonard: Oh, this guy wanted a place of his own because he was sure he was gonna be a ladies\u2019 man.\nRaj: Yeah, I was wrong. But I do think you and I would have had a great time.\nFantasy scene in Raj\u2019s apartment.\nRaj: Come on, Leonard, dinner.\nFat Leonard: Coming.\nLeonard: Hang on. Why would I be fat?\nRaj: You\u2019d have no girlfriend to see you naked, you\u2019d try to fill the void with food, and I\u2019m an enabler who once deep-fried a pancake.\nLeonard: Why can\u2019t you be fat, too?\nFat Leonard: What do you want to do for dessert?\nFat Raj: I think there\u2019s still half a cake from breakfast.\nFat Leonard: No, there\u2019s not.\nFat Stuart: Hey, guys.\nFat Leonard and Raj: Stuart!\nEnd fantasy sequence.\nRaj: What are you doing?\nStuart: I just wanted to be in anyone\u2019s story.\nRaj: Yeah, but why are you fat?\nStuart: \u2018Cause Leonard was fat.\nPenny: Amy, what about you? What do you think you\u2019d be doing if you never met Sheldon?\nAmy: It\u2019s hard to say, my life would be so different.\nHoward: You can say better. Sheldon can\u2019t hear you.\nAmy: I don\u2019t know.\nFantasy sequence in Amy\u2019s apartment.\nAmy: Happy birthday to me, happy birthday to me, there\u2019s tears in the frosting, happy birthday to me. (Stuart honks a party hooter at her.)\nEnd fantasy sequence.\nStuart: I\u2019ll stop now.\nAmy (tablet ringing): How\u2019s it going, Sheldon?\nSheldon: That\u2019s it. The baby\u2019s here. It\u2019s a boy.\nPenny: Aw.\nAmy: Yay.\nRaj: Congrats.\nSheldon: Oh, thank you. I wasn\u2019t sure I was gonna to make it. But my mother gave me some ice chips, my sister told me to breathe, and I just thought to myself, Sheldon, if you can make it through the Green Lantern movie, you can make it through this.\nLeonard: Well, good for you, buddy. We\u2019ll let you get back in there.\nSheldon: Oh no, no, I\u2019m not going back in there. That baby is so irritating. He has literally been crying his entire life.\nHoward: Aw, he\u2019s already taking after Uncle Shelly.\nAmy: Come on, Sheldon, you should go.\nSheldon: Why?\nAmy: Well, you always complain that you never had an intelligent role model growing up, and now you can be one for your nephew.\nSheldon: Ugh, all right, I\u2019ll go. But from what I\u2019ve seen, his attention span is as limited as his bladder control.\nBernadette: You actually got him to do it.\nRajj: Yeah, you keep saying how much Sheldon has affected all of us, but you\u2019ve clearly had an impact on him.\nAmy: If that were true, I wouldn\u2019t still be living alone. Well, not exactly alone. I do have a 50 pound sack of rice with one of Sheldon\u2019s T-shirts on it.\nLeonard: I\u2019m telling you, Sheldon cares for you more than you think.\nAmy: I wish I could believe you. I also wish there wasn\u2019t a mouse living in Rice Sheldon.\nLeonard: Hang on, I\u2019m gonna give you a little early Christmas present. I\u2019m gonna show you something, but if you ever told Sheldon he\u2019d probably never speak to me again. So, if you want to tell him, that\u2019s fine. Look.\nAmy: I don\u2019t understand.\nLeonard: He made you his screensaver.\nAmy: Oh. Wow. I had no idea. He is so into me. Wait, wait, where\u2019d I go?\nLeonard: Oh, well, it\u2019s you, Swamp Thing, Stephen Hawking, Spider-Man, but, look, you\u2019re in the mix.\nAmy: I am in the mix. And I\u2019m the hottest one.\nPenny: Who\u2019s that?\nLeonard: Oh, Madame Curie.\nAmy: That\u2019s fine, she\u2019s dead.\nScene: The stairwell.\nSheldon: You okay?\nAmy: Just really glad you\u2019re back.\nSheldon: Me, too. I got a lot of TV to catch up on.\nAmy: I missed you.\nSheldon: To quote Han Solo, I know.\nAmy: Did you miss me?\nSheldon: I would\u2019ve preferred to have you there with me.\nAmy: Oh.\nSheldon: Or instead of me.\nAmy: Did you hold the baby?\nSheldon: I did. \nAmy: And? How did it make you feel?\nSheldon: Looking into the blank, innocent eyes of a creature that couldn\u2019t begin to comprehend anything I was saying? Basically just another day at the office.\nFantasy sequence at the Cheesecake Factory.\nFat Leonard: I\u2019m gonna do it. I\u2019m gonna ask her out.\nHoward: And chocolate milk is gonna squirt out of my nipples.\nFat Raj: Put up or shut up. You make it, I\u2019ll drink it.\nPenny: You guys need anything else?\nFat Leonard: Uh, your phone number and one more cheesecake.\nPenny: I\u2019m sorry, I have a boyfriend. In fact, there he is now. Ready to go, sweetheart?\nStuart: Not until I get my kiss.\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "6_20": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The cafeteria.\nLeonard: I was reading about this jellyfish that never dies. Instead, it reverts to its asexual state and then grows up again.\nHoward: We thought my 90-year-old grandfather had reverted to an asexual state, but the lawsuit from his Jamaican caregiver proved us all wrong.\nLeonard: My point is, immortality is not only a possibility, it is real.\nRaj: Only if you\u2019re this jellyfish which periodically reverts to a mass of undifferentiated protoplasm.\nSheldon: If I could keep my Gmail account, I\u2019d be okay with that.\nBarry: \u2013 Hewwo, fewwas.\nAll: Hey.\nBarry: Wemember when we were twying to figuwe out what that smell coming fwom Pwofessor Tupperman\u2019s office was?\nHoward: Yeah?\nBarry: Turns out it was Tupperman.

Now, we can either sit awound and cwy over spilt pwofessor, or we can wejoice in the knowwedge that a tenured position has just opened up. I choose to do the watter.\nSheldon: Excuse me, the whole tenure system is ridiculous. A guaranteed job for life only encourages the faculty to become complacent. If we really want science to advance, people should have chips implanted in their skulls that explode when they say something stupid.\nRaj: Well, I believe people do their best work when they feel safe and secure.\nSheldon: Pchew!\nBarry: If you need my nose, you\u2019ll find it firmwy wodged up the qectum of the tenure committee.\nHoward: You Ph.D\u2019s gonna go suck up like Kripke?\nLeonard: No. I mean, I\u2019ll apply, but I\u2019m not gonna stoop to playing politics.\nRaj: Yeah, me neither. It should be about the work. And if I can\u2019t get tenure, I\u2019d like to see you or Sheldon get it.\nSheldon: Raj, don\u2019t dangle false hope in front of Leonard like that.\nLeonard: Excuse me, but I think I\u2019m just as qualified as you are.\nSheldon: Pchew! Pchew! Pchew!

You know, I\u2019m like the sun. Can\u2019t turn this off.\nAmy: Are Rajesh and Leonard competing for it as well?\nSheldon: Mm-hmm.\nAmy: Do they know they don\u2019t stand a chance \u2019cause you\u2019re so great?\nSheldon: Well put. You know, I must say I go back and forth on this boyfriend-girlfriend thing, but those moments when you worship me really keep you in the running.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s apartment.\nRaj: It would be nice to have the increased income. Stop taking money from my parents.\nHoward: Money from family does come with strings attached.\nRaj: You have no idea. They buy me a new BMW for my birthday but can I get seat warmers? No. Rajesh, if you want a warm butt, you\u2019re gonna have to pay for it yourself. Well, maybe I will, old man.\nBernadette: I think that\u2019s enough wine for now.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment.\nLeonard: I just keep thinking about how cool it would be if I called my mom and told her that I got tenure at Caltech.\nPenny: She\u2019d be proud, huh?\nLeonard: Oh, very. Assuming she takes my call.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: My primary concern with being granted tenure is living with an insanely jealous roommate after the fact. I might need to sleep with a gun under my pillow. Or a chainsaw.\nAmy: Or you take advantage of your newfound economic stability and move out, buy a house, get married. start a family.\nSheldon: Or, the chainsaw.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s apartment.\nRaj: And I will return to New Delhi in triumph atop a bejeweled white elephant. And you know what will be on that elephant\u2019s back? A seat warmer. No, Father, you may not have a ride.\nBernadette: I\u2019m gonna make some coffee.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment.\nPenny: So, who do you have to schmooze to get this deal?\nLeonard: I\u2019m not gonna schmooze anybody. I\u2019m gonna let my work speak for itself.\nPenny: That\u2019s great. That shows a lot of integrity.\nLeonard: Thank you. I\u2019m a naive idiot, right?\nPenny: Oh, good, you heard me.\nScene: The apartment.\nAmy: You know, if you really want tenure, maybe you should cozy up to the people making the decision.\nSheldon: Sheldon Cooper does not do cozy.\nAmy: You don\u2019t say.\nSheldon: But I suppose it wouldn\u2019t hurt to know who\u2019s on the committee. Let\u2019s see. Oh, Janine Davis. Oh, dear.\nAmy: Is that a problem?\nSheldon: Well\u2026\n(Flashback to Series 6, Episode 12, The Egg Salad Equivalency)\nSheldon: Even you. You\u2019re a slave.\nJanine: I\u2019m a what?\n(End of flashback)\nSheldon: I\u2019m not sure, it could go either way.\nScene: The university gymnasium.\nLeonard: Hey-hey-hey-hey-hey. Mrs. Davis.\nJanine: Hey.\nLeonard: Hey.\nJanine: Dr. Hofstadter.\nLeonard: Yeah. Just thought I\u2019d come down and start getting ready for swimsuit season.\nJanine: Good for you.\nLeonard: Not that you need it. I bet you look great in a swimsuit.\nJanine: Thank you.\nLeonard: I\u2019ve got what my father used to call furniture disease. My chest is falling into my drawers. I\u2019m not, uh, familiar with this model. How do I make it start?\nJanine: You push start.\nLeonard: Right. This one might be broken.\nJanine: You have to move.\nLeonard: Got it. Oh. There. Oh, yeah. Yeah, now I\u2019m feeling it. Oh, this is great. I could do this for the rest of my life. Hey, speaking, speaking of things you do for the rest of your life, uh, did I read that you\u2019re on that-that tenure committee?\nJanine: Yep. I got to get a home gym.\nLeonard: Well, I\u2019m sure you have a lot of good applicants, I just wanted to say hi and let you know that I\u2019ll be throwing my hat in the ring.\nJanine: All right, I\u2019ll keep an eye out for that.\nLeonard: Yeah.\nBarry: Hey, Hofstadter. Funny seeing you here for the first time in\u2026 ever.\nLeonard: Go away.\nBarry: Janine the Machine, wet\u2019s do this!\nJanine: Hey, Barry.\nLeonard: Well, look at that. Burned a whole calorie.\nBarry: I guess you got here ewwy to burn off that banana bwead I baked you.\nJanine: Yeah, it was delicious. Thank you.\nBarry: No, my pweasure.\nLeonard: Oh, if you, if you like banana bread, I\u2019ve got a-a great recipe. The trick is in, in fresh ground, I\u2019ll e-mail it to you.\nBarry: Aw wight, I\u2019m warm. Weady to kick it up a notch?\nJanine: Let\u2019s go.\nLeonard: That\u2019s enough cardio for me. I\u2019m just gonna stretch out before I hit the weights.\nJanine: You okay?\nLeonard: Call someone.\nScene: Janine\u2019s office. There is a sound on her computer. It opens up an online video.\nRaj: Good day, Mrs. Davis. This is Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali from the astrophysics department. Don\u2019t be alarmed, I\u2019m not really in space. Anyhoo, I\u2019d like to take this opportunity to tell you about myself, so sit back, relax and enjoy the following 90-minute video.\nJanine: Oh, come on.\nRaj: Born in New Delhi, the third son of an itinerant gynecologist, I showed early signs of genius. At the age of five I discovered a celestial object which later turned out to be the moon.\nShelldon (off): (Knock, knock, knock) Mrs Davis? (Knock, knock, knock) Mrs Davis? (Knock, knock, knock) Mrs Davis?\nJanine: God, they\u2019re everywhere. Come in. Dr. Cooper, how can I help you?\nSheldon: Yes, hello. I\u2019m fine. Um, I understand you may have a bad impression of me, so I bought you a gift.\nJanine: Uh, Dr. Cooper, that\u2019s not necessary.\nSheldon: It\u2019s too late. Get ready to like me.\nJanine: Roots?\nSheldon: The tragic history of slavery in America. Fun for the whole family.\nJanine: Why would you think this is an appropriate gift?\nSheldon: Um\u2026 Well\u2026 You are black, right?\nJanine: This meeting has come to an end.\nSheldon: Because you want to start watching it right now. Copy that. Let\u2019s see. Up next on the tenure committee is Professor Wu. Well, get ready for the complete works of Jackie Chan.\nScene: The cafeteria.\nLeonard: Gentlemen.\nRaj: Where have you been?\nLeonard: Nurse\u2019s office.\nHoward: Asthma attack?\nLeonard: Asthma, heart, some kind of attack. I\u2019m fine, though.\nHoward: You guys going to Professor Tupperman\u2019s memorial?\nRaj: I don\u2019t know.\nLeonard: Probably not.\nSheldon: Barely knew him.\nHoward: Yeah, you wouldn\u2019t want to look like you guys are brown-nosing the tenure committee, who will all be there. Oh, yeah, that\u2019s what I was hoping for, meerkats.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: I won\u2019t be able to make our date night this Thursday, so, bad news for you.\nAmy: Well you better have a good excuse this time, because trimming Q-tips to fit your ears right is obvious nonsense.\nSheldon: First of all, when you say things like that, people think you\u2019re crazy. Second, the reason I\u2019m cancelling is because I have to attend a memorial service for Professor Tupperman.\nAmy: It sounds like a long and tedious evening.\nSheldon: Eh, it will be. Honestly, if I must endure a long and tedious evening, I\u2019d rather it be with you on date night. But I have no choice. The tenure committee\u2019s going to be there.\nAmy: Oh. Well, in that case, perhaps I should come along.\nSheldon: Well, now that I think about it, that would be most helpful.\nAmy: Of course it would. I\u2019m well-versed in academic politics, and as a respected scientist, I can only raise your stock as a candidate.\nSheldon: Actually, I meant you could drive me. But if it makes you happy, that other stuff, too.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment.\nLeonard: Do anything interesting today?\nPenny: Oh, not really. I was out shopping with Amy. She wanted me to help her find something for this memorial thing.\nLeonard: Wait, Sheldon\u2019s going to be there? We all promised we weren\u2019t going to go.\nPenny: Oh, what a jerk.\nLeonard: I know. I was hoping to go without anyone finding out.\nPenny: Well, since Amy\u2019s going, do you want me there? You know, to support you?\nLeonard: Oh, that\u2019s nice, but it-it\u2019s just gonna be a room full of boring old men and I\u2019m not sure how much help you\u2019d be.\nPenny: Okay. I\u2019m just gonna tie my shoe while you think about that.\nLeonard: Oh, yeah. No. Thanks, that would be great help. You realize you might kill some of them.\nPenny: Oh, then you all can get tenure.\nScene: Raj\u2019s apartment.\nRaj: Come on, Daddy. All the other scientists have seat warmers. This is so humiliating. I\u2019ve got to get tenure. Okay, let\u2019s meet halfway. How about I cut my cleaning lady down to twice a week? Looks like we\u2019re both going to be living like animals.\nScene: The memorial.\nAmy: Let\u2019s go over our emotional responses one last time.\nSheldon: Okay.\nAmy: Professor Tupperman is dead, and that makes us?\nSheldon: Sad.\nAmy: The fact that there are so many people here tonight doesn\u2019t make us cranky and claustrophobic. It makes us?\nSheldon: Glad.\nAmy: Giving Mrs. Davis the box set of Roots was?\nSheldon: Bad. However\u2026\nAmy: No.\nSheldon: Fine. Bad.\nRaj: Unbelievable. You have some nerve showing up here just to schmooze with the tenure committee.\nSheldon: You\u2019re here.\nRaj: Excuse me. I\u2019m here to pay my respects to Professor Tupperware, or whatever his name is.\nSheldon: So am I. His passing makes me feel bad.\nLeonard: Well, well, well, Sheldon, fancy meeting you here. I guess the train store in Glendale wasn\u2019t having a cotillion after all. And you, you said you weren\u2019t coming here, either.\nRaj: I have a thick accent. You don\u2019t know what I said.\nAmy: I\u2019d like to know why Penny\u2019s here.\nPenny: I\u2019m here to support my man, just like you.\nSheldon: What are you going to do? Take people\u2019s drink orders and get them wrong?\nLeonard: Do it.\nSheldon: What? Did she do it yet?\nAmy: She plans on flirting with members of the tenure committee to further Leonard\u2019s cause.\nSheldon: Well, that\u2019s a fine how-do-you-do. Don\u2019t just stand there. Take your breasts out.\nHoward: Ooh, meerkat fight!\nAmy: You\u2019re all wasting your time. Sheldon is the most qualified for the job, and no amount of gravity-defying bosom\u2019s going to change that. Seriously, is that tape? Like, how are they staying up like that?\nLeonard: Way to hit \u2019em with both barrels.\nRaj: You two should be ashamed of yourselves. Using women to advance your cause with sexuality, and whatever Amy plans on doing.\nSheldon: Are you implying that my girlfriend has no sexuality to exploit?\nRaj: Yes.\nSheldon: Okay, because that was not clear.\nAmy: Sheldon!\nSheldon: What? That was ambiguous.\nRaj: Well, now it\u2019s biguous. What are you gonna do about it?\nSheldon: Um\u2026\nHoward: You could talk some smack about his mother.\nSheldon: Well, yes, of course, he wouldn\u2019t like that at all. Last night, I was feeling in need of sexual release when I happened to come across your mother.\nLeonard: Okay, okay. Guys, what are we doing here?\nSheldon: I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing, but I was about to insinuate that I had coitus with Raj\u2019s mother for a dollar.\nLeonard: Oh, you do what you want, but I don\u2019t want to lose my friends over tenure. Friends are forever.\nHoward: So is tenure.\nBernadette: Walk.\nLeonard: I\u2019m just gonna go home and let my work speak for itself.\nRaj: You\u2019re right. This is beneath me. Lie your mother was last night.\nLeonard: How about it, Sheldon?\nSheldon: What do you think I should do?\nAmy: Well, you\u2019ll always be an academic success, but I seriously question whether you\u2019ll make any more friends.\nSheldon: I don\u2019t want any more, but let\u2019s go.\nBarry: Are you kidding? I would wove to baby-sit for you.\nJanine: I could not ask you to do that.\nBarry: Nonsense. Childwen wove me. Something about me just makes them waugh and waugh.\nLeonard: No. We cannot lose to that jerk.\nRaj: Yeah, screw it. I\u2019m going in.\nSheldon: Wait. Hold on. I believe screw it, I\u2019m going in is what I said to your mother last night. Don\u2019t worry, I didn\u2019t really say that. I find the concept of coitus ridiculous and off-putting.\nAmy: Should have taken my breasts out while I had the chance.\nScene: Janine\u2019s office.\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Mrs Davis? (Knock, knock, knock) Mrs Davis? (Knock, knock, knock) Mrs Davis? I know you\u2019re in there. I saw your car in the parking lot.\nJanine: What?\nSheldon: I just found out that you recommended myself, Dr. Hofstadter and Dr. Koothrappali to be on the short list for tenure.\nJanine: Well, despite your quirks, the three of you are very accomplished in your respective fields.\nSheldon: I don\u2019t know what you mean by quirks, but, um, I do want to express my gratitude.\nJanine: You didn\u2019t bring another gift, did you?\nSheldon: No, no. No, I learned my lesson. I understand that was inappropriate.\nJanine: Good.\nSheldon: Anyway, thank you.\nJanine: You\u2019re welcome. (Sheldon attempts a jive handshake) I\u2019m gonna pretend that didn\u2019t happen.\nSheldon: Yeah, right on, sister.\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "7_20": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The cafeteria.\nLeonard: I got to tell you, the more I read about the primordial gravity wave discovery, the more excited I get.\nRaj: I know. Being an astrophysicist right now is like being a rock star.\nHoward: Only without the sex.\nRaj: Yeah, literally, none of it.\nLeonard: What do you think about it, Sheldon?\nSheldon: Meh.\nRaj: Are you kidding me? This may be the biggest scientific breakthrough of our lifetime. How can you, as a theoretical physicist, not care about this?\nSheldon: Maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m not an elitist. What I\u2019d like to know is, how does this gravity wave breakthrough help the man on the street? You know? Who\u2019s looking out for Joe six-pack and all his quantum physics concerns?\nLeonard: Oh, my God, you\u2019re jealous.\nSheldon: Why would I be jealous?\nLeonard: Oh, I don\u2019t know. Maybe because the origin of the universe just got proven, the Higgs field just got proven, and you\u2019ve been working on string theory for the last 20 years and you\u2019re no closer to proving it than when you started.\nSheldon: Yeah, well, I\u2019ve had a lot on my plate. We happen to live in a golden age of television.\nBarry: Excuse me, fewwas. Sowwy for eavesdwopping, but there actually was some big stwing theowy news today out of the Hadwon Cowwider.\nSheldon: Really? Did they find evidence to support extra dimensions or supersymmetry?\nBarry: No, but they did find evidence that you\u2019ll bewieve anything.\nSheldon: Why would you do that? You\u2019re a string theorist as well.\nBarry: Incowwect. I am a stwing pwagmatist. I say I\u2019m gonna pwove something that cannot be pwoved, I appwy for gwant money, and then I spend it on wiquor and bwoads. Water.\nSheldon: Do you think he\u2019s right? Am I wasting my life on a theory that can never be proven?\nHoward: Maybe. But how great is Game of Thrones?\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The apartment.\nPenny: Hey, you\u2019re up early.\nSheldon: I couldn\u2019t sleep.\nPenny: I told you those Walking Dead pillowcases were a bad idea.\nSheldon: No, that\u2019s not it.\nPenny: Is something bothering you?\nSheldon: Yes, but you wouldn\u2019t understand.\nPenny: Oh, come on, try me.\nSheldon: All right. I\u2019ve devoted the prime of my life to string theory and its quest for the compactification of extra dimensions. I\u2019ve got nothing to show for it, and I feel like a fool.\nPenny: Okay. I get it. I mean, not all the jibberjabber in the middle, but I know what it\u2019s like to put your heart and soul into something and get nothing out of it.\nSheldon: You mean your acting career?\nPenny: No.\nSheldon: Your relationship with Leonard?\nPenny: No.\nSheldon: Your failed attempt to go back to college?\nPenny: No. I\u2019m saying you and string theory sound like a relationship, and I know what it\u2019s like to be in one and realize it\u2019s never gonna turn out the way you want.\nSheldon: I said Leonard, you said no.\nPenny: I\u2019m talking about other guys.\nSheldon: Okay. Well, what do you do?\nPenny: You have to have the courage to end the relationship. You know? Break it off, shake hands, walk away.\nSheldon: I don\u2019t know if I can do that.\nPenny: I know it\u2019s hard, honey, but in the end, that\u2019s how you grow.\nLeonard: Penny, have you seen my good inhaler?\nSheldon: Break it off, shake hands, walk away.\nScene: The cafeteria.\nLeonard: Hey, how\u2019s dating two women going?\nRaj: Um, kind of hit a bump. When I was honest and told Emily she wasn\u2019t the only person I was seeing, it went great. So I tried the same thing with Lucy.\nHoward: And?\nRaj: She had mixed feelings. But when I said, Emily was cool with it. Emily\u2019s the best. Why can\u2019t you\nbe more like Emily? Those feelings became less mixed.\nLeonard: Women. Who knows what\u2019ll set \u2019em off?\nRaj: At least now I can focus all my energies on just one girl.\nHoward: I hope I get to meet her as soon as possible.\nRaj: Why the rush? She isn\u2019t going anywhere.\nHoward: She is. But I like that attitude.\nSheldon: Gentlemen, is anybody interested in my old string theory books?\nRaj: You\u2019re really going to do this?\nSheldon: I am. Yeah, Penny pointed out that what I\u2019m going through is essentially a breakup. And according to Cosmopolitan magazine, one of the most effective techniques for moving on is to get rid of all reminders of the relationship.\nHoward: You\u2019re reading Cosmo?\nSheldon: Yes. As it turns out, there\u2019s an article on how to get over a breakup in literally every issue. Anyway, it suggests that I set these on fire, but the smell of burning books reminds me of church picnics in East Texas.\nHoward: What\u2019s this?\nSheldon: Oh, that\u2019s just a doodle of a hyperelliptic Riemann surface.\nLeonard: Oh, yeah. Wasn\u2019t that the basis of your postdoc fellowship?\nSheldon: It was. This seemed so elegant at the time, but now I realize I was just a simple country boy seduced by a big city theory with variables in all the right places.\nRaj: It\u2019s going to be okay.\nSheldon: I know. As hard as this is, I have to move on. I can\u2019t keep postulating multidimensional entities and get nothing in return. I have needs, too.\nHoward: So, you and Emily still together?\nScene: Raj\u2019s apartment.\nHoward: I spoke to Bernadette. She\u2019s free tomorrow night.\nRaj: Oh, okay, great. But if we\u2019re really gonna do a double date, then we have to go over some ground rules about Emily.\nHoward: Like when it turns out she\u2019s made of rubber, I don\u2019t say anything?\nRaj: She\u2019s very real.\nHoward: Oh, that\u2019s what it says on the box. Right next to dishwasher safe.\nRaj: See? This is exactly the kind of thing I\u2019m worried about you saying in front of her.\nHoward: I promise I\u2019ll be on my best behaviour.\nRaj: You better be. No jokes about how close I am with my dog. Or the truth about how close I am with my dog.\nHoward: You got it.\nRaj: No jokes about the year I took ballet.\nHoward: You took ballet?\nRaj: God, you never listen.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: Are you sure you want to do this?\nSheldon: The magazine articles suggest that one of the ways to get over a breakup is a new look.\nLeonard: What about your old look, well-groomed ventriloquist doll?\nPenny (treating Sheldon as a ventriloquist doll): Oh my God, I do look like that.\nSheldon: You stop it.\nPenny: So, how do you want me to cut it?\nSheldon: Oh, how about Bill Gates meets Nikola Tesla?\nLeonard: So, business in the front, science in the back.\nPenny: Or I don\u2019t cut it and maybe just style it a little.\nSheldon: Oh, I\u2019m in your hands. Do a good job and I\u2019ll tell you Cosmo\u2019s ten dynamite tips to enjoy your PMS.\nPenny: Can you keep him quiet? Maybe jangle some keys in front of him?\nLeonard: That doesn\u2019t work any more. He just thinks I\u2019m taking him to the doctor. So, now that you\u2019re no longer invested in string theory, what are you gonna pursue?\nSheldon: Oh, there are so many exciting areas. Black holes, dark matter.\nPenny: Oh, Leonard was telling me about dark matter, but I didn\u2019t really understand it.\nSheldon: Don\u2019t feel bad. Neither does he.\nPenny: Okay, what do you think?\nSheldon: Have you ever even seen a picture of Tesla?\nLeonard: It actually looks good, Sheldon.\nPenny: Doesn\u2019t it?\nLeonard: Yeah.\nSheldon: I suppose I could see myself in a scientific boy band. Of course, I\u2019d be the dreamy one and the smart one.\nAmy: Sorry I\u2019m late. What did you do?\nPenny: I gave him a new look. It\u2019s cute, huh?\nAmy: Yeah, it\u2019s cute. That\u2019s the problem. I don\u2019t need other girls to see him walking around like sex on a stick.\nSheldon: She\u2019s right. I\u2019m too hot.\nScene: A restaurant.\nBernadette: I\u2019m excited to meet Emily.\nHoward: Me, too. I just hope he doesn\u2019t blow it.\nBernadette: Why would you say that?\nHoward: Because he\u2019s Raj, that\u2019s his thing. Beckham can bend it, Ralph can wreck it, Raj can blow it. Look, I don\u2019t want it to happen, but odds are he\u2019s gonna find a way to\u2026 Oh, crap, I know that girl.\nBernadette: How?\nHoward: In a bad way, very bad.\nRaj: Hey, guys.\nHoward: Whatever you hear tonight, just remember I love you. Hey.\nRaj: Emily, these are my good friends, Howard and Bernadette. Guys, this is Emily.\nEmily: Nice to meet you.\nBernadette: Hi.\nEmily: Have we met before?\nHoward: Uh, no. I, I don\u2019t, I don\u2019t think so.\nEmily: You sure? You look familiar.\nHoward: Well, you sure don\u2019t. You I know, you I know, you? Total stranger. Even if you had yummy candy, I would not get in your van.\nEmily: Did you go to that spin class on Green Street?\nHoward: That must be it.\nRaj: Since when do you go to spin class?\nHoward: Wow. Now who doesn\u2019t listen?\nScene: The apartment.\nAmy: Sheldon, your food\u2019s getting cold. What are you doing?\nSheldon: Oh, looking through my textbooks for a new field of inquiry. Why do we have a geology book? Leonard, did you throw a children\u2019s party while I was in Texas?\nPenny: Wait. What\u2019s wrong with geology?\nSheldon: Let me put this in a way you\u2019ll understand, Penny. You remember how you explained to me that the Kardashians aren\u2019t real celebrities? Well, geology is the Kardashians of science.\nSheldon: Have you considered studying standard model physics?\nSheldon: You want me to give up string theory for something that\u2019s less advanced? You know, why don\u2019t you break up with Penny and start dating a brown bear?\nPenny: Like you could get a brown bear.\nLeonard: Hey, I\u2019ve got a good job. I could buy salmon. You don\u2019t know.\nAmy: Maybe you could make your new field of study the calculation of nuclear matrix elements.\nSheldon: Oh, please. If I wanted to take up a fad, I\u2019d get a tramp stamp.\nLeonard: What about loop quantum gravity?\nSheldon: Oh, Duchess, look at me. My quantum gravity\u2019s positively loopy.\nPenny: Who\u2019s the duchess?\nLeonard: One of the people that lives in his head.\nAmy: I hope he\u2019s this distraught if he ever breaks up with me.\nLeonard: Well, if he does, I\u2019ll see if my bear has a friend.\nPenny: Sheldon, have you ever considered not rushing into something new? I mean, why don\u2019t you take your time, enjoy your freedom? Maybe something new to study will find you.\nSheldon: That\u2019s actually not bad advice. You know, I didn\u2019t seek out string theory. It just hit me over the head one day.\nAmy: How does that happen?\nSheldon: A bully chased me through the school library and hit me over the head with the biggest book he could find.\nPenny: Okay, how about we toast your newfound freedom?\nSheldon: Ah, normally I refrain from alcohol, but since my cerebral cortex is twiddling its proverbial thumbs, why not soak it in grape juice that\u2019s been predigested by a fungus?\nPenny: And you wonder why other children beat you with books. Cheers!\nScene: The restaurant.\nBernadette: Emily, what do you do?\nEmily: I\u2019m a dermatology resident at Huntington Hospital.\nRaj: Mmm, and you know what that means. Someone\u2019s skin\u2019s about to be softer than ever.\nEmily: This is making me crazy. I know I know you from somewhere.\nRaj: Oh, uh, Howard was an astronaut. Maybe that\u2019s where you saw him.\nEmily: Wow. That\u2019s amazing. What was that like?\nHoward: It was the most incredible experience of my life. Up there in the space station, you\u2019re\u2026\nEmily: Oh, my God, I remember.\nHoward: Can I finish my astronaut story?\nEmily: It was four years ago.\nHoward: Please don\u2019t say it.\nEmily: We were set up on a blind date.\nHoward: Please don\u2019t say it.\nEmily: You came to my apartment.\nHoward: You\u2019re saying it.\nRaj: Wh, what happened?\nBernadette: Yeah, what happened?\nHoward: Okay, I\u2019ll say it. I was on the way to pick her up. My stomach felt a little funny. When I got there, I asked if I could use her bathroom.\nBernadette: Please don\u2019t say it.\nHoward: One roll of toilet paper and 20 minutes later, I was so humiliated, I snuck out the window and never saw her again.\nEmily: You know what else I never saw again, my security deposit.\nHoward: I\u2019m sorry. I tried to unclog it, but you didn\u2019t have a plunger, and water was spilling out everywhere.\nEmily: Right, just water.\nHoward: Look, I have felt terrible about this for years, and I\u2019m glad I have the opportunity to tell you just how sorry I am.\nEmily: It\u2019s fine. All my friends love this story. They call you Clogzilla.\nRaj: Get it? Because you clogged up her bathroom like a radioactive monster!\nHoward: Yeah, yeah, I get it.\nBernadette: Howie.\nHoward: Well, hey, it\u2019s not like cotton candy comes out of you.\nScene: The apartment.\nAmy: Come on, let\u2019s get you to bed. You\u2019ve had a lot to drink.\nSheldon: No more than Penny.\nAmy: That\u2019s what I\u2019m saying.\nSheldon: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. (Knock, knock, knock) Empty room. (Knock, knock, knock) Empty room. (Knock, knock, knock) Empty room. If somebody says come in, I\u2019m gonna freak out.\nScene: The restaurant.\nBernadette: So, Emily, why did you decide to specialize in dermatology?\nEmily: I like cutting people with knives, and all the other jobs where you get to do that are illegal.\nBernadette: You\u2019re kidding, right?\nRaj: She\u2019s scary, but it\u2019s a cute scary.\nHoward: Can I say just one more thing? I had some kind of food poisoning that day. Sure, in retrospect, gas station sushi, maybe not the best choice. Nor was climbing out your window and running away. But I think we can all understand how humiliating that was, and I\u2019d really appreciate it if we could move on.\nBernadette: Howie, we moved on a long time ago.\nHoward: I\u2019m just saying\u2026\nBernadette: We moved on.\nHoward: Okay. Fine.\nBernadette: How\u2019s your soup?\nHoward: Ah, it\u2019s all right. They could\u2019ve filled the bowl a little more. Excuse me.\nBernadette: Where are you going?\nHoward: I need some fresh air.\nEmily: Been there.\nScene: Sheldon, waking up in bed next to a Geology book.\nSheldon: Oh, no. What have I done?\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: How you feeling?\nSheldon: Not so good.\nLeonard: Are you gonna introduce me to your friend?\nSheldon: It\u2019s not my friend. Nothing happened.\nLeonard: I don\u2019t know. I heard you reading pretty loud last night.\nSheldon: Oh, dear Lord. Where\u2019s Amy?\nLeonard: After she put you to bed, she went home.\nSheldon: Oh. I should call her and apologize. Oh, no.\nLeonard: What?\nSheldon: Apparently, I called Stephen Hawking last night.\nScene: Stephen Hawking\u2019s office.\nAnswerphone: First new message.\nSheldon (voice): Hawkman. It\u2019s your old buddy Sheldonoscopy. How come you didn\u2019t pick up the phone? Oh, right. My bad.\nScene: The cafeteria..\nHoward: You\u2019re awful quiet. Everything okay?\nSheldon: Not really. I had a bit of an embarrassing evening.\nHoward: Ugh. Me, too. What happened?\nSheldon: I drank alcohol and may have left an unfortunate voice mail for Stephen Hawking.\nHoward: I wouldn\u2019t worry about it. He\u2019s got a pretty good sense of humour.\nSheldon: Oh, I hope so. What happened to you last night?\nHoward: Oh, well, turns out I\u2019d already met the girl Raj is seeing when I did a number on her bathroom. And that number was two.\nSheldon: Well, you know, I\u2019ve always been a fan of a story told by Attar of Nishapur, about a king who assembled a group of wise men to create a ring that would make him happy when he was sad. And that ring was inscribed with the phrase, this too shall pass.\nBarry: Hey, Cooper. I heard you dwunk-dialed Stephen Hawking last night? Classic.\nHoward: Get out of here, Barry.\nBarry: Whatever you say, Cwogziwwa.\nSheldon: Clogzilla. That\u2019s pretty funny. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s gonna pass.\nScene: Stephen Hawking\u2019s office.\nAnswerphone: Next message.\nSheldon (voice): It\u2019s me again. I gave up string theory. You should give up black holes, and we can totally solve crimes together.\nAnswerphone: Next message.\nSheldon (voice): Do you know what\u2019s great? Geology. Oh. Look at this geode. That\u2019s fun to say. Gee-ode. Gee-ode.\nAnswerphone: Next message.\nSheldon (voice): Gee-ode. Gee-ode. I kiss girls now.\nAnswerphone: Next message.\nSheldon (voice): Hey, guess who I am. Beep bop boop bop. I\u2019m you. Get it?\nAnswerphone: Next message.\nSheldon (voice): Are you mad at me? Oh, no, you\u2019re mad at me. I\u2019m so sorry. Beep bop boop bop.\nAnswerphone: Next message.\nSheldon (voice): Thiospinel sulfide. Thiospinel sulfide. That\u2019s even more fun than gee-ode. Hey, did you see The Lego Movie?\nStephen Hawking: What a jackass.\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "4_23": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The Cheesecake Factory\nPenny: Hey, do me a favour and take table seven.\nBernadette: You mean the one with my one hundred and eighteen-pound rock-hard stud of a fianc\u00e9 who\u2019s prone to canker sores and pinkeye?\nPenny: Nah, I prefer to look at it as the one with my ex-boyfriend and his gorgeous, successful and sophisticated girlfriend, who makes me feel like a toothless Okie.\nBernadette: Do you want me to spill hot soup on her?\nPenny: Oh, please, you\u2019re not that kind of person.\nBernadette: I know. But if she orders something low-fat I\u2019ll totally give her the full-fat version.\nLeonard: Uh, that\u2019s my water.\nSheldon: What?\nLeonard: My water. You\u2019re drinking it.\nSheldon: Dear Lord! Have you been drinking it?\nLeonard: Yes. It\u2019s my water.\nSheldon: Well, that\u2019s it then. I\u2019m dead.\nLeonard: Here we go.\nSheldon: I\u2019m sorry, do I really need to connect the dots for you? The backwash into this glass is every pathogen that calls your mouth home, sweet home. Not to mention the visitors who arrive on the dancing tongue of your subtropical girlfriend.\nRaj: Hey! That\u2019s my sister and my country you\u2019re talking about. Leonard may have defiled one, but I won\u2019t have you talking smack about the other.\nBernadette: You guys ready to order?\nSheldon: Yes, I\u2019d like a seven-day course of penicillin, some, uh, syrup of ipecac, to induce vomiting, and a mint.\nBernadette: I don\u2019t understand.\nHoward: He drank from Leonard\u2019s glass.\nSheldon: He drank from Leonard\u2019s glass. Words they\u2019ll be carving into my tombstone.\nLeonard: That\u2019s actually my napkin.\nSheldon: Oh, this is a nightmare!\nHoward: Where are you going?\nSheldon: To the bar, to sterilize my mouth with alcohol. Gang way! Dead man walking!\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The same. \nBernadette: All right. Here you go. Two lemonades, one iced tea and a root beer for Priya.\nPriya: Is it diet?\nBernadette: That\u2019s what you ordered.\nPriya: Thank you. Hey, have you and Howard started planning your wedding yet?\nBernadette: Yeah. We\u2019re thinking of having it on a cliff overlooking the ocean.\nHoward: Nothing soothes those pre-wedding jitters like the thought of falling and drowning.\nLeonard: What did your mother say when you told her you were getting married?\nBernadette: He hasn\u2019t told her yet. He\u2019s waiting for the right time.\nHoward: I was thinking of weaving it into her eulogy.\nPriya: Howard, you\u2019ve got to tell your mother.\nHoward: Hey, have you told your parents you\u2019re dating this short glass of skim milk here?\nPriya: Uh, that\u2019s different. First of all, we\u2019re not engaged, and second, Indian parents are very protective of their children.\nHoward: Right, right, whereas Jewish mothers take a casual, la-di-da approach to their sons.\nSheldon: I gargled with tequila and may have swallowed a teeny bit.\nLeonard: You all right?\nSheldon: Fine. Thank you for asking. I love you so much.\nScene: The apartment. \nSheldon: Fire demon.\nRaj: Ooh, fire demon. Sheldon\u2019s turning up the heat.\nHoward: Troll master.\nRaj: Check it! Howard pulls one out from under the bridge. Nice!\nLeonard: Water nymph.\nRaj: Oh, yeah, she\u2019s got puddles in all the right places.\nSheldon: Could you please play the game without commenting on every card?\nRaj: Sorry. Walking tree.\nSheldon: Last one.\nRaj: I\u2019m taking a stroll and I\u2019m sporting wood.\nHoward (reading a text): Okay, the Eagle has landed.\nLeonard: What\u2019s going on?\nHoward: Bernadette and my mother are having a get-to-know-you lunch at the Old Town Deli.\nRaj: Oh, that sounds lovely.\nHoward: Hope so. Of course, if history is any indication, my mother will swallow her whole and spit out her bones like an owl.\nLeonard: Have you met Bernadette\u2019s parents?\nHoward: You mean Adolf and Eva? Not yet. One goose step at a time.\nRaj: Sheldon, that\u2019s my water.\nSheldon: Oh, dear Lord!\nLeonard: That\u2019s not your water.\nRaj: I know.\nSheldon: Where\u2019s the mouthwash?\nRaj (holding it): Where indeed.\nScene: Howard\u2019s house. \nHoward: Ma, I\u2019m home! Where are you?\nMrs Wolowitz (off): I\u2019m in the toilet.\nHoward: So, how\u2019d it go?\nMrs Wolowitz: Too soon to say. I\u2019m not done yet.\nHoward: No, I mean lunch, today, with Bernadette.\nMrs Wolowitz: Oh! I had a pastrami sandwich. She had eggplant lasagna. Like that\u2019s what a person orders in a Jewish deli.\nHoward: Besides food, did you get along? Did you talk?\nMrs Wolowitz: Oh, sure. Did you know she\u2019s going to school to become a microbiologist?\nHoward: No, she never mentioned it.\nMrs Wolowitz: I bet she did and you didn\u2019t listen.\nHoward: Yeah, that\u2019s probably it. So, what do you think? Do you like her? She\u2019s great, huh?\nMrs Wolowitz: She\u2019s a lovely girl. Cute as a button.\nHoward: That\u2019s good to hear, \u2019cause I\u2019ve got some news.\nMrs Wolowitz: I hope it\u2019s good news, because I\u2019ve got nothing but disappointment in here!\nHoward: Bernadette and I are getting married. Ma? You too busy bearing down? Ma? (crashing sound from in bathroom) Oh, my God, Ma? Ma? Ma? Stand back, I\u2019m gonna break the door down! (Runs at door. It doesn\u2019t break down. Falls over.) Son of a bitch! Ma, help!\nScene: The laundry room.\nPenny: Hey.\nSheldon: Hello.\nPenny: Haven\u2019t seen you in a while. How\u2019s it going?\nSheldon: Oh, other than waiting out the exponential growth period of the virulent organisms trooping through my microvilli into my circulatory system, hunky-dory. (Penny laughs) Did I say something amusing?\nPenny: I don\u2019t know, maybe, I have no idea what you said.\nSheldon: So your mirth is merely a discharge of nervous energy with no semantic content at all?\nPenny: My mirth. Classic.\nSheldon: Is there a station coming up where I can board your giggling train of thought?\nPenny: It\u2019s not a big deal, Sheldon. It\u2019s just, ever since Leonard\u2019s been dating Raj\u2019s sister, I\u2019ve had to keep my distance. I don\u2019t get to hear all your jibber-jabber.\nSheldon: Jibber-jabber? I don\u2019t jibber-jabber.\nPenny: What are you doing at work these days?\nSheldon: Oh, I\u2019m working on time-dependent backgrounds in string theory, specifically quantum field theory in D-dimensional de Sitter space.\nPenny: Alright, come on, even you have to admit that\u2019s jibber-jabber.\nSheldon: Interesting, do you know where the phrase jibber-jabber comes from?\nPenny: Oh, my God, you\u2019re about to jibber-jabber about jibber-jabber.\nLeonard: Howard and his mother are at the hospital. Come on, we gotta go.\nPenny: Oh, my God! What happened?\nLeonard: I don\u2019t know, I just got a text. Come on, hurry.\nPenny: Okay.\nLeonard: Sheldon, let\u2019s go!\nSheldon: To a hospital? Full of sick people? Oh, I don\u2019t think so.\nPenny: Okay, well, your friend and his mother are there, we\u2019re going.\nSheldon: I can\u2019t.\nPenny: Oh, don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re afraid of germs.\nSheldon: Not all germs. Just the ones that will kill me. It\u2019s the same way I\u2019m not afraid of all steak knives, just the ones that might be plunged in my thorax.\nLeonard: Right, fine. I\u2019ll tell Howard you didn\u2019t come because you\u2019re more concerned about your own well-being than his.\nSheldon: I would think he would know that.\nPenny: Okay, you know what? You are unbelievable. You buy all these superhero T-shirts, but when it\u2019s time for you to step up and do the right thing, you just hide in the laundry room.\nSheldon: Fine, I\u2019ll go. Just for the record, my Aunt Ruth died in a hospital. She went in to visit my Uncle Roger, caught something and bit the dust a week later. The two of them now share a coffee can on my mother\u2019s mantel.\nScene: A hospital waiting room. \nHoward: So I knocked down the bathroom door, picked up my poor unconscious mother, carried her to the car, and drove like a madman to the emergency room.\nBernadette: You\u2019re a real hero, Howard.\nHoward: No, I did what any son would do.\nPenny: Hang on a second, you picked up your mother? Her own legs are barely able to do that.\nHoward: I was filled with adrenaline. It happens to be how women lift cars off babies.\nPenny: Yeah, I\u2019m saying, it\u2019d be easier to lift a car.\nHoward: What can I tell you? After I found the courage to put her pants back on, I was unstoppable.\nLeonard: So, how is she?\nHoward: They\u2019re running tests. I don\u2019t know. It may have been a heart attack or heart-attack-like event.\nPenny: What\u2019s the difference?\nSheldon: A heart-attack-like event is an event that\u2019s like a heart attack.\nPenny: Thanks for clearing that up.\nSheldon: Regardless, coronary problems are eminently treatable. What\u2019s more likely going to kill Howard\u2019s mother are the antibiotic-resistant super-bugs festering in every nook and cranny of this hospital.\nPenny: Okay, you\u2019re not helping.\nSheldon: Disagree.\nLeonard: Go sit over there.\nSheldon: I\u2019ll sit over there, it looks cleaner.\nLeonard: Is there a history of heart disease in your family?\nHoward: My family is the history of heart disease. There\u2019s a cave painting in France of one of my ancestors doing this (clutches chest).\nBernadette: So it\u2019s probably genetic.\nHoward: Well, maybe. Mom also had just gotten some news that might have upset her.\nBernadette: What?\nHoward: It\u2019s not important.\nBernadette: Come on, Howard, I\u2019m going to be your wife. You can share anything with me.\nHoward: You\u2019d think that. But no.\nBernadette: You told her we were going to get married and she had a heart attack?\nHoward: You can\u2019t take that personally.\nPenny: How else is she supposed to take it?\nHoward: What you\u2019ve got to keep in mind is that ever since my dad left, I\u2019ve been the whole world to my mother. I mean, she\u2019d be threatened by any woman who can give me what she can\u2019t.\nBernadette: You mean sexual intercourse?\nHoward: Well, when you say it like that you make it sound creepy.\nPriya (arriving): What happened?\nBernadette: Howard\u2019s mother had a heart attack because I have sex with him and she can\u2019t.\nHoward: Bernie, wait!\nSheldon (to Raj): I\u2019ll give you $1,000 if you\u2019ll drive me home.\nScene: The same, later.\nPriya: Nice of you to come for Howard.\nPenny: Well, he\u2019s my friend. It\u2019s what you do. (Laughs)\nPriya: I\u2019m sorry, did I miss something?\nPenny: It\u2019s just so weird. Howard Wolowitz is my friend. You know, once he tried to stick his tongue down my throat and I broke his nose.\nPriya: That\u2019s a little easier to believe than he\u2019s your friend.\nPenny: Yeah, tell me about it.\nPriya: You know, my brother had a group of friends like this in India. They dressed up in leotards and goggles and called themselves the New Delhi Power Rangers.\nPenny: You mean when he was little.\nPriya: Not as little as you\u2019d want him to be.\nPenny: You know, this stuff is horrible. You want to see if we can find the cafeteria and get real coffee?\nPriya: Sure. We\u2019re going to the cafeteria to get some coffee. You want anything?\nLeonard: I\u2019m fine. That\u2019s nice that they\u2019re getting along.\nRaj: Your girlfriend and your ex-girlfriend are hanging out together? Oh, yeah, that can only be good for you.\nLeonard: What are you talking about?\nRaj: One of them broke up with you. Do you really want her telling the other one why?\nLeonard: I don\u2019t care. I don\u2019t have anything to hide.\nRaj: Good, good. Then you have nothing to worry about.\nLeonard: No, I do not. You are a mean little man.\nRaj: You\u2019d think it\u2019d be because my parents didn\u2019t love me, but actually they loved me a great deal.\nHoward: Bernie, it\u2019s not you. She\u2019s just set in her ways.\nBernadette: How can we be together if the thought of us getting married might kill your mother?\nHoward: It\u2019s the circle of life, sweetie. One day our son will marry someone and it will kill you.\nSheldon: Howard, I have to go to the bathroom and no one will take me home.\nHoward: What\u2019s wrong with the bathroom here?\nSheldon: Pneumococcus, streptococcus, staphylococcus and other assorted coccuses.\nHoward: Sheldon, my mother is on her deathbed and my fianc\u00e9e is grief-stricken over putting her there. I\u2019m not taking you home.\nSheldon: Will you at least go with me to the restroom here, so you can open the door and flush the urinal?\nHoward: No!\nSheldon: This might be a good time to point out, Howard, that friendship requires a certain give and take. Hold the door!\nDoctor: Mr. Wolowitz?\nHoward: Is she okay?\nDoctor: It wasn\u2019t a heart attack. She\u2019s awake, she\u2019s resting comfortably. We\u2019re still running a few tests.\nHoward: Can I see her?\nDoctor: Actually, she said, and I quote, she\u2019d like to see the little Catholic girl first.\nBernadette: Me? Why me?\nHoward: Jews have been asking that for centuries. There\u2019s no real good answer.\nBernadette: Okay, well, wish me luck.\nHoward: Don\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll be fine. Let\u2019s just hide Mr. Cross. If it touches her, it burns.\nDoctor: You brought a Catholic girl home to your mother?\nHoward: Yeah.\nDoctor: Why don\u2019t I write you a prescription for Xanax.\nScene: Outside the hospital washroom. A man enters. 339\nSheldon (exiting while the door is open): Finally. (Goes down corridor. Dodges into a door to avoid a coughing patient on a trolley. The room is full of doctors in hazmat suits.) Oh, what fresh hell is this?\nDoctor: Wait, you can\u2019t leave here, you\u2019ve been exposed.\nSheldon: No, I haven\u2019t. It\u2019s all good.\nScene: A hospital corridor. \nPenny: You want to talk about crazy mothers, Leonard\u2019s mom wouldn\u2019t give him any sort of approval growing up.\nPriya: Oh, the poor thing.\nPenny: It makes him desperate to please women. That\u2019s why the foreplay goes on and on.\nPriya: It does, doesn\u2019t it?\nPenny: It\u2019s like he\u2019s trying to win a prize. A word of advice, don\u2019t doze off. You will never hear the end of it.\nSheldon (through glass door pane): Help me! Come back! Penny!\nScene: The waiting room. \nLeonard: There are a couple of things I did with Penny that might be a little silly, but\u2026\nRaj: Like what?\nLeonard: Every once in a while, before we\u2019d go to bed, I\u2019d put on a little show for her.\nRaj: What do you mean, a show?\nLeonard: Well, you know, the way I took my clothes off.\nRaj: Like, to music?\nLeonard: I\u2019d look pretty stupid if there was no music.\nRaj: So you\u2019d do a striptease?\nLeonard: I wasn\u2019t swinging around a pole.\nRaj: Good, good.\nLeonard: There was one time I put body glitter on.\nRaj: Well, I don\u2019t think you have to worry about Penny telling my sister that.\nLeonard: No, she wouldn\u2019t.\nRaj: Your big problem is me telling her.\nLeonard: You really are a mean little man.\nPriya: Oh, God, that\u2019s so true.\nPenny: Yeah, I know, right?\nLeonard: Hey, what took you guys so long?\nPriya: Oh, we were just chatting.\nLeonard: That\u2019s nice. What about?\nPenny: We were just comparing notes about how you are in the sack.\nLeonard: That\u2019s funny.\nPenny: Yeah.\nRaj: What if she wasn\u2019t kidding?\nLeonard: It doesn\u2019t matter. I\u2019m the king of foreplay.\nHoward: Hey, how\u2019d it go?\nBernadette: You\u2019re a putz. You know what that means?\nHoward: Yeah. Do you?\nBernadette: Your mother just taught it to me. She thinks she got food poisoning from that deli and she just wanted to make sure I was okay.\nHoward: And are you?\nBernadette: No, because I\u2019m engaged to a putz. You let me believe I was the reason she had a heart attack.\nHoward: Well, based on the available evid\u2026\nBernadette: Shut up! She said I\u2019m a wonderful girl and that you\u2019re lucky to have me.\nHoward: Where are you going?\nBermadette (in a voice like Mrs Wolowitz): To the toilet! Is that okay with you?\nHoward: Is it just me, or does she sound sexy when she\u2019s angry?\nScene: A hospital room. The guys except for Sheldon are in Hazmat suits. \nSheldon: Mountain Elf.\nRaj: He takes the elf from off the shelf.\nLeonard: Hell Hounds.\nRaj: Hell Hounds. Who let the Satanic dogs out? Who? Who-who?\nHoward: Colossal Serpent.\nRaj: I got a colossal serpent right here.\nSheldon: Must you?\nRaj: Sorry, I\u2019m just trying to cheer my buddy up. Rotting Zombie. Sheldon\u2019s new Facebook photo.\nSheldon: Zandor, Wizard of the North. Ha! I win.\nHoward: If you skip the part about being under a two-week quarantine because you were exposed to a deadly disease, absolutely.\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "3_23": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: On the roof of the apartment building.\nLeonard: Okay, we\u2019ve got power to the laser.\nSheldon: I should\u2019ve brought an umbrella.\nLeonard: What for? It\u2019s not going to rain.\nSheldon: I know that, but with skin as fair as mine, moon burn is a real possibility.\nHoward: That\u2019s a bazinga, right?\nSheldon: One of my best, don\u2019t you think?\nLeonard: Howard, do you want to double-check the equatorial mount on the laser? We need it locked onto the Sea of Tranquility.\nHoward: You got it. Oh, Raj, no. Billions of dollars have gone into inventing the Internet and filling it with pictures of naked women, so we don\u2019t have to peep through windows.\nRaj: It\u2019s not like that, I\u2019m watching someone\u2019s TV. The Good Wife is on. I tell you, this is my new Grey\u2019s Anatomy.\nSheldon: Leonard, Leonard. What is that? What is that?\nLeonard: Relax, it\u2019s just a dirty sock.\nSheldon: How on earth can you say dirty sock and relax in the same sentence?\nLeonard: Sheldon, the world is filled with dirty discarded socks.\nSheldon: Not my world.\nLeonard: Hey, you know who\u2019d really dig seeing this experiment? Penny.\nSheldon: I wasn\u2019t aware that lunar ranging was her thing. Although, I suppose the retro-reflector left on the moon by Neil Armstrong does qualify as a shiny object.\nRaj: Why don\u2019t you ask her to come up?\nLeonard: I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s still a little weird since, you know\u2026\nHoward: She dumped you?\nLeonard: She didn\u2019t dump me. We were just in different places in the relationship.\nSheldon: I fail to see how a relationship can have the qualities of a geographic location.\nHoward: Oh, it\u2019s very simple. Leonard was living in a little town called please don\u2019t leave me, while Penny had just moved to the island of bye-bye.\nLeonard: Screw you guys. I\u2019m gonna go see if she\u2019s home.\nHoward: If it\u2019s not too much trouble, I\u2019d like to point this at the moon now.\nRaj: Wait a second, the good wife is crying. Something\u2019s very wrong.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: Penny\u2019s door.\nPenny: Oh, hi. What\u2019s going on?\nLeonard: We\u2019re up on the roof bouncing laser beams off the moon.\nPenny: I\u2019m sorry, what?\nLeonard: It\u2019s pretty cool. We\u2019ve got a two-meter parabolic reflector and everything. I thought you might want to see it.\nMan in Penny\u2019s Apartment: That makes no sense.\nPenny: Um\u2026\nMan: How can you bounce stuff off the moon? There\u2019s no gravity.\nPenny: Uh, Leonard, this is Zack. Zack, Leonard.\nZack: Hey.\nLeonard: Oh, sorry, I didn\u2019t know you were busy. Maybe another time.\nPenny: Yeah, maybe.\nZack: Hey, I want to see this laser thing.\nPenny: Oh, but what about the party?\nZack: It\u2019s a surprise party, doesn\u2019t matter when we get there.\nPenny: Oh, right.\nLeonard: Okay, well, yeah, come on up. So, how\u2019d you two guys meet?\nZack: My company designs the menus for the Cheesecake Factory.\nLeonard: Your company?\nZack: Well,, my dad, but me and my sister are VPs.\nLeonard: So, menus.\nZack: I know it sounds easy but there\u2019s a lot of science that goes in designing them.\nScene: The roof.\nHoward: Happy now? I\u2019m moving the dirty sock.\nSheldon: Thank you. Raj, keep an eye out for the other one.\nPenny: Hey, guys, this is my friend Zack.\nZack: Hey.\nSheldon: Hello.\nZack: Whoa! Is that the laser? It\u2019s bitchin\u2019.\nSheldon: Yes. In 1917, when Albert Einstein established the theoretic foundation for the laser in his paper Zur Quantentheorie der Strahlung, his fondest hope was that the resultant device be bitchin\u2019.\nZack: Well, mission accomplished.\nLeonard: Let me explain what we\u2019re doing here. Um, in 1969, the astronauts on Apollo 11 positioned reflectors on the surface of the moon, and we\u2019re going to shoot a laser off one of them and let the light bounce back into this photomultiplier.\nPenny: Oh! That\u2019s very cool.\nZack: One question. How can you be sure it won\u2019t blow up?\nLeonard: The laser?\nZack: The moon.\nSheldon: See, now this is a man for Penny.\nLeonard: Uh, that\u2019s a great question, Zack.\nSheldon: No, it\u2019s not.\nPenny: Sheldon! Play nice.\nSheldon: Well it\u2019s not a great question. How could somebody possibly think we\u2019re going to blow up the moon? That\u2019s a great question.\nLeonard: Don\u2019t worry about the moon. We, we set our laser to stun.\nZack: Smart.\nLeonard: Now, we\u2019ll be able to see the beam when it leaves, but it won\u2019t be strong enough when it comes back to be seen by the naked eye.\nZack: Naked.\nLeonard: Right. Uh yeah, funny. Uh, that device there will measure the photons that return and let us see it on this computer. Raj, get them some glasses.\nZack: Cool, it\u2019s gonna be in 3-D?\nHoward: Preparing to fire laser at the moon.\nSheldon: Make it so.\nHoward: There it is. There\u2019s the spike!\nLeonard: 2.5 seconds for the light to return. That\u2019s the moon! We hit the moon!\nZack: That\u2019s your big experiment? All that for a line on the screen?\nLeonard: Yeah, but, uh, think about what this represents. The fact that we can do this is the only way of definitively proving that there are man-made objects on the moon, put there by a member of a species that only 60 years before had just invented the airplane.\nZack: What species is that?\nSheldon: I was wrong. Penny can do better.\nPenny: Okay, guys, thank you, it\u2019s been fun.\nZack: Yeah, thanks. Should we invite them to the party?\nPenny: No, just keep walking.\nSheldon: He must be very skilled at coitus.\nScene: The apartment. \nRaj: I\u2019m telling you, dude, the only way to feel better about Penny going out with other guys is for you to get back on the whores.\nHoward: Horse.\nRaj: What?\nHoward: The phrase is get back on the horse, not whores.\nRaj: That\u2019s disgusting, dude.\nHoward: No, it\u2019s not\u2026 Never mind. He is right, though. If you want, I can turn you on to this great new dating site I found.\nLeonard: No, thanks.\nHoward: You sure? They say they can find a match for anybody.\nLeonard: Have they found a match for you?\nHoward: Tons. I\u2019ve had, like, eight dates in the last month. And twelve if you count the ones who showed up and left.\nSheldon: I can\u2019t bring the nitrogen tank down.\nLeonard: Why not?\nSheldon: All right, let me restate that. It\u2019s very heavy, and I don\u2019t want to.\nLeonard: I\u2019ll help you.\nSheldon: Thank you. Lift with your knees, not your back. Good night.\nRaj: You know what would be fun? Signing Sheldon up for online dating.\nHoward: Yeah, right.\nRaj: No, think about it. We make it an experiment. Like when Frankenstein\u2019s monster was lonely and he found a wife.\nHoward: He didn\u2019t find a wife. They built him a wife out of dead body parts.\nRaj: Okay, we\u2019ll call that plan B.\nScene: The apartment. It is night and the lights are off. Knocking.\nLeonard: Coming!\nPenny: Damn you, you rat bastard.\nLeonard: Are you drunk?\nPenny: Zack was a perfectly nice guy, and then you ruined him!\nLeonard: How did I ruin him?\nPenny: \u2018Cause in the olden days, I never would\u2019ve known he was so stupid.\nLeonard: Come on, he wasn\u2019t that stupid.\nPenny: Yes, he was! He thought you were gonna blow up the moon!\nLeonard: Okay, yeah, he\u2019s stupid.\nPenny: He spent the entire night bragging about how he invented the word appe-teasers.\nLeonard: How is that my fault?\nPenny: You have destroyed my ability to tolerate idiots. Now, come with me.\nLeonard: Where are we going?\nPenny: We\u2019re gonna have sex.\nLeonard: Why? I mean, okay.\nSheldon: What\u2019s going on?\nPenny: Put on your noise-cancelling headphones, \u2019cause it\u2019s gonna get loud.\nSheldon: Oh! Not this again.\nScene: The next morning.\nSheldon: In what universe is this low-pulp? Good morning, Penny.\nPenny: What, do you have eyes in the back of your head?\nSheldon: When one gets beaten up every other day in school, one of necessity develops a keen sense of hearing. Incidentally, one can get beaten up in school simply by referring to oneself as one. I\u2019m making English muffins. Would you like an English muffin?\nPenny: Oh, thanks, I\u2019m not hungry.\nSheldon: FYI, my noise-cancelling headphones proved ineffective last night.\nPenny: Yeah, sorry about that.\nSheldon: As a native Texan, I must say I\u2019ve never heard the phrase yee-haw used in quite that context.\nPenny: Oh, God.\nSheldon: Oh, God. That I\u2019ve heard on multiple occasions. In what universe is that lightly toasted? This has to be the worst day of my life. Good morning, Leonard.\nLeonard: How many times have I asked you not to do that?\nSheldon: Counting this instance? 317.\nLeonard: Where\u2019s Penny?\nSheldon: She returned to her apartment. I presume to shower and vomit. Not necessarily in that order.\nLeonard: I wonder why she didn\u2019t say good-bye.\nSheldon: Are you expecting me to offer an explanation of human behaviour?\nLeonard: I know. I just thought as an outsider, you might be able to provide a fresh perspective.\nSheldon: I have no difficulty believing you\u2019re not butter.\nScene: Penny\u2019s door.\nLeonard: Oh, hey.\nPenny: Oh, hi. Um, I gotta run. Early shift.\nLeonard: Okay, I\u2019ll walk down with you. So, last night was fun, huh?\nPenny: Yeah, it must have been. I just threw up in my closet.\nLeonard: Bummer. Anyway, I was thinking tonight maybe we could catch a movie.\nPenny: Oh, yeah, tonight\u2019s not great for me.\nLeonard: Doesn\u2019t have to be tonight. I\u2019m free pretty much always.\nPenny: Leonard, last night was a mistake.\nLeonard: When you say mistake, do you mean a fortunate mistake, like the discovery of penicillin?\nPenny: Look, I\u2019m sorry. I was drunk, I was lonely, I hated Zack. Can we just forget it ever happened?\nLeonard: No, it\u2019s pretty well imprinted on my brain. Especially the whole rodeo thing.\nPenny: Oh, God!\nLeonard: So, that\u2019s it? Wham, bam, thank you, Leonard?\nPenny: Look, I said I\u2019m sorry. Can\u2019t u please let it go?\nLeonard: How am I supposed to let it go? You used me for sex! Morning, Mrs. Gunderson.\nMrs Gunderson: Good morning, Leonard. Or should I say yee-haw?\nScene: The apartment. \nRaj: Holy crap.\nHoward: What?\nRaj: We finally have proof that aliens walk among us.\nHoward: Excuse me?\nRaj: The dating site matched a woman with Sheldon.\nHoward: You\u2019re kidding. An actual woman?\nRaj: Yeah, look. Breasts and everything.\nHoward: Trust me, breasts doesn\u2019t necessarily mean woman.\nRaj: Since when?\nHoward: I\u2019ll show you a picture of my Uncle Louie in a bathing suit sometime. Leonard, you gotta see this, we found a match for Sheldon.\nLeonard: Great. Maybe she can have sex with him, and then walk out on him the next morning without so much as a how do you do?\nRaj: Do you know what he\u2019s talking about?\nHoward: Nope. Why don\u2019t you ask him?\nRaj: Leonard, what are you talking about?\nLeonard: I don\u2019t want to talk about it.\nRaj: That was a lousy suggestion.\nHoward: Whatever. Right now, Dr. Sheldon Cooper has to send an e-mail to his perfect match. Greetings, fellow life-form\u2026\nScene: A building corridor.\nLeonard: If she can do it, I can do it. If she can do it, I can do it. If she can do it, I can do it. (Knocks on door) I can\u2019t do it.\nLeslie Winkle: Hello?\nLeonard: Oh, hi. Hey. Hi, Leslie.\nLeslie: Leonard Hofstadter. What\u2019re you doing here?\nLeonard: Uh, I know! It\u2019s been a while!\nLeslie: Yeah, 18 months.\nLeonard: Right. Right. So how you doing?\nLeslie: Fine. You?\nLeonard: Uh, not bad. You remember when we used to have sex and you said that it didn\u2019t mean anything, it was just for fun?\nLeslie: Yeah.\nLeonard: Uh, do you, uh, want to do that again?\nLeslie: What happened? Blondie dumped you?\nLeonard: She didn\u2019t dump me. We were just in different places in the relationship.\nLeslie: Right.\nLeonard: Um, anyway, apparently, it\u2019s okay to go back to people you\u2019re no longer seeing and have recreational sex with them.\nLeslie: Uh-huh.\nLeonard: So, what do you say?\nLeslie: Let me think about it. (Slams door.)\nLeonard: She\u2019s not coming back.\nScene: The apartment. \nRaj: Uh-oh. She wants to meet us.\nHoward: Not us. Him.\nRaj: Yes, but him doesn\u2019t even know about her.\nHoward: Well, him about to find out about her.\nRaj: Really? Us gonna tell him?\nSheldon: Who\u2019s going to tell whom about what?\nHoward: Sheldon. Hey.\nRaj: Hi.\nSheldon: Your surprise confuses me. I live here.\nHoward: Right. So, listen, what are you doing tomorrow afternoon?\nSheldon: Be more specific.\nHoward: Four thirty.\nSheldon: That\u2019s not afternoon. That\u2019s preevning.\nHoward: What?\nSheldon: It\u2019s a time of day I invented. It better defines the ambiguous period between afternoon and evening. Preevning. I\u2019m fairly certain it will catch on as it fills a desperate need.\nRaj: Right, okay. What are you doing tomorrow preevning?\nSheldon: Well, tomorrow\u2019s Saturday. Saturday night is laundry night, so I\u2019ll be spending the preevning pre-sorting and pre-soaking.\nHoward: Okay, what if I were to tell you, tomorrow, at 4:30 you could meet a woman who has been scientifically chosen to be your perfect mate?\nSheldon: I would snort in derision and throw my arms in the air, exhausted by your constant tomfoolery.\nRaj: But it\u2019s true. But we-we put all your vital information into this dating site, answered all their questions just like you would, and they found a match for you. Her name is Amy Farrah Fowler.\nSheldon: Please. Even assuming you could answer any question the way I would, the algorithms used by matchmaking sites are complete hokum.\nHoward: And that\u2019s exactly the answer we gave to the question, what is your attitude towards online dating\u201d\nRaj: Howard wanted to write mumbo jumbo, but I said no, our Sheldon would say hokum.\nHoward: Well, come on, where\u2019s your scientific curiosity?\nSheldon: Well, most of it is being applied to unravelling the secrets of the universe while the rest of it\u2019s wondering why I\u2019m having this conversation with you.\nRaj: Okay, how about this. Even Spock had a date once every seven years.\nSheldon: He didn\u2019t date. It was pon farr. His blood boiled with mating lust.\nHoward: Okay, well, why don\u2019t you start with a cup of coffee, and you can pon farr Amy Farrah Fowler later.\nSheldon: I don\u2019t drink coffee.\nHoward: All right, you can have a hot chocolate.\nSheldon: As I will not be engaging in this nonsense, my choice of beverage is moot. But for the record, I only drink hot chocolate in months with an R in them.\nHoward: Why?\nSheldon: What\u2019s life without whimsy?\nHoward: Okay, I\u2019m out.\nRaj: Sheldon, I\u2019ve hidden the dirty sock from the roof somewhere in your apartment. Unless you are willing to come with us to meet this girl, it will remain there forever.\nSheldon: You\u2019re bluffing.\nRaj: Are you willing to risk it?\nSheldon: Curse you.\nScene: The hallway. Leonard is finishing off a bottle of spirits. He opens the lift and drops the bottle inside.\nLeonard: Thirty feet.\nPenny: Oh. Hey, Leonard.\nLeonard: I was a perfectly happy, geeky, little lonely guy, and you ruined me!\nPenny: Are you drunk?\nLeonard: Come on. We\u2019re gonna have sex, and it\u2019s not gonna mean a thing!\nPenny: Are you out of your mind?!\nLeonard: I\u2019m really starting to think there\u2019s a double standard here.\nScene: A coffee shop.\nSheldon: In a few minutes, when I gloat over the failure of this enterprise, how would you prefer I do it? The standard I told you so? The classic neener-neener? Or just my normal look of haughty derision?\nRaj: You don\u2019t know we\u2019re wrong yet.\nSheldon: Haughty derision it is.\nAmy: Excuse me. I\u2019m Amy Farrah Fowler. You\u2019re Sheldon Cooper.\nSheldon: Hello, Amy Farrah Fowler. I\u2019m sorry to inform you that you have been taken in by unsupportable mathematics designed to prey on the gullible and the lonely. Additionally, I\u2019m being blackmailed with a hidden dirty sock.\nAmy: If that was slang, I\u2019m unfamiliar with it. If it was literal, I share your aversion to soiled hosiery. In any case, I\u2019m here because my mother and I have agreed that I will date at least once a year.\nSheldon: Interesting. My mother and I have the same agreement about church.\nAmy: I don\u2019t object to the concept of a deity, but I\u2019m baffled by the notion of one that takes attendance.\nSheldon: Well, then you might want to avoid East Texas.\nAmy: Noted. Now, before this goes any further, you should know that all forms of physical contact up to and including coitus are off the table.\nSheldon: May I buy you a beverage?\nAmy: Tepid water, please.\nHoward: Good God, what have we done?\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "3_16": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The comic book store.

He dances.)\nHoward: I\u2019m sad to say I taught him those moves.\nCredits sequence.\n \nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: I can\u2019t decide whether I want Stan Lee to autograph my Journey into Mystery 83, first appearance of Thor or my Fantastic Four number five, first appearance of Dr. Doom. (Raj presses his iPod. The theme from Jeopardy plays.) Alex, I\u2019m going to go with what is\u2026 you\u2019re a dumbass? (Presses again, his shirt blows a raspberry.)\nSheldon: I\u2019ve decided I\u2019m going to have Mr. Lee sign my copy of this month\u2019s Batman.\nHoward: That\u2019s crazy. Stan Lee had nothing to do with Batman.\nSheldon: Yes, which is why no one else will ask him to sign one, and I will be the possessor of a unique, albeit confusing, artifact, which will set me apart from the hoi polloi of comic book fandom.\nRaj: That\u2019s a great idea, I\u2019m going to get him to sign a Batman as well.\nSheldon: What is it about the word unique you don\u2019t understand?\nHoward: Ow! Damn, paper cut. Nothing worse than a paper cut.\nRaj: Well, obviously you don\u2019t remember your circumcision.\nSheldon: There\u2019s Neosporin and Band-Aids in my top desk drawer.\nHoward: Why don\u2019t you keep that stuff in the bathroom?\nLeonard: He does. And in the kitchen. And in the car. And in his pocket.\nSheldon: Yeah, but the ones in my pocket are mine.\nPenny: Hi!\nLeonard: Hey. Guess who\u2019s going to be at the comic bookstore on Thursday?\nPenny: Um, can you give me a hint?\nLeonard: Stan Lee.\nPenny: Um, Stanley, Stanley, Stanley Tucci?\nLeonard: No, no, Stan Lee.\nPenny: Oh, oh, Stan Lee! Cool!\nLeonard: You have no idea who he is, do you?\nPenny: Of course I do. You\u2019re an important part of my life and I pay attention to the things you are interested in.\nLeonard: Good, good, so, who\u2019s Stan Lee?\nPenny: Um, he was on Star Trek.\nLeonard: Nope.\nPenny: Star Wars?\nLeonard: No.\nPenny: Um, uh, Stan Lee, oh, he was in those goofy kung fu movies you love so much?\nLeonard: That\u2019s Bruce Lee.\nPenny: Oh. So, is this Bruce Lee\u2019s nerdy brother, Stan?\nHoward: Sheldon, why do you have all these unopened paychecks in your desk?\nSheldon: Because most of the things I\u2019m planning to buy haven\u2019t been invented yet.\nHoward: But there must be thousands of dollars here. Why don\u2019t you put it in the bank?\nSheldon: I don\u2019t trust banks. I believe that when the robots rise up, ATMs will lead the charge.\nHoward: You\u2019ve also got something from the Pasadena Municipal Court.\nSheldon: Undoubtedly yet another snide response to my repeated letters complaining that the flags in front of the courthouse are flying in the wrong order. From left to right, it\u2019s supposed to be federal, state, and then city of Pasadena.\nPenny: I\u2019m sorry. You sent more than one letter about that?\nSheldon: It bothers me.\nHoward: Sheldon, this is a summons.\nSheldon: A summons for what?\nHoward: Looks like you ran a red light on Marengo Avenue at 9:30 p.m. on November 16. They got you on a traffic camera. Nice picture.\nSheldon: November 16? Penny, that\u2019s the evening you fell in your bathtub and I had to drive you to the emergency room.\nPenny: No, it isn\u2019t.\nSheldon: Yes, it is.\nPenny: No, it isn\u2019t.\nSheldon: Penny, I have an eidetic memory. Also, that\u2019s a picture of you in the passenger seat holding your dislocated shoulder.\nPenny: Mmm, no, it isn\u2019t.\nSheldon: Okay, then why is a summons for a traffic violation committed in your car, bearing your license plates, coming to me?\nPenny: Okay, look, they sent me the ticket. I told them I wasn\u2019t driving and they were all, if it wasn\u2019t you, who was it?\nSheldon: So you betrayed me?\nPenny: No! It wasn\u2019t a betrayal. It was more of a can\u2019t afford any more points on my license. I already have to buy my insurance from this place in the Cayman Islands.\nSheldon: But the only reason I was driving your car was because you were in distress and I was rescuing you.\nPenny: Yes, yes, look, and now you have a photo to remember that heroic day.\nLeonard: It\u2019s not that big a deal. You just go down to the court on Thursday and you pay the fine.\nSheldon: I\u2019m not going to pay a fine. That would imply I\u2019m guilty.\nHoward: You are guilty. (Raj\u2019s shirt plays the gavel sound from Law & Order) That one I liked.\nSheldon: I am not guilty. I only have a learner\u2019s permit, Penny was the teacher. When the light turned yellow she said go, go, go, so I went, went, went.\nPenny: Sheldon, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ll be happy to reimburse you for the fine. You know, as soon as I get a part in a movie or my own TV series.\nSheldon: You don\u2019t need to reimburse me because I\u2019m not paying. On Thursday, I will have my day in court and justice will be done. In fact, I\u2019m going to begin preparing my defence right now.\nHoward: Okay, he\u2019s going to jail.\nLeonard (after Raj whispers to him): Oh, that\u2019s right. Thursday is Stan Lee Day.\nSheldon: Now you see what you\u2019ve done? Because of you, we\u2019re all going to miss Stan Lee.\nLeonard: Whoa! What do you mean all?\nSheldon: Well, you\u2019re my friends. You\u2019ll be standing by my side, supporting me, feeding me legal precedents, and if you had the upper body strength, carrying me out on your shoulders when I\u2019m victorious.\nLeonard: Yeah, okay. No.\nSheldon: Are you saying that you will not stand beside me as I plead my case?\nLeonard: That\u2019s what I\u2019m saying.\nSheldon: Howard?\nHoward: Wow. Uh, Stan Lee, or you in court? Uh, if this was Sophie\u2019s Choice it would\u2019ve been a much shorter movie. No.\nSheldon: Raj? You\u2019ll be there, won\u2019t you? (Shirt plays \u201cincorrect\u201d quiz sound) All right, then, my so-called friends have forsaken me. So, I guess it\u2019ll just be me and my eyewitness.\nPenny: Oh, balls.\nSheldon: Please try to wear something appropriate. It won\u2019t help my case if the judge is busy trying to read the word Juicy scrawled across your buttocks.\nScene: Penny\u2019s door. \nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny.\nPenny (opening door): (Knock, knock, knock) Penny.\nSheldon: That\u2019s just wrong.\nPenny: All right, let\u2019s go.\nSheldon: Wait, hold on. Before we get to the courthouse, I\u2019d like to call on your skills as an actress.\nPenny: What is this?\nSheldon: I\u2019ve taken the liberty of scripting your appearance on the witness stand because, let\u2019s face it, you\u2019re somewhat of a loose cannon. Now, don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s written in your vernacular. So shall we rehearse?\nPenny: Do I have a choice?\nSheldon: Well, of course you have a choice. Although we live in a deterministic universe, each individual has free will. Now, sit down. I call your attention to the events of November 16. Do you remember that date?\nPenny (reading): Darn tootin\u2019, I do, if the court will excuse my homespun, corn-fed Nebraskan turn of phrase.\nSheldon: Excellent. Go on.\nPenny: The reason that date is, like, so totally fixed in my memory is that I had the privilege to be witness to one of the most heroic acts I\u2019ve ever seen in, like, ever.\nSheldon: And who performed that heroic act?\nPenny: Why, you did, sir. You. Dr. Sheldon Cooper, and may I add, it is a privilege to know you.\nSheldon: There\u2019s no need for compliments, this court is only interested in the facts.\nPenny: But it is a fact that it\u2019s a privilege to know you. Totally. A teardrop rolls down my cheek?\nSheldon: Only a suggestion. A catch in your throat would work just as well.\nPenny (pretending to be close to tears): But it is a fact that it\u2019s a privilege to know you. Totally.\nSheldon: Maybe you should put on your Juicy pants again.\nScene: The courtroom. \nJudge: Pay the cashier. Sheldon Cooper?\nSheldon: Good morning, Your Honour. Dr. Sheldon Cooper appearing in pro se. That is to say, representing himself.\nJudge: I know what it means. I went to law school.\nSheldon: And yet you wound up in traffic court. Anyway, if it would please the court, I\u2019d like to begin with an opening statement.\nJudge: The court would advise you to make it quick, as the court had a dicey-looking breakfast burrito this morning and just took an Imodium.\nSheldon: Very well, a quick opening statement. Like a milking stool, my case rests on three legs. I will demonstrate that I was improperly instructed in driving by a woman whose lack of respect for society borders on the sociopathic. I will argue that the emergency met the legal doctrine of quod est necessarium est licitum, that which is necessary is legal. But first, I will raise a Sixth Amendment issue. I\u2019m unable to confront my accuser, a non-human entity, to wit, a camera. So, to sum up, improper instruction, quod est necessarium est licitum, Sixth Amendment. My milk stool is complete.\nJudge: Impressive.\nSheldon: Thank you.\nJudge: Guilty. Pay the cashier.\nSheldon: I object. You\u2019re completely ignoring the law.\nJudge: No, I\u2019m following the law. I\u2019m ignoring you.\nSheldon: Really? I would point out that I am at the top of my profession, while you preside over the kiddy table of yours.\nJudge: Dr. Cooper, before I find you in contempt and throw you in jail, I\u2019m going to give you a chance to apologize for that last remark.\nSheldon: I am a scientist. I never apologize for the truth.\nScene: A police cell. Three people sit on a bench inside. Sheldon points at the one on the end.\nSheldon: That\u2019s my spot.\nScene: A queue outside the comic book store.\nRaj: I can\u2019t wait to ask Stan Lee why he insists on giving all his characters first and last names that start with the same letter.\nLeonard: Oh, come on, why would you do that?\nRaj: Bruce Banner, Reed Richards, Sue Storm, Stephen Strange, Otto Octavius, Silver Surfer, Peter Parker, oh, and worst of all, J. Jonah Jameson, Jr.\nHoward: Okay, I\u2019m cutting. I\u2019m not gonna talk to Stan Lee after you cheese him off.\nLeonard (phone rings.): Hey.\nPenny: Sheldon\u2019s in jail.\nLeonard: Sheldon\u2019s in jail?\nRaj: You called it.\nLeonard: For what?\nPenny: What do you think? For doing the same crap he always does, except to a judge. He has to stay in there until he apologizes.\nLeonard: So tell him to apologize.\nPenny: Oh, gee, thanks, Leonard. That didn\u2019t occur to me. If he doesn\u2019t apologize by 5 o\u2019clock he is going to spend the night in jail.\nLeonard: Oh, no, that\u2019s terrible. Ooh, the line\u2019s moving. Got to go. Bye.\nScene: The police cell. \nSheldon: Excuse me? Excuse me, jailor?\nGuard: What?\nSheldon: I need to use the restroom.\nGuard: Knock yourself out. (Points to urinal in cell)\nSheldon: That\u2019s the toilet?\nGuard: Well, it ain\u2019t a wishing well.\nSheldon: Please tell the judge I\u2019m ready to apologize.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: Look at that. To my friend, Leonard, from Stan Lee, Excelsior!\nHoward: Awesome. Mine says, To my friend, Howard, from Stan Lee, Excelsior!\nRaj: Mine says, To Raj, from Stan Lee.\nHoward: That\u2019s \u2019cause you pissed him off about his character names.\nRaj: Hey, I didn\u2019t even mention Dum Dum Dugan or Green Goblin, Matt Murdock, Pepper Potts, Victor Von Doom, oh, and worst of all, Millie the Model.\nPenny: We\u2019re home.\nLeonard: Oh, hey, buddy. How\u2019d it go?\nSheldon: You know very well how it went.\nLeonard: Yeah, but we all want to hear it from you.\nSheldon: I was found guilty and fined $533.\nPenny: I\u2019m going to write you a cheque for that. As long as you promise to put it in your drawer and never cash it, like the others.\nSheldon: I also now have three points on a driver\u2019s licence I do not yet possess, and I was forced to issue an undeserved apology, simply because I refuse to urinate in a stainless steel bowl in front of criminals.\nHoward: Plus, you didn\u2019t get to meet Stan Lee.\nLeonard: Okay, that\u2019s enough, Howard. The poor guy\u2019s had a tough time. He had to spend the entire afternoon in jail wearing that suit.\nHoward: You\u2019re right, so it would be cruel to mention that after he finished signing autographs, Stan Lee took Stuart and us out for gelato.\nSheldon: You had gelato with Stan Lee?\nHoward: He said we could call him Stan.\nLeonard: Except for Raj.\nSheldon: Well, I hope you\u2019re satisfied, Penny. You are responsible for all the evil that has befallen me today.\nPenny: Okay, I realize that\u2026\nSheldon: Not finished. It is because of you that I now have a criminal record, and it is because of you that I missed out on having gelato with Stan Lee.\nPenny: Okay, maybe you\u2019ll have another chance to have\u2026\nSheldon: No, no. I will never have another chance to have gelato with Stan Lee because opportunities to have gelato with Stan Lee come but once in a lifetime. The moving finger writes, and having writ, moves on!\nPenny: Did he just somehow give me the finger?\nHoward: Not just the finger. The moving finger.\nScene: The comic book store.\n \nPenny: Hey, Stuart.\nStuart: Oh, hey, Penny. Wow. Hi.\nPenny: What\u2019s going on?\nStuart: Nothing. I\u2019m just getting ready to close up and head out.\nPenny: Ah. Cool. Got any fun plans?\nStuart: Oh, yeah. Big night tonight. Gonna share a can of tuna with the cat.\nPenny: Oh, nice.\nStuart: Not even my cat. I just feed it. Some nights it doesn\u2019t even show up.\nPenny: Oh, okay. Well, I was hoping, um, you could do me a favour.\nStuart: Sure, yeah, name it.\nPenny: Well, I\u2019m kind of responsible for Sheldon missing Stan Lee, and I really want to make it up to him. So I was hoping you could give me his phone number so maybe I can arrange for them to meet.\nStuart: Oh, I\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t have his phone number.\nPenny: Hmm. Damn. All right. Thank you.\nStuart: Mm-hmm. Wait. I have his address.\nPenny: Really? Great!\nStuart: But I can\u2019t give it to you.\nPenny: Then why did you tell me you had it?\nStuart: I don\u2019t know. Just chatting. You\u2019re looking at a guy who could very well get stood up by a stray cat tonight.\nPenny: I\u2019m sorry, Stuart. Thanks anyway.\nStuart: Mm-hmm. Wait.\nPenny: Yeah?\nStuart: Maybe we can make a deal.\nPenny: What kind of deal?\nStuart: I will give you the address if you go to my cousin\u2019s wedding with me.\nPenny: You\u2019re extorting a date out of me?\nStuart: I kind of have to. The cousin who\u2019s getting married is the cousin I usually go to weddings with.\nPenny: Can I bring Leonard?\nStuart: Sure. What the hell.\nPenny: Deal.\nStuart: We\u2019ll tell people he\u2019s your cousin.\nScene: Outside Stan Lee\u2019s house.\nSheldon: This is Stan Lee\u2019s front door. We were on Stan Lee\u2019s curb, then we were on Stan Lee\u2019s walk, and now we\u2019re at Stan Lee\u2019s front door.\nPenny: Yup.\nSheldon: Oh, Lord, you just rang Stan Lee\u2019s doorbell. At Stan Lee\u2019s house. We\u2019re about to go in and have milk and cookies with Stan Lee.\nPenny: Okay, sweetie, I don\u2019t know if we\u2019re gonna have cookies, or he\u2019s just gonna say hi, or really what\u2019s gonna happen, so just let me talk, and we\u2019ll\u2026\nStan Lee (opening door): Yeah?\nPenny: Are you Stan Lee?\nStan Lee: Oh, damn.\nPenny: Hi. I\u2019m Penny. This is my friend, Sheldon.\nSheldon: We\u2019re not friends at the moment. Depends on how this goes.\nPenny: Right, right. Anyway, Sheldon here is a huge fan of yours, and he was supposed to meet you the other day at the comic book store, but he kind of ended up in jail.\nStan Lee: I see. And you thought you\u2019d just come over to my house uninvited?\nSheldon: You said we were invited.\nPenny: Oh, no, no, I said I\u2019m inviting you to come with me to Stan Lee\u2019s house.\nStan Lee: You know, you fan boys are unbelievable. Do you think you can just ring my doorbell any time you want? I mean, why don\u2019t you just come on in and watch the Lakers game with me?\nSheldon: Well, I\u2019m not much of a sports fan, but thank you.\nPenny: I\u2019m sorry. He doesn\u2019t really understand sarcasm.\nStan Lee: Well, I\u2019ll give him something he\u2019ll understand. Joanie, call the police!\nPenny: Nice to meet you.\nScene: The apartment.\n \nRaj: Fantastic Four, Daredevil, Invincible Iron Man, Happy Hogan, Curt Connors\u2026\nHoward: Would you just let it go?\nRaj: And worst of all, Fin Fang Foom.\nLeonard (as Sheldon enters): Hey, where\u2019ve you been?\nSheldon: I\u2019ll tell you where I\u2019ve been. You boys may have had gelato with Stan Lee and gotten autographed comics, but I saw the inside of his house and got an autographed application for a restraining order.\nHoward: Sweet.\nSheldon: Plus, I get to hang out with him again at the hearing. This is going to look great hanging next to my restraining order from Leonard Nimoy.\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "7_19": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Boy, do I have to urinate.\nLeonard: If only there were a solution to that.\nSheldon: Seriously. I feel like I\u2019ve got a fish tank in my pelvis.\nLeonard: So go to the bathroom.\nSheldon: I can\u2019t.\nLeonard: Why not?\nSheldon: Because I\u2019m trying to decide between getting an Xbox One or a PS4. Oh, pee, why\u2019d I say that?\nLeonard: Forgive me for asking a stupid question, but why are you being stupid?\nSheldon: I\u2019m not being stupid. I\u2019m employing the work of Dutch researcher, Mirjam Tuk, who found that people with full bladders make better decisions.\nLeonard: Why did I pee before I decided to move in here?\nPenny: Hi.\nLeonard: Hey. Oh, how\u2019d the audition go?\nPenny: I killed it. I was even able to cry real tears right on the spot.\nLeonard: Oh, that\u2019s great.\nPenny: I know. Next time I get pulled over for a speeding ticket, here come the waterworks.\nSheldon: Here come the waterworks.\nLeonard: Aren\u2019t you gonna ask?\nPenny: What is this, my first day?\nCredits sequence. \nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment.\nBernadette: Can I get your opinion on something that happened at work today?\nPenny: Yeah, sure.\nAmy: Of course.\nBernadette: Okay, well, I did something that will either make me look like a lovable goof or a horrible monster damned to spend eternity in hell.\nAmy: I\u2019m sure it\u2019s lovable.\nPenny: I\u2019m gonna go with monster. What do you got?\nBernadette: Well, there\u2019s this lady in our office who\u2019s retiring, and they were passing around one of those big cards for us to sign.\nAmy: Okay.\nBernadette: But no one told me she was in a horrible car accident over the weekend and what I was signing was not a retirement card but was actually a get well card.\nPenny: I\u2019m liking my odds here.\nBernadette: So on the card, in the hospital, next to the woman who\u2019s clinging to life are the words, \u201cHey, Vivian. You deserve this. And at least with you gone, no one will steal my yoghurt out of the fridge.\u201d\nPenny: No.\nBernadette: \u201cLOL.\u201d Smiley face.\nAmy: Oh, my gosh.\nBernadette: \u201cP.S. Good luck wherever you wind up.\u201d\nPenny: Oh. Why didn\u2019t I put money on this? (Phone rings) Hey, that\u2019s my agent. If I got the part, it\u2019s still the second best thing I\u2019ve heard all day. Hello?\nBernadette: Am I a terrible person?\nAmy: No. No, it was a mistake.\nBernadette: Am I a terrible person that it crossed my mind that she might die and never see the card?\nAmy: Now I think you\u2019re flirting with the line. Good news?\nPenny: No, I didn\u2019t get it.\nBernadette: I\u2019m so sorry.\nAmy: You\u2019ll get offered something soon.\nPenny: I kind of did. The part in that awful horror movie I passed on came back around. Apparently, it\u2019s mine if I want it.\nBernadette: Are you gonna take it?\nPenny: I don\u2019t know what to do.\nAmy: Maybe you\u2019ll get hit by a car and die. LOL, right?\nScene: A coffee shop.\nRaj: Hey. Emily, right?\nEmily: Yeah.\nRaj: I, I don\u2019t know if you remember me.\nEmily: From the dating Web site. Your friend e-mailed me because you were afraid to, then you tracked me down and acted like a lunatic?\nRaj: Yes, Rajesh Koothrappali. Look, uh, I just, I wanted to say I\u2019m sorry. Okay? You were, like, the coolest person I ever found online, and I got really nervous and I, I just blew it.\nEmily: Uh, don\u2019t worry about it. And if it makes you feel any better, you\u2019re not the weirdest guy I\u2019ve met off the Internet.\nRaj: Well, give me a chance, you don\u2019t even know me.\nEmily: All right, here\u2019s your chance.\nRaj: Ah, really? Thank you. Fate has given me a rare second chance, and I swear to Vishnu I\u2019m not gonna blow it. Or normal words followed by a charming smile.\nScene: Amy\u2019s apartment.\nSheldon: So, first there was PlayStation, aka PS1, then PS2, PS3 and now PS4. And that makes sense. You\u2019d think after Xbox, there\u2019d be Xbox 2. But no, next came Xbox 360. Hmm? And now, after 360, comes Xbox One. Why one? Maybe that\u2019s how many seconds of thought they put into naming it.\nAmy: Can you get the butter, please?\nSheldon: You know, however, with the Xbox One, I can control my entire entertainment system using voice commands. Up until now, I\u2019ve had to use Leonard.\nAmy: Then get the other one. Pass the butter.\nSheldon: Get? Hang on. I don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re taking this dilemma seriously.\nAmy: Fine, Sheldon. You have my undivided attention.\nSheldon: Okay, now, the PS4 is more angular and sleek-looking.\nAmy: No way.\nSheldon: Yeah, well, it\u2019s true. But the larger size of the Xbox One may keep it from overheating.\nAmy: Well, you wouldn\u2019t want your gaming system to overheat.\nSheldon: No, see? Well, you absolutely would not. And furthermore, the Xbox One now comes with a Kinect included.\nAmy: Included?\nSheldon: Yes. Not sold separately. Although the PS4 uses cool new GDDR5 RAM, while the Xbox One is still using the conventional DDR3 memory.\nAmy: Why would they still be using DDR3? Are they nuts?\nSheldon: See? That\u2019s what I thought. But then they go and throw in an ESRAM buffer.\nAmy: Whoa, whoa. Wait a second. Who\u2019s they?\nSheldon: Xbox.\nAmy: You\u2019re kidding.\nSheldon: No, I am not. And this ESRAM buffer should totally bridge the 100-gigabit-per-second bandwidth gap between the two RAM types.\nAmy: This is a nightmare. How will you ever make a decision?\nSheldon You see? I don\u2019t know. What should I do?\nAmy: Please pass the butter!\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment.\nPenny: Okay, it\u2019s not me, right? This script is terrible.\nLeonard: Yeah. I had higher hopes for a movie called Serial Ape-ist 2: Monkey See, Monkey Kill. You know, it\u2019s still possible for you to be good in a bad movie.\nPenny: Okay. (Reading) Sometimes I feel like I can control the killer gorilla instinct inside of me, but then I see these bananas and I just want to eat them and then kill people. What am I gonna do?\nLeonard: Well, for starters, I wouldn\u2019t eat the bananas.\nPenny: No, come on. This is serious.\nLeonard: Uh, uh, does it at least pay well?\nPenny: Less than I was making at The Cheesecake Factory.\nLeonard: What does your agent think?\nPenny: She\u2019s thinking of taking a job at The Cheesecake Factory.\nLeonard: You know what, why don\u2019t you just do it? You\u2019ll go have fun for a few weeks, make some money, and who knows what it might lead to?\nPenny: Okay, look, here, page 58. I oil-wrestle an orang-utan in a bikini.\nLeonard: Just to clarify, which one of you is wearing the bikini?\nPenny: Both of us.\nLeonard: So it\u2019s a family film.\nScene: Amy\u2019s apartment. \nSheldon: Thank you again for dinner.\nAmy: You\u2019re welcome.\nSheldon: Good night.\nAmy: Uh, it\u2019s date night. Aren\u2019t you, uh, forgetting something?\nSheldon: Oh, of course. (They kiss) Did I mention the PS4 controllers light up?\nAmy: No.\nSheldon: Well, they do.\nScene: The apartment. \nRaj: And then after coffee, we went for a walk and she told me she always thought people from India were exotic and mysterious. So, with my mouth, I said, we\u2019re just like anybody else, but with my eyes, I said, straight up, Red, hop on my flying carpet.\nLeonard: So, are you gonna see her again?\nRaj: Yeah, we have plans this weekend. And if it\u2019s a clear night, I\u2019m gonna lay some romantic astronomy on her.\nPenny: Okay, like what? Show me.\nRaj: I can\u2019t do that to Leonard. This is some powerful panty-dropping stuff.\nLeonard: You have my blessing. Go for it.\nRaj: Okay. Penny, two of the brightest stars in the night sky are Altair and Vega. And it is said they were deeply in love but forever separated by the celestial river of the Milky Way.\nPenny: Oh, that\u2019s sad.\nRaj: It is. But once a year, on the seventh day of the seventh month, Vega cries so hard that all the magpies in the world fly up and create a bridge with their wings so the two lovers can be together for a single night of passion.\nPenny: Wow.\nLeonard: Okay, that\u2019s enough.\nSheldon: Quick poll, PS4 or Xbox One? Raj?\nRaj: Uh, Xbox One.\nSheldon: Penny?\nPenny: Huh?\nSheldon: Leonard?\nLeonard: PS4.\nSheldon: Wolowitz?\nHoward: Both great.\nSheldon: Bernadette?\nBernadette: I like the Wii.\nSheldon: Thanks, Grandma.\nRaj: Oh, my goodness.\nLeonard: What\u2019s up?\nRaj: I just got an e-mail from my ex-girlfriend Lucy. She misses me and wants to get together.\nLeonard: Two women at the same time? Nice job, playa.\nPenny: Really?\nLeonard: Was it the two women thing or the playa? It was the playa.\nScene: The same, later.\nRaj: What am I supposed to do? How am I supposed to choose between Emily and Lucy?\nHoward: Why do you have to choose? Date both of them.\nRaj: I can\u2019t date two women at once. Zero women, that\u2019s my sweet spot.\nPenny: Unless you\u2019re sleeping with one of them, seeing other people isn\u2019t a big deal.\nRaj: But what if one of them asks me what I was up to the night before and I was with the other one? Then, what, do I lie?\nHoward and Bernadette (together): Yes.\nBernadette: What do you mean, yes?\nHoward: What do you mean, yes?\nBernadette: Were you seeing other women when we started dating?\nHoward: No. Were you seeing other men?\nBernadette: No.\nLeonard: Were you seeing other men?\nPenny: No.\nLeonard: Aren\u2019t you gonna ask me?\nPenny: Come on, really?\nScene: A coffee shop.\nLeonard: Thank you so much for letting us pick your brain.\nWil Wheaton: Yeah, happy to help. So, what\u2019s going on?\nPenny: Well, I\u2019m having an impossible time getting my career off the ground, and I got offered a role in this crappy horror movie, and I just don\u2019t know if I should take it.\nWil: Well, I have certainly taken some jobs that I\u2019ve been embarrassed by.\nPenny: I wouldn\u2019t exactly call Star Trek embarrassing.\nWil: I wasn\u2019t.\nPenny: Me, either.\nLeonard: So, what do you think, is there a professional downside to doing it?\nWil: Well, it\u2019s tricky. You want to take projects that you\u2019re excited about, but sometimes you also have to pay the bills. When you\u2019re on the set working on something that you just know in your heart is bad, not Star Trek.\nPenny: Yeah, beam me up. I love it.\nWil: Anyway, those jobs can be soul-crushing.\nPenny: That\u2019s what I\u2019m afraid of.\nWil: So, I was in Stand By Me when I was a kid, and it was a huge success. The terrible movies I did came after that. I mean, imagine how that feels.\nLeonard: Sounds rough.\nWil: I\u2019m telling you, this business is brutal. To this day, I hate going on auditions. Okay, I walk in, and I can just feel them thinking, he was such a cute kid, what happened to him? And then I don\u2019t get the job, and I can never find out why. Honestly, I get so depressed, there are entire weeks that I can\u2019t even get out of bed.\nLeonard: Okay, this was helpful.\nScene: The stairwell.\nRaj: Any news on your co-worker who\u2019s in the hospital?\nBernadette: Poor thing, she was in surgery for 18 hours. She\u2019s alive, but she\u2019s still in critical condition.\nRaj: Oh, no.\nBernadette: The one bit of good news is they put her in a medically induced coma before she read the card. So, you know, silver linings.\nHoward: Were you like this when I married you?\nScene: The apartment. \nLeonard (on phone): Don\u2019t worry about it, buddy. Okay, bye. That was Wil, he\u2019s feeling a lot better. Apparently, he\u2019s 12-down in the TV Guide crossword puzzle.\nRaj: Did he help you make a decision about the movie?\nPenny: No. Did you figure out what you\u2019re gonna do about the two girls?\nRaj: As a matter of fact, I did. I\u2019ve spent so many years living in fear, saying no to new experiences, but from now on, I\u2019m gonna say yes, yes to love, yes to adventure, yes to life. Whatever it may be, the answer\u2019s going to be yes.\nHoward: He\u2019s gonna die alone, right?\nLeonard: Yes.\nPenny: Yes.\nBernadette: Yes.\nScene: An electrical store.\nAmy: I\u2019m proud of you, Sheldon.\nSheldon: You know, I\u2019m proud of me, too. I\u2019ve done all my research, I conducted an informal poll, and I\u2019ve arrived at the rock-solid certainty I\u2019ve made the right choice.\nAmy: Well, that\u2019s got to be a good feeling.\nSheldon: Oh, it is. Although.\nAmy: Oh, crap.\nSheldon: I had the same feeling when I made my dad buy a Betamax instead of a VHS.\nAmy: You were just a little kid.\nSheldon: Yeah, a little kid who picked the wrong format to record The MacNeil/Lehrer Report. Now I also was certain that HD DVD would win out over Blu-ray.\nAmy: How old were you then?\nSheldon: Old enough to know better. You know, and now that I think about it, I stood in front of a case of iPods and I bought a Zune.\nAmy: What\u2019s a Zune?\nSheldon: Yeah, exactly. It\u2019s an MP3 player brought to us by the makers of Xbox.\nAmy: No, what are you doing? No, no, pick that back up. You know it\u2019s good. You did the research.\nSheldon: But what if I\u2019m wrong?\nAmy: You know what? How about I buy it for you? How about I buy you both?\nSheldon: You know I only have one slot available in my entertainment centre.\nAmy: Then I\u2019ll buy you a new entertainment centre.\nSheldon: Well, yeah, okay, sure. But which one?\nAmy: How about this? I\u2019ve heard that if you flip a coin, it will tell you how you actually feel. Because you\u2019ll either be disappointed or excited by the outcome.\nSheldon: Interesting.\nAmy: So, heads it\u2019s PS4, tails it\u2019s Xbox One.\nSheldon: All right, I\u2019ll try.\nAmy: What is it?\nSheldon: A quarter.\nAmy: Could have given it back to me. That was a choice.\nScene: A restaurant.\nRaj: You look, you look really pretty tonight.\nEmily: Thanks. I love that jacket.\nRaj: Thank you. Thanks, thanks. I\u2019m sorry. I can\u2019t do this. My, my ex-girlfriend e-mailed me, and I\u2019m seeing her Saturday, And I\u2019m glad you like it, it\u2019s from J. Crew.\nEmily: I don\u2019t understand.\nRaj: My friends told me it was okay to see more than one person at a time, but it, it feels like I\u2019m being deceitful.\nEmily: Are you getting back together with her?\nRaj: No. I, I have no idea. What would you do?\nEmily: Uh, usually on first dates, I talk about music and stuff, but I was promised weird, so let\u2019s do this. How serious were you two?\nRaj: Well, to be honest, we only went on four dates, hugged twice, kissed once, and there was a handshake loaded with sexual innuendo.\nEmily: Wait, so, a girl you never slept with sent you an e-mail and you felt so guilty about it that you had to tell me?\nRaj: Yeah.\nEmily: That\u2019s kind of adorable.\nRaj: Are you, are you sure? Because this is the part of the night where I\u2019ve said something stupid and the girl usually leaves.\nEmily: I\u2019m still here.\nRaj: Yeah, but now you make me wonder what\u2019s wrong with you.\nEmily: We just met. You don\u2019t need to tell me about other people you\u2019re seeing.\nRaj: Really? Because I\u2019m dating two women is basically the only cool thing I can say about myself.\nScene: The electrical store.\nSheldon: On the one hand, the Xbox One has a better camera, but the PS4 has a removable hard drive. Thoughts?\nAmy: I can\u2019t feel my legs.\nStore assistant: Oh, I\u2019m sorry, guys, but the store closed five minutes ago.\nSheldon: But I haven\u2019t decided yet.\nStore assistant: You\u2019ll have to come back tomorrow. The registers are closed.\nAmy: Let\u2019s get you some food. You, You\u2019ll feel better after you eat.\nSheldon: Okay.\nAmy: What-what do you want, like, Thai food? A burger?\nSheldon: I don\u2019t know. Hey, look, a quarter.\nScene: A film set. Penny is being fitted with gorilla hands.\nCostume guy: How\u2019s that feel?\nPenny: Great. Not like regret at all.\nWil: Penny? We\u2019re working together. Awesome.\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "3_20": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The lobby.\nPenny: Oh, damn, they cancelled my Visa. Oh, yay, a new MasterCard!\nSheldon: Uh-oh.\nPenny: What?\nSheldon: I was going to get my mail.\nPenny: Okay. Are, are you hoping to get it telepathically?\nSheldon: I think you mean telekinetically. And no, I just wasn\u2019t sure of the proper protocol now that you and Leonard are no longer having coitus.\nPenny: God, can we please just say no longer seeing each other?\nSheldon: Well, we could if it were true. But as you live in the same building, you see each other all the time. The variable which has changed is the coitus.\nPenny: Okay, here\u2019s the protocol, you and I are still friends, and you stop saying coitus.\nSheldon: Good, good. I\u2019m glad we\u2019re still friends.\nPenny: Really?\nSheldon: Oh, yes. It was a lot of work to accommodate you in my life. I\u2019d hate for that effort to have been in vain.\nPenny: Right.\nSheldon: Just to be clear do I have to stop saying coitus with everyone or just you?\nPenny: Everyone.\nSheldon: Harsh terms. But all right, I\u2019ll just substitute intercourse.\nPenny: Great.\nSheldon: Or fornication. Yeah. But that has judgmental overtones, so I\u2019ll hold that in reserve.\nPenny: So, how you been?\nSheldon: Well, my existence is a continuum, so I\u2019ve been what I am at each point in the implied time period.\nPenny: You\u2019re just coitusing with me, aren\u2019t you?\nSheldon: Bazinga.\nPenny: Mmm. How\u2019s Leonard doing?\nSheldon: He seems all right. Although he does spend a disturbing amount of time looking at photographs of you and smelling the pillow you slept on. Oh, but now that I think of it, he asked me not to tell you that.\nPenny: I\u2019ll pretend I didn\u2019t hear it.\nSheldon: I\u2019d rather you pretend I didn\u2019t say it. I see you bought Mama Italia marinara spaghetti sauce.\nPenny: Yep.\nSheldon: That\u2019s the sauce my mother uses. She likes cooking Italian because according to her, that\u2019s what the Romans made Jesus eat.\nPenny: Interesting. I\u2019ll have to have you over for spaghetti some night.\nSheldon: I\u2019m hungry now.\nPenny: Oh. Um, okay. Why don\u2019t you give me an hour and come over?\nSheldon: Will you cut up hot dogs into little chunks and mix them in with the sauce?\nPenny: I don\u2019t have hot dogs.\nSheldon: Oh, it\u2019s all right, I do. Oh! You\u2019re in for what my mother calls a real Eye-talian treat. (Enters apartment).\nLeonard: Hey, where you been?\nSheldon: I was talking with Penny.\nHoward: What\u2019s wrong with you? You can\u2019t hang out with your roommate\u2019s ex. That\u2019s totally uncool.\nLeonard: No, no, it\u2019s fine. I don\u2019t care. I\u2019m over it.\nRaj: Yeah, he\u2019s over it, that\u2019s why he\u2019s been whining all day about trying to invent that memory-wiper gizmo from Men in Black.\nSheldon: Is he making any progress? Because I\u2019d like to erase Ben Affleck as Daredevil.\nHoward: So would Ben Affleck. The point is, in a situation like this you got to pick sides. You\u2019re either on Team Leonard or Team Penny.\nSheldon: Which one picks last?\nHoward: What?\nSheldon: Well, usually I\u2019m on the team that picks last. Unless there\u2019s a kid in a wheelchair.\nLeonard: Sheldon, I got you your tangerine chicken. I hope you\u2019re hungry.\nSheldon: Well, of course I\u2019m hungry. And as I have no plans to eat with any other team, I will consume my tangerine chicken with the appropriate gusto. Mm, mm, mm!\nLeonard: Okay.\nSheldon: Just out of curiosity, do we still have hot dogs?\nLeonard: I don\u2019t know. Why?\nSheldon: Just making dinner conversation. Go, Team Leonard!\nCredits sequence\n \nScene: A few moments later.\nHoward: Oh, God, this is good.\nRaj: Let me ask you a question. Do you believe you\u2019re going to go to hell for eating sweet and sour pork?\nHoward: Jews don\u2019t have hell. We have acid reflux.\nLeonard: Do you want the last dumpling, Sheldon?\nSheldon: Certainly. It\u2019s not like I have to moderate my food intake because I\u2019m planning on eating again very shortly. Mm, mm, mm!\nLeonard: So, you guys want to do something tonight?\nHoward: Nah, I can\u2019t. I got to pick up my mom from her water aerobics class. 18 overweight women flapping their arm fat in a swimming pool. Looks like the manatee tank at Sea World.\nLeonard: What about you, Raj?\nRaj: Oh, there it is, now that you don\u2019t have a girlfriend, you want to hang out with me again.\nLeonard: I never stopped hanging out with you.\nRaj: Oh, please, we all know I\u2019m the friend you call when you have no other options. If we were the Justice League, I\u2019d be Aquaman.\nHoward: I wish you were Aquaman. Then I could send you to scoop my mom out of the old lady tank.\nSheldon: Excuse me, I\u2019m thirsty, so I\u2019m going to go to the refrigerator and get myself a refreshing beverage.\nLeonard: You know what? I\u2019ll just spend the evening alone.\nRaj: What, suddenly I\u2019m not good enough for you?\nSheldon: Ah, I do so love beverages. Now I think I\u2019ll take my after-dinner walk.\nLeonard: Since when do you take after-dinner walks?\nHoward: Yeah, since when do you take walks?\nSheldon: I read a study online that walking after a meal not only aids in digestion, but increases serotonin, and you know me, if there\u2019s one thing I like more than a refreshing beverage, it\u2019s serotonin. Bye-bye.\nHoward: Hold on. I\u2019ll walk down with you.\nSheldon: Oh, that\u2019s not necessary. You can go first.\nHoward: Or we could go together.\nSheldon: I can\u2019t think of a reason why not.\nHoward: Let\u2019s go.\nSheldon: Hold on. Nope, no reason.\nRaj: I\u2019ve missed you.\nScene: The lobby.\nSheldon: All right, say hello to your mother for me.\nHoward: Okay.\nSheldon: What?\nHoward: You said you were going for a walk.\nSheldon: I didn\u2019t say outside.\nHoward: So what, you\u2019re just gonna walk up and down the stairs?\nSheldon: No, of course not. That would be odd and suspicious behavior.\nWoman\u2019s voice: Here Bubbles. Here boy.\nHoward: Which way are you going?\nSheldon: Which way are you going?\nHoward: I parked my scooter down the block.\nSheldon: I\u2019m going the other way. Bye.\nHoward: Bye. Actually, I\u2019m this way. Do I smell hot dogs?\nSheldon: No. I mean, I have no idea what you smell.\nHoward: I definitely smell raw hot dog.\nSheldon: Perhaps you\u2019re getting a brain tumour.\nHoward: All right, have a nice walk.\nSheldon: I shall. Have a nice scoot.\nHoward: You might want to stand back. I\u2019m sitting on top of 13 horses here.\nSheldon: Oh. Hello, doggie. Nice doggie. I bet you think you smell hot dogs. Look, a cat!\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment.\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Penny, (knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Long pause, knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Penny opens door. A dishevelled Sheldon is holding up one hot dog.) Here. I had to trade the others for my life.\nScene: The apartment.\nRaj: Hey, Leonard?\nLeonard: Yeah?\nRaj: I haven\u2019t had sex in a year.\nLeonard: Where you going with this, Raj?\nRaj: Don\u2019t flatter yourself, dude. I want to go out and meet a woman.\nLeonard: So, go.\nRaj: Well, I need a wingman. I don\u2019t want to come off like a lonely loser.\nLeonard: And you think my presence will help with that?\nRaj: Well, I do. Next to you, I\u2019ll look like a catch.\nLeonard: I\u2019m not going out tonight, Raj.\nRaj: All right. Would you mind if I went to your room and downloaded some Asian pornography?\nLeonard: Very much.\nRaj: Doesn\u2019t have to be Asian.\nLeonard: Don\u2019t worry. You\u2019ll meet a girl someday.\nRaj: No, I won\u2019t.\nLeonard: Yes, you will, and she\u2019ll be beautiful, and kind and sexy and funny and everything you ever wanted in a woman.\nRaj: You really think so?\nLeonard: I do, and you\u2019ll fall hopelessly in love and give her your heart. And she\u2019ll take it and grind it into pathetic, little pieces.\nRaj: But we\u2019ll have sex first, right?\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment.\nSheldon: Mmm, mmm, mmm. That\u2019s Eye-talian.\nPenny: So, um, was Leonard okay with you coming over?\nSheldon: Oh, yes. In fact, he said, I\u2019m fine, I don\u2019t care. And he in no way said it in a manner which would lead one to believe that he was covering up feelings of anguish and betrayal.\nPenny: Well, good.\nSheldon: I\u2019m also pleased to report that he\u2019s all cried out over you.\nPenny: He\u2019s been crying?\nSheldon: Oh, I believe that was something else I wasn\u2019t supposed to mention.\nPenny: Oh, God, I feel terrible.\nSheldon: Do you have a stomach ache, too?\nPenny: No. Why, do you?\nSheldon: No.\nPenny: Why did you ask if I had one, too?\nSheldon: Just making polite dinner conversation. Your turn.\nPenny: All right. So, what\u2019s new in your life?\nSheldon: Well, my new shoes are not made for running.\nPenny: Have you been running?\nSheldon: No. It\u2019s just a suspicion I have. Mmm, mmm, mmm.\nPenny: I\u2019m so glad you like it.\nSheldon: I do. Leonard never cooks for me.\nPenny: Well, maybe that\u2019s \u2019cause Leonard can\u2019t cook.\nSheldon: You can\u2019t cook and you made me this.\nPenny: Whatever. Ooh, I\u2019m gonna get the cheesecake out of the fridge.\nSheldon: Oh, Lord, I\u2019m in Jewish hell.\nScene: The apartment.\nRaj: Look at this. Do you think she\u2019s really doing that or is it PhotoShop?\nLeonard: I\u2019m pretty sure Martha Stewart never got naked with a room full of big, fat Japanese guys.\nRaj: You don\u2019t know that. Prison changes people.\nLeonard: Hey, where you been?\nSheldon: I told you, walking.\nLeonard: For an hour and a half?\nSheldon: I got lost.\nLeonard: How could you get lost? Your phone has GPS.\nSheldon: Satellites are down. Solar flares.\nRaj: There are no solar flares right now.\nSheldon: Yes, there are.\nRaj: Dude, I\u2019m an astrophysicist. If there were solar flares, I\u2019d be all up in it.\nSheldon: I\u2019m sorry. I misspoke. What I meant to say was my battery died.\nLeonard: What the hell was that about?\nRaj: I don\u2019t know. Do you think this is really Hillary Clinton doing it with Oprah?\nLeonard: Oh, we really need to get you a girl.\nScene: Leonard\u2019s bedroom. Leonard is asleep.\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard, (knock, knock, knock) Leonard, (knock, knock, knock) Leonard.\nLeonard: Oh, just come in!\nSheldon: Thanks for seeing me on such short notice.\nLeonard: What do you want, Sheldon?\nSheldon: Maybe this isn\u2019t a good time.\nLeonard: Tell me why you woke me up or I swear to God I will kill you.\nSheldon: Do you really think death threats are an appropriate way to begin this conversation? Sometimes your lack of social skills astonishes me.\nLeonard: What do you want?\nSheldon: You may want to sit down.\nLeonard: I\u2019m in bed!\nSheldon: Point taken. You may want to sit up.\nLeonard: Sheldon!\nSheldon: I\u2019ve been seeing Penny behind your back.\nLeonard: Okay, when you say seeing Penny, what exactly does that mean?\nSheldon: We had dinner last night. She made me spaghetti with little hot dogs cut up in it. Well, little hot dog. I gave up the other five hot dogs to a real dog. A real, big dog. A hell hound. Tangential to the primary story. How about I circle back to it?\nLeonard: Fine. Why did you have dinner with Penny?\nSheldon: I told you, she made spaghetti with little hot dogs. I like spaghetti with little hot dogs.\nLeonard: Then why did you have Chinese food with us?\nSheldon: I didn\u2019t want to upset you. Howard made it very clear that my allegiance should be to male comrades before women who sell their bodies for money.\nLeonard: Is it possible he said Bros before Hos?\nSheldon: Yes, but I rephrased it to avoid offending the hos.\nLeonard: Sheldon, I don\u2019t care if you want to be friends with Penny.\nSheldon: Oh. Well, so the emotional turmoil that\u2019s been keeping me from achieving REM sleep was entirely unjustified?\nLeonard: Yes.\nSheldon: Well then as my meemaw would say, looks like we butchered a pig, but nobody wanted bacon.\nLeonard: I guess not.\nSheldon: And now, as promised, the tangent. Sheldon and the Hell Hound, or How I Lost My Hot Dogs.\nScene: The laundry room.\nPenny: Oh, um, I, I can come back.\nLeonard: D-don\u2019t be silly. We\u2019re neighbours, we\u2019re going to run into each other, may as well get used to it.\nPenny: Yeah, I guess you\u2019re right.\nLeonard: You used to it yet?\nPenny: Nope.\nLeonard: Me neither. Oh, Sheldon seemed think that I would be upset about you hanging out with him. But I just want you to know it\u2019s fine.\nPenny: Oh, oh, good, because, um, his mother called me.\nLeonard: His mother?\nPenny: Yeah, she wants me to take him shopping for sheets and towels.\nLeonard: I was going to do that.\nPenny: Oh, well, then you, you do it.\nLeonard: No, I don\u2019t want to do it. You can do it.\nPenny: Okay, you can take him for shoes.\nLeonard: I just took him for shoes.\nPenny: Well, all I know is he says they hurt his feet.\nLeonard: Fine. I\u2019ll take him for shoes next Saturday.\nPenny: Oh, no, no, no, a bunch of us from work are going to Disneyland next Saturday and Sheldon wants to come.\nLeonard: You\u2019re taking him to Disneyland?\nPenny: Well, he heard me making plans on the phone. Was I going to say no?\nLeonard: All right. But let me know if you\u2019re going to stuff him with junk food. I don\u2019t want to bring home a nice dinner for him and see it go to waste.\nPenny: We\u2019re going to Disneyland. He\u2019s going to eat junk food.\nLeonard: All I\u2019m saying is give me a heads-up.\nPenny: Okay, whatever.\nLeonard: And don\u2019t let him go on Space Mountain after he eats. He\u2019ll say he can handle it, but I promise you\u2019ll end up with churro puke on your shoes.\nPenny: All right, got it. Is there anything else?\nLeonard: Yeah, don\u2019t let Goofy near him. He\u2019ll have nightmares and I\u2019ll have to deal with it.\nPenny: What\u2019s the problem with Goofy?\nLeonard: Wish I knew. He\u2019s fine with Pluto.\nScene: The apartment. \nRaj: Hey, do you think the elastic woman in The Incredibles needs to use birth control or can she just be a diaphragm?\nHoward: Well, that\u2019s it. We\u2019re officially out of things to talk about.\nPenny: We\u2019re home.\nLeonard: It\u2019s ten o\u2019clock, where have you been?\nSheldon: We stayed for the California Adventure water show. It was pure Disney magic.\nLeonard: I was going to see that with him.\nPenny: How was I supposed to know that?\nSheldon: It\u2019s all right. I\u2019ll see it again with you.\nLeonard: And I have food here. You said you were going to call.\nPenny: I know, I know.\nSheldon: I can still eat.\nPenny: No, you already threw up once. Go put on your PJs and brush your teeth.\nSheldon: Okay, but just don\u2019t fight\nLeonard: We\u2019re not fighting.\nPenny: Just go.\nLeonard: Aren\u2019t you going to thank Penny for taking you to Disneyland?\nSheldon: Thank you, Penny.\nPenny: You\u2019re welcome, sweetie.\nLeonard: Want a cup of coffee?\nPenny: Oh, um, I should probably get going.\nLeonard: Come on. It\u2019s just a cup of coffee.\nPenny: Yep, okay.\nHoward (to Raj, who has whispered to him): Oh, yeah, the whole thing seems a little twisted to me, too.\nLeonard: What am I smelling?\nPenny: Sheldon\u2019s churro on my shoes.\nScene: Sheldon\u2019s bedroom.\nPenny: He\u2019s such an angel when he\u2019s asleep.\nLeonard: Yeah. Shame he has to wake up.\nPenny: I think we can do it.\nLeonard: Smother Sheldon in his sleep? Wouldn\u2019t that be wrong?\nPenny: No, be friends. You and me.\nLeonard: Oh. Sure. Absolutely.\nPenny: Good. I\u2019m glad.\nLeonard: Here\u2019s an idea. I\u2019m just throwing it out there, friends who have sex.\nPenny: Good night, Leonard.\nLeonard: Kidding.

Thanks to your hard work, an international crew of astronauts will boldly go\nwhere no man has gone before.\nHoward: Is that supposed to be funny?\nSheldon: I believe it is. The combination of the Star Trek reference and the play on words involving the double-meaning of the verb to go suggests that Leonard is humorously mocking your efforts in space plumbing.\nHoward: Okay, make your little jokes, but of the four of us, I\u2019m the only one making any real-world contribution to science and technology.\nRaj: He\u2019s right. This is an important achievement, for two reasons. Number one, and, of course, number two.\nSheldon: Oh, clever! Playing on the use of cardinal numbers as euphemisms for bodily functions.\nStuart: Here, Sheldon, I pulled the new Hellboy for you. It\u2019s mind-blowing.\nSheldon: Excuse me, spoiler alert.\nStuart: I didn\u2019t spoil anything.\nSheldon: You told me it\u2019s mind-blowing, so, my mind is going into it pre-blown. And once a mind is pre-blown, it cannot be re-blown.\nStuart: I\u2019m sorry.\nSheldon: Said the Grinch to Christmas.\nStuart: Uh, hey, Leonard, can I talk to you about something?\nLeonard: Oh, sure, what\u2019s up?\nStuart: Remember I went out with your friend Penny a couple weeks ago?\nLeonard: Yeah, vaguely.\nRaj: Sure you remember. You went to the bar and made a fool of yourself trying to pick up strange women.\nLeonard: What about it?\nStuart: Well, uh, the thing is, the date didn\u2019t go that well.\nLeonard: Oh, too bad. I guess the thing to do now is just pick yourself up, dust yourself off, forget it and move on.\nStuart: I can\u2019t do that.\nLeonard: Why the hell not?\nStuart: \u2018Cause we\u2019re going out again tomorrow.\nSheldon: Excuse me, Stuart. Have you read the new Flash?\nStuart: No.\nSheldon: Well, I have and it will knock your socks off! Good luck getting them back on.\nStuart: Uh, anyway, I figured this is probably my last shot with Penny and I don\u2019t want to screw it up.\nLeonard: Nobody wants that.\nStuart: So, here\u2019s my question. It\u2019s the second date, you think she\u2019ll be expecting things to get physical?\nLeonard: Uh, oh, gee, my initial reaction is no. You know, let me think about it and get back to you, okay?\nStuart: Okay, so, you\u2019ll give me a call?\nLeonard: Yeah, or you call me.\nStuart: Great.\nLeonard: Or nobody calls anyone.\nRaj: Interesting. Penny\u2019s current suitor asking advice from her former suitor.\nLeonard: You know, thanks for closed-captioning my pain, Raj.\nHoward: Hey, wanna make sure he gets nowhere with Penny without jeopardizing your friendship with either of them?\nLeonard: I\u2019m listening.\nHoward: Just tell him to do everything you\u2019ve done with her for the last two years.\nCredits sequence.\n \nScene: The lobby.\nPenny: Hey, Leonard.\nLeonard: Oh, hi.\nPenny: How\u2019s it going?\nLeonard: Good, good. You?\nPenny: Fine. Oh, hey, can I ask you something?\nLeonard: Sure.\nPenny: You know your friend Stuart?\nLeonard: Yes.\nPenny: Well, he asked me out again and I said yes, and then I started thinking maybe I should talk to you first.\nLeonard: About what?\nPenny: Well, does it bother you, me going out with one of your friends? \u2018Cause you know, you and me\u2026\nLeonard: No, no that\u2019s the past. I\u2019m really more of a right now kind of guy. You know, living in the moment. Although I do have to live a little in the future, \u2019cause, well, that\u2019s my job. Of course, my fondness for classic science fiction does draw my attention backwards, but those stories often take place in the future. In conclusion, no, it doesn\u2019t bother me.\nPenny: Okay, well, that\u2019s really cool of you.\nLeonard: Yeah, well I wouldn\u2019t say cool, I\u2019d just say, that\u2019s Leonard!\nPenny: Well, In that case, do you mind giving me some advice?\nLeonard: About Stuart? Love to.\nPenny: He\u2019s very shy, how do I make him feel more comfortable around me?\nLeonard: Well, uh, first of all, don\u2019t underestimate the value of discomfort.\nPenny: Really?\nLeonard: Well, yeah, Stuart thrives under pressure, that\u2019s why he works in a comic book store.\nScene: The university cafeteria. Leonard\u2019s phone rings. \nLeonard: Oh. It\u2019s Stuart.\nSheldon: You\u2019re not going to answer it?\nLeonard: He wants to talk about Penny. I don\u2019t want to talk about Penny.\nSheldon: You\u2019re making an assumption. Perhaps the comic book store is on fire, and he needs your assistance.\nLeonard: Why would he call me?\nSheldon: We don\u2019t know. And if you don\u2019t answer the phone, we can\u2019t know.\nLeonard: I\u2019m not answering the phone, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Answer the phone, Leonard.\nLeonard: No! There, it went to voice mail.\nSheldon: Aren\u2019t you going to check your messages?\nLeonard: No.\nSheldon: You have to check your messages, the leaving of a message is one half of a social contract which is completed by the checking of the message. If that contract breaks down then all social contracts break down and we descend into anarchy.\nLeonard: It must be hell inside your head.\nSheldon: At times.\nHoward: Guys, we have a code red.\nSheldon: Do you mean code red the hospital emergency alert, code red the computer worm, or code red the cherry flavoured soft drink from the makers of Mountain Dew?\nHoward: Look, I was going over the schematics on my zero-G toilet, and I made a teeny tiny mistake on the specifications for the diverter valve.\nLeonard: How teeny tiny?\nHoward: It\u2019s gonna fail after about ten flushes.\nSheldon: But the mission is for six months.\nHoward: Yeah, see, that\u2019s the code red. It\u2019s kind of like a jack-in-the-box, no one knows exactly when, but at some point something way worse than a puppet is gonna pop out of that box.\nSheldon: Have you notified NASA?\nHoward: No. Are you crazy?What am I gonna say? I screwed up your toilet and pretty soon there\u2019s gonna be crap floating all over your nice shiny space station?\nLeonard: Well, what are you gonna do?\nHoward: I\u2019m gonna figure out how to fix it, then I\u2019ll tell them.\nLeonard: So, what do you need us for?\nRaj: He can\u2019t figure out how to fix it.\nHoward: Hey, you said you were gonna be supportive.\nRaj: I\u2019m trying, but you have to admit this is pretty damn funny.\nSheldon: I agree. It\u2019s the juxtaposition of the high-tech nature of space exploration against the banality of a malfunctioning toilet that provides the comic fodder here. Check your messages.\nScene: The apartment.\nHoward: All right, this is an exact duplicate of the Wolowitz Zero-Gravity Human Waste Disposal System as deployed on the International Space Station.\nRaj: Don\u2019t you mean the Wolowitz Zero-Gravity Human Waste Distribution System?\nLeonard: Good one.\nRaj: Yeah.\nHoward: Yeah, ha, it\u2019s hilarious. Now, here\u2019s an approximation of the spare parts available on the Space Station. We gotta find a way, using nothing but this, to reinforce this so the waste material avoids the spinning turbine.\nRaj: You mean so it doesn\u2019t hit the fan?\nSheldon: Yeah, I have to say, I thought the toilet humour would get less funny with repetition. Apparently, there is no law of diminishing comedic returns with space poop. (There is a knock on the door)\nStuart: Hey Leonard.\nLeonard: Hey Stuart.\nStuart: You busy?\nLeonard: Um\u2026\nHoward: Classified, Leonard.\nLeonard: Yeah, it\u2019s a regular Manhattan Project. What\u2019s up?\nStuart: Well, tonight\u2019s my date with Penny and since we haven\u2019t been able to connect by phone\u2026\nLeonard: Yeah, I\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s been broken.\nStuart: Or e-mail.\nLeonard: Yeah, that too. Everything\u2019s broken.\nStuart: Anyway, I was just wondering if you had any last-minute advice.\nLeonard: All right, well, off the top of my head, I think the most important thing with Penny is to go really slow. I mean, glacial.\nStuart: Okay.\nLeonard: You know, guys come onto her all the time, so, you need to, like, set yourself apart. You know, be a little shy, don\u2019t make too much eye contact. And, you know, treat her with, like, cool detachment and, and, and, you know, fear.\nStuart: Fear?\nLeonard: Yeah, like, you\u2019re afraid that if you touch her, she\u2019ll break.\nStuart: Well, that plays right into my wheelhouse.\nLeonard: Good, good. Well, you kids have fun tonight.\nStuart: Thanks, Leonard. What is that thing anyway?\nHoward: You don\u2019t know what this is?\nStuart: No.\nHoward: Good. Get out.\nRaj: Be afraid of Penny, nice, very crafty.\nLeonard: It wasn\u2019t bad advice. It just wasn\u2019t particularly helpful.\nSheldon: For what it\u2019s worth, my mother says that when we deceive for personal gain, we make Jesus cry.\nScene: Later.\nSheldon: All right, what if we use this two-inch PVC to reinforce the centre cross-support?\nHoward: No good. I mean, it might work for the Japanese and the Americans, but have you seen the size of the Russians they got up there? This thing has to hold up against a hearty potato-based diet.\nLeonard: I feel terrible.\nHoward: Maybe if you were helping, you\u2019d feel better about yourself.\nLeonard: I deliberately tried to sabotage Stuart\u2019s date with Penny.\nRaj: Of course you feel terrible. You completely screwed up your karma, dude.\nSheldon: You don\u2019t really believe in that superstition, do you?\nRaj: It\u2019s not superstition. It\u2019s practically Newtonian. For every action, there\u2019s an equal and opposite reaction. Leonard pretends to be a friend and acts like a two-faced bitch, therefore, he is reborn as a banana slug. It\u2019s actually a very elegant system, you know, what goes around comes around.\nHoward: Speaking of what goes around comes around\u2026\nRaj: Okay, look. Instead of trying to reinforce this structure here, what if we just ran another line, bypass it entirely?\nSheldon: It won\u2019t work. The diameter of the tubing is insufficient.\nRaj: What if we reposition the collection tank?\nSheldon: It won\u2019t work. No way to mount it.\nHoward: Okay, here\u2019s an idea. What if I change my name and go live with my cousin and her husband Avi in Israel?\nSheldon: That could work.\nScene: Outside Penny\u2019s door. Leonard knocks, Penny answers in her dressing gown.\nLeonard: Morning.\nPenny: Morning. What\u2019s up?\nLeonard: Nothing. We just pulled an all-nighter trying to fix a zero-gravity\u2026 pasta maker. I\u2019m gonna make a coffee run. Do you want any?\nPenny: Oh, no, thanks. I have coffee.\nLeonard: Great. So how\u2019d it go with Stuart last night?\nPenny: I really don\u2019t want to talk about it.\nLeonard: Yeah. Right. Sure. The thing is, before you guys went out, I spoke to him and\u2026\nPenny: I said I don\u2019t want to talk about it.\nLeonard: Okay\u2026 I just\u2026 I kind of\u2026\nPenny: Look, Leonard, what goes on between me and Stuart is none of your business. So just leave it alone, okay?\nRaj: If you really want to clean up your karma, go get my freakin\u2019 latte.\nScene: The apartment. \nHoward: Hang on, I think I\u2019ve got this. Help me see if we can wedge this little piece of PVC behind the support rod.\nSheldon: You\u2019re overestimating the tensile strength of the substructure you\u2019re building.\nHoward: Sheldon, I know what I\u2019m doing.\nSheldon: If you knew what you were doing, there wouldn\u2019t be a space toilet where my coffee table should be.\nRaj: Howard, wait. Why don\u2019t you use this instead of the PVC to keep the transverse filter assembly in place?\nHoward: Because this is not a spare part from the space station. This is the thing from the pizza box that keeps the lid from touching the cheese.\nRaj: That what that\u2019s for? In India, the lid just touches the cheese. Of course, we also have rampant poverty and periodic outbreaks of cholera, so a little cardboard in our cheese is no biggie.\nHoward: Where are you going?\nLeonard: Comic book store.\nSheldon: Oh, an excellent idea! I could certainly use a break.\nRaj: Me, too.\nHoward: Hold on, you can go to the comic book store when man can once again safely poop in space.\nSheldon: Why does Leonard get to go?\nLeonard: \u2018Cause he\u2019s upset over his situation with Penny and if I have to hear about it again, I\u2019m going to kick him in his ovaries.\nLeonard: Thanks for understanding, Howard.\nHoward: I got your back, sister. All right, I think we\u2019ve got a prototype ready to test. Hand me that Tupperware.\nRaj: Wow, that\u2019s heavy.\nHoward: Damn right it\u2019s heavy, it\u2019s my mother\u2019s meat loaf, it\u2019s been testing toilets for generations.\nSheldon: I must say, Howard, I think a detailed letter to MIT describing your current circumstances might entitle you to a refund on your master\u2019s degree.\nHoward: Okay, simulated zero-gravity human waste disposal test with meat loaf analog in three, two, one. (Switches flush. Meatloaf hits ceiling.)\nSheldon: Fascinating.\nRaj: What do you think the problem is?\nHoward: Not enough bread crumbs.\nScene: The comic book store.\nLeonard: Hey, Stuart, I need to talk to you.\nStuart: Sure, what\u2019s up?\nLeonard: I think I gave you bad advice about Penny, and I want to apologize.\nStuart: No, your advice was great.\nLeonard: It was?\nStuart: Yeah, going slow really worked.\nLeonard: You\u2019re kidding. Never worked for me.\nStuart: Yeah, last night at dinner, I did what you told me, I went really slow, I kept my distance, and two bottles of wine later, we were making out in my car.\nLeonard: Wine? I didn\u2019t say to give her wine.\nStuart: It doesn\u2019t matter, that\u2019s where it all went to hell.\nLeonard: During the kissing? What did you do, sneeze in her mouth? I did that to a girl once.\nStuart: No, everything was good and really hot, and I said \u201cOh, Penny,\u201d and right where she was supposed to say, \u201cOh, Stuart,\u201d she said\u2026 your name.\nLeonard: Leonard?\nStuart: That is your name, right?\nLeonard: Yeah, no, yeah, wow, I\u2019m sorry. That must\u2019ve been the last thing you wanted to hear.\nStuart: Well, it beats you know I\u2019m a dude, right? Yeah, it was pretty bad.\nLeonard: No doubt, no doubt. Okay, well, I\u2019m sorry it didn\u2019t work out.\nStuart: Not your fault.\nLeonard: Yeah, how about that? See you soon.\nStuart: Yeah, sure.\nScene: The apartment. Howard is on the phone.\n \nHoward: Yes, sir, I understand classified. We\u2019ll keep it all classified, no one has to know but you and me.\nPenny: What\u2019s classified?\nLeonard: Howard\u2019s space toilet. I\u2019ll tell you later.\nHoward: Well, they\u2019ve deployed our solution. Let\u2019s just all hope it works.\nSheldon: I don\u2019t see why I have to worry. My career\u2019s not hanging in the balance. That was a joke. It\u2019s funny, because it\u2019s true.\nPenny: Leonard, could you pass the soy sauce, please?\nLeonard: I\u2019m sorry, were you talking to me?\nPenny: Yeah, I said Leonard.\nLeonard: Yes, you did, didn\u2019t you?\nPenny: What the hell is that?\nHoward: Meatloaf.\nLeonard: What was it doing on the ceiling?\nHoward: That\u2019s classified.\nScene: The International Space Station.\nVoice: Houston, International Space Station. We have a little situation up here. We\u2019d like to make an unscheduled space walk.\nHouston: ISS, Houston. Which crew members would be involved in this E.V.A.?\nISS voice: Houston, we\u2019d all like to step outside for a few minutes.\nHouston: ISS, I\u2019m afraid we can\u2019t authorize that.\nISS voice: Uh, Houston, this is more of an FYI call. We are basically out the door.\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "9_20": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The apartment (initially inside a virtual reality device)\nSheldon: It\u2019s nice to get back to nature. Why don\u2019t I do this more often? What a beautiful forest. Hello, little butterfly. What\u2019s your Na-oh!\nLeonard: Whatcha doing?\nSheldon: I was enjoying some virtual reality, until you ruined it with your actual face.\nPenny: What am I smelling?\nSheldon: Oh, it\u2019s car air freshener. I was simulating the smell of the forest.\nPenny: That\u2019s not what the forest smells like.\nSheldon: Well, how would I know?\nLeonard: Why are you pretending to be outdoors? You hate it.\nSheldon: Hmm? Oh. Amy showed me a compelling study that demonstrated the cognitive benefit of spending time in the wilderness.\nLeonard: Buddy, I am ready to drive you into the wilderness any time you want and leave you there.\nSheldon: Well, make your jokes, but some of the participants who spent four days in the woods away from all technology reported a fifty percent gain in reasoning skills upon their return.\nPenny: Okay, if that\u2019s true, why aren\u2019t there more genius squirrels?\nSheldon: You may need this more than I do.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The apartment.\nAmy: Here\u2019s your tea.\nSheldon: Oh. Do not sneak up on a guy when he\u2019s sitting on a log.\nAmy: You know, if you really want to be in nature, why don\u2019t we rent a cabin?\nSheldon: Look, I\u2019m sorry, when did you even get here? I\u2026\nPenny: You know, there\u2019s a cabin in Big Bear that a doctor I work with keeps offering me.\nLeonard: Because he\u2019s hitting on you?\nPenny: She.\nLeonard: Oh, good.\nPenny: But I could get her.\nAmy: We could all go for the weekend. It\u2019ll be fun.\nSheldon: Excuse me. Here, look up fun, get back to me.\nLeonard: You and I could still go and have a nice weekend.\nPenny: Sure.\nAmy: Come on, Sheldon, let\u2019s go with them.\nSheldon: I hardly think so. You be sure and say hello to all the mosquitoes, bees, bears, snakes, possums, poison oak, oh, and last, but not least, teenagers with guitars.\nPenny: I\u2019ll see if it\u2019s available.\nAmy: You know, if that study\u2019s real, Leonard might come back smarter than you.\nSheldon: Are you trying to manipulate me?\nAmy: Yes.\nSheldon: Well done, it worked, we\u2019re going.\nAmy: Yay.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s house.\nBernadette: Come on, Raj, give me a bag.\nRaj: No, no, you\u2019re pregnant. The only thing you carry is our hope for a better tomorrow.\nHoward: Hey, where you been?\nBernadette: Uh, Raj took me to the baby doctor and then we swung by the grocery store.\nHoward: Did you get graham crackers? I mean, are, wuh, is the baby okay?\nBernadette: Yes and yes.\nHoward: I didn\u2019t know you needed help running errands today.\nBernadette: I didn\u2019t, but Raj volunteered.\nHoward: Really?\nBernadette: Yeah, ever since you told him I was pregnant, he\u2019s really been making a fuss over me.\nHoward: Oh. Well, I guess that\u2019s kind of sweet.\nRaj: Bernie, I just forwarded you a list of the top five lactation consultants in Los Angeles. I know my favourite, but I\u2019d love to hear what you think.\nHoward: And it just got weird.\nScene: The apartment.\nPenny: Hey. Amy\u2019s downstairs.\nLeonard: Okay, one sec.\nPenny: Uh, what, what you got goin\u2019 on here?\nLeonard: I bought a baseball cap.\nPenny: I can see that. What team did you get?\nLeonard: Uh, Hufflepuff, from Harry Potter.\nPenny: Well, we\u2019ll be in the woods.\nSheldon: I\u2019m ready to go.\nLeonard: Anything you\u2019d like to say to him?\nPenny: Nice hat, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Thanks.\nLeonard: Why are you so mean to me?\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s kitchen. Screams are emanating from Bernadette\u2019s tablet.\nHoward: What the hell are you watching?\nBernadette: Raj found all these childbirth videos online. This one is of a woman giving birth in a river.\nHoward: Okay, that is the least Jewish thing I\u2019ve ever seen in my life. You feel like Raj is getting a little carried away with all the baby stuff?\nBernadette: I don\u2019t think so. He just wants to be part of the experience.\nHoward: All right, if you say so. What\u2019s in the box?\nBernadette: Oh, it\u2019s an ultrasonic microphone so we can hear the baby\u2019s heartbeat.\nHoward: Oh. That\u2019s cool. Can we try it?\nBernadette: Actually, Raj ordered it. He made me promise to wait till he was here.\nHoward: So he can be part of the experience?\nBernadette: Yeah.\nHoward: I\u2019m surprised he let us conceive without him.\nBernadette: It\u2019s a sore spot, don\u2019t bring it up.\nScene: Leonard\u2019s car.\nPenny: It\u2019s so cute and rustic up here.\nLeonard: I know. Did you see they still have a video rental place? it\u2019s like Colonial Williamsburg.\nSheldon: Well, cell service is down to one bar, so if anyone needs medical attention or to tell a stranger their political views are stupid, now\u2019s the time.\nAmy: Have you ever been off the grid before?\nSheldon: Once. The battery ran out on my phone. I had to wait for my iPad to turn on.\nLeonard: I was afraid he was gonna eat me.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s apartment.\nHoward: Raj just pulled up. I\u2019m gonna say something to him.\nBernadette: Leave it alone. He means well.\nHoward: So you don\u2019t think he needs to rein it in a little?\nBernadette: No, not really.\nHoward: And you\u2019re not concerned he\u2019s acting like somehow this is his kid, too?\nBernadette: He\u2019s just trying to be supportive.\nHoward: Just supportive. Not over-the-top in any way?\nBernadette: No.\nRaj: Hello.\nBernadette: You saw him carrying that.\nHoward: Astronauts saw him carrying that.\nScene: The cabin. \nPenny: This place is great.\nLeonard: So nice of that doctor to just let you use it.\nPenny: Well, she is taking me to an Indigo Girls concert, so hold that thought.\nSheldon: Okay. Well, shall we check each other for ticks?\nAmy: Sheldon, all we did was walk in from the car.\nSheldon: Oh. Well, suit yourself. Who wants to check me?\nAmy: On the other hand, safety first.\nScene: The same, later.\nAmy: Wow, it\u2019s really coming down.\nPenny: This sucks.\nLeonard: And there goes our hike.\nSheldon: Oh, not our hike, now we have to stay safe and warm.\nPenny: You know, we could still go. A little rain isn\u2019t gonna kill us.\nLeonard: Have you been outside in the rain with Sheldon?\nPenny: No.\nLeonard: You\u2019ll wish it would kill you.\nAmy: So what do we do now?\nLeonard: They have some board games.\nSheldon: Eh, most of the Jenga pieces are missing and the Scrabble only has seven tiles, so unless you want to build an unimpressive structure with the word shnerpf next to it, move on.\nPenny: Hey, let\u2019s light a fire.\nAmy: Ooh, that sounds cozy.\nLeonard: I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve lit a real fire before.\nSheldon: Ah, it\u2019s basic thermodynamics. I\u2019m sure we can figure that out.\nLeonard: I could stack the logs conically to facilitate airflow.\nSheldon: That would maximize oxygen for optimal combustion.\nLeonard: Right. So all we need is to\u2026\nPenny: Got it.\nLeonard: A scientist made that.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s house.\nHoward: Look, Raj, you\u2019re my best friend in the world and I really appreciate your enthusiasm about the baby.\nRaj: Please, my pleasure.\nBernadette: And, of course, Howie and I both want you to be a part of all this.\nHoward: But we have to set some boundaries.\nRaj: I don\u2019t understand.\nHoward: The three of us aren\u2019t having this baby. Just the two of us.\nHoward: Oh. Okay. Yeah, I get it. I\u2019ll back off.\nHoward: Thanks for understanding.\nRaj: Of course. I\u2019ll give you guys some space. Let me just get this out of your way.\nHoward: You need some help?\nRaj: No, I got it.\nBernadette: Raj, Raj, wait.\nRaj: Please, Bernadette. Let me leave with my dignity.\nScene: The cabin.\nPenny: Hey, you guys want to play a drinking game?\nSheldon: Oh, well now, we\u2019ll never win. You always play the drinking game.\nPenny: Not the drinking game, a drinking game.\nLeonard: To be fair, good at both.\nAmy: What\u2019s the game?\nPenny: All right, it\u2019s called Never Have I Ever. The rules are simple. Someone says something they\u2019ve never done, but if you have done it, you take a drink.\nLeonard: I\u2019ve never played that before.\nSheldon: Hey, now, wait. Have we started? Do I drink? What is happening?\nPenny: Okay. Calm down. I\u2019ll go first. All right, let\u2019s see. Never have I ever\u2026\nAmy: She\u2019s trying to think of something she\u2019s never done before. This could take a while.\nPenny: Very funny. Okay, never have I ever\u2026 yeah, you know what? Let\u2019s just circle back.\nLeonard: Okay, I\u2019ll go. Never have I ever been arrested.\nSheldon: So I drink.\nAmy: No, it\u2019s only if you\u2019ve done it.\nSheldon: Got it.\nAmy: I can\u2019t believe you\u2019ve been arrested.\nSheldon: I can\u2019t believe Penny hasn\u2019t.\nPenny: Sheldon, what did you do?\nSheldon: Well, I\u2019m not proud of it, but I jaywalked.\nLeonard: Oh, no, it\u2019s like a horror movie. We\u2019re trapped in a cabin with a maniac.\nAmy: I\u2019m surprised you would do that.\nSheldon: No, I crossed in the middle of the street. And normally, I wouldn\u2019t, but I saw an aggressive-looking Girl Scout, and it was the heart of cookie season. Anyway, there was a police officer, and he witnessed the whole thing.\nPenny: What, he arrested you for that?\nSheldon: No, he didn\u2019t do anything. So I said, you just saw me jaywalk, why aren\u2019t you doing your job? You know? May, maybe I should arrest you for, for impersonating a police officer.\nPenny: And then you got arrested.\nSheldon: Oh, and how.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s house.\nHoward: I feel like I just made a horrible mistake.\nBernadette: Yeah.\nHoward: But on the other hand, I didn\u2019t kick him out of our lives. I just asked him to back off a little.\nBernadette: Yeah.\nHoward: What? Are you gonna cry?\nBernadette: Yeah.\nHoward: Is it baby hormones or actually sad?\nBernadette: I can\u2019t tell anymore.\nHoward: I\u2019ll go get him.\nBernadette: And bring back the bear.\nScene: The cabin. \nLeonard: This game\u2019s dangerous. I could get you in trouble.\nPenny: How?\nLeonard: Well, never have I ever used Sheldon\u2019s toothbrush to clean the sink.\nPenny: Fine, is that how you want to play this? All right, never have I ever come up with a nickname for my own genitals.\nLeonard: Never should\u2019ve told you about Alvin and the Chipmunks.\nAmy: Okay. My turn. Um, never have I ever completely rocked my girlfriend\u2019s world in bed.\nSheldon: Amy.\nAmy: You know the rules. Drink.\nPenny: Yeah, go ahead.\nLeonard: That\u2019s right.\nSheldon: All right, my turn. Mm. Oh, I know. Never have I ever kept a secret bank account, because I think my wife can\u2019t handle money. Did I win? I feel like I won.\nPenny: I can\u2019t believe this. You realize I make more money than you?\nLeonard: I don\u2019t, I know, but this isn\u2019t a big deal. It\u2019s just a little savings I put aside.\nPenny: We\u2019re married. We\u2019re supposed to share everything.\nLeonard: What, you mean, like, your massive credit card debt?\nSheldon: I\u2019m calling it. I won.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s house.\nRaj: I appreciate the apology, but it\u2019s really not necessary. I overstepped my bounds.\nHoward: No, Raj, you\u2019ve been great. I just, I need to start doing my part around here.\nBernadette: I hear that.\nRaj: Well, if that\u2019s the case, is there anything I can do to help?\nHoward: Well, not right now. But we could try out that microphone you got us, and listen to the baby\u2019s heartbeat.\nRaj: Really? It\u2019s okay if I listen with you?\nBernadette: Of course.\nRaj: Can I squirt the ultrasound jelly on your stomach?\nHoward: Hey, look at that. It\u2019s weird again.\nScene: The cabin.\nLeonard: Okay, you have every right to be mad. And what you said is true. You do make more money than me. So I had no right to do what I did. And I\u2019m so sorry. I hope you can forgive me.\nPenny: How long have you had this secret account?\nLeonard: A couple years, but I just put a few bucks aside every month for emergencies.\nPenny: Well, how much you got in there?\nLeonard: Six thousand four hundred and twenty seven dollars. Forty seven dollars once my nana\u2019s birthday check gets here.\nPenny: My God, Leonard, do you know what I could do with that kind of money?\nLeonard: No, I do, and that\u2019s why I hid it.\nPenny: What good is it if you don\u2019t use it?\nLeonard: Uh, you have shoes you love, but never wear. I have money I love, but never spend. We\u2019re kind of a cute couple that way. Again, I\u2019m sorry. I shouldn\u2019t have kept it a secret.\nPenny: Well, I have a secret I\u2019ve been keeping from you, too.\nLeonard: Is it a secret bank account? Because that would be awesome.\nPenny: I hate my job.\nLeonard: Really? Why?\nPenny: Because I don\u2019t feel good flirting with doctors for sales. I mean, I know I make a lot of money. But I haven\u2019t been happy for a while.\nLeonard: Why didn\u2019t you tell me?\nPenny: Because I know how important it is to you that I\u2019m having some success.\nLeonard: That\u2019s not true.\nPenny: Okay, really? So you\u2019d be fine if I went back to acting and waiting tables again?\nLeonard: If that\u2019s what you want to do, yes.\nPenny: Well, it\u2019s not what I want to do.\nLeonard: Oh, yes.\nPenny: Doesn\u2019t matter what I want. Look, this job is gonna get me out of debt. So I\u2019m gonna do the grown-up thing and see it through.\nLeonard: Well, that is the grown-up thing.\nPenny: I guess.\nLeonard: I love you.\nPenny: I love you, too.\nLeonard: You know, never have I ever made love in the forest while it was raining.\nPenny: Well, guess I gotta drink.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s house.\nHoward: All right, here we go.\nBernadette: I\u2019m not hearing anything.\nHoward: Well, give me a second.\nRaj: Are you sure you can do this?\nHoward: Hey, who found four dollars and change on the beach with his metal detector?\nRaj: I buried it there, so we could go home.\nBernadette: Wait, that\u2019s it.\nRaj: Wow.\nBernadette: Isn\u2019t that the best?\nRaj: You guys made a person.\nHoward: We did.\nRaj: And I like to think I helped.\nHoward: You didn\u2019t.\nScene: The cabin. \nSheldon: Oh, never have I ever drunk milk past its expiration date.\nAmy: Never have I ever cancelled a dentist appointment.\nSheldon: Oh, uh, never have I ever put my foot in the ocean.\nAmy: Never have I ever honked if I liked anything.\nSheldon: Oh, uh, never have I ever thrown, caught or touched a Frisbee.\nAmy: Never have I ever put salt on my food without trying it first.\nSheldon: Oh. Never have I ever pushed all the buttons in an elevator.\nAmy: Well, we all have a past.\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "4_17": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The apartment. Sheldon is on the phone.\nSheldon: Buona sera, Luigi\u2019s Pizza. Buona sera. It means good evening in Italian. May I say, having to explain that to you calls into question the authenticity of your ristorante?\nLeonard: Okay, I\u2019m out of here.\nSheldon: Un momento. Oh, for heaven\u2019s sake, now you\u2019re being deliberately stupid. (to Leonard) Where are you going?\nLeonard: I\u2019m having dinner with Priya at Raj\u2019s. I think Howard\u2019s going to be there. You want to join us?\nSheldon: But tonight\u2019s Thursday. On Thursdays, everybody comes over here and has pizza. Or a reasonable facsimile prepared by someone claiming to be Luigi, but who sounds suspiciously like Jackie Chan.\nLeonard: Can\u2019t we make a one-time exception for tonight?\nSheldon: We could. We could also stop using the letter M, but I think that idea is isguided and oronic.\nLeonard: Just come with me to Raj\u2019s.\nSheldon: Well, I don\u2019t want to go to a party.\nLeonard: It\u2019s not a party. It\u2019s the same group of people who hang out here, hanging out over there.\nSheldon: I\u2019m sorry, but five people eating and chatting is a party.\nLeonard: How come it\u2019s not a party when we do it here?\nSheldon: Because we don\u2019t throw parties.\nLeonard: I don\u2019t know what to tell you, Sheldon. I\u2019m going to see Priya. Everyone\u2019s over there. You coming or not?\nSheldon: Well, no, sir, and do you know why? In a word, tradition. Every Thursday night for the last eight years, you and I and our friends have gathered here in this very spot to break bread covered with cheese and sauce, discuss the issues of the day, and yes, share a laugh or two. But I guess our rich heritage means nothing to you.\nLeonard: I guess you\u2019re right. See you later.\nSheldon: Wait! Leonard! Wait! What am I going to do for dinner?\nLeonard: Come with me to Raj\u2019s and eat there.\nSheldon: I can\u2019t do that. What if he serves haggis and blood pudding?\nLeonard: I really doubt that\u2019s what he\u2019ll serve.\nSheldon: But what if he does? I\u2019ll be obliged to dine on liver and lungs stuffed in a sheep\u2019s stomach. And frankly, blood pudding is essentially the same thing. I don\u2019t know why he\u2019s serving both.\nLeonard: What do you want to do? You want to come with me, or do you want to sit here alone?\nSheldon: No, I\u2019ll go to your haggis party. But I\u2019m telling you, this is adness. This is utter and coplete adness.\nCredits sequence. \nSheldon: Oh, dear!\nLeonard: What?\nSheldon: Raj\u2019s television. I just realized we\u2019re about to spend an evening watching a plasma screen with a cluster of dead pixels in the upper left-hand corner.\nLeonard: So don\u2019t watch TV. Read a book.\nSheldon: And be a social pariah? Oh, you know that\u2019s not my style.\nLeonard: Ugh!\nSheldon: The audible sigh is a show of exasperation, right?\nLeonard: Right.\nSheldon: Is it about me or the dead pixels?\nRaj: Hey, you\u2019re just in time. We made Tex-Mex.\nLeonard: Oh, sounds great.\nSheldon: Oh, Indians making Tex-Mex. Might as well have had the Chinese pizza.\nPriya: Hey, you.\nLeonard: Hi.\nHoward: That\u2019s got to be fun for you, huh? Watching Hofstadter suck the saliva out of your sister\u2019s mouth?\nSheldon: Excuse me. Before this evening goes any further, we need to decide where everyone is going to sit.\nPriya: There is no assigned seats, Sheldon. Just sit anywhere. Make yourself comfortable.\nSheldon: Oh, what fun. We\u2019re like hippies at a love-in.\nLeonard: Just sit here.\nSheldon: Yeah, right on, man. Right on. Oh, look, it\u2019s Harry Potter and 98% of The Sorcerer\u2019s Stone.\nRaj: Okay, we\u2019ve got fajitas with all the fixins, so you make your own.\nSheldon: Wonderful. Dinner, some assembly required.\nPriya: Do you want a margarita, Sheldon?\nSheldon: A margarita? Where are we? What is happening?\nScene: The bar of the Cheesecake Factory\nPenny: Oh. Hey, Sheldon. What can I get ya?\nSheldon: Water. Neat. With a little umbrella.\nPenny: Where are all your friends?\nSheldon: Sadly, Penny, this evening, I am the Dark Knight, roaming these mean streets alone. A windbreaker for my cape, and a stern expression for my cowl.\nPenny: Okay.\nSheldon: Excuse me? Isn\u2019t this the point where the world-weary barkeep absentmindedly wipes down the bar and coaxes the woes out of the troubled patron?\nPenny: Well, I was getting your stupid umbrella, but all right. What\u2019s troubling you, buddy?\nSheldon: I don\u2019t think your heart\u2019s in it, but since you asked. Apparently, because Leonard is dating Raj\u2019s sister, we\u2019re all forced to hang out at his apartment.\nPenny: Oh, the horror.\nSheldon: Indeed. Yeah, at one point, Raj put on reggae music, and his sister took off her shoes. It was like the last days of Caligula. (Phone rings) Oh, I have to get this. Umbrella?\nPenny: Ugh!\nSheldon: Wonder what she\u2019s exasperated about. Hello?\nAmy (on phone): Sheldon, are you all right? When last we spoke, you were going to take a taxi home from Raj\u2019s, but according to Facebook, you just checked in at the Cheesecake Factory.\nSheldon: Yes, I was in a taxi, but the driver didn\u2019t look at all like the photograph on his license, so I leapt out and ran for it.\nAmy: Wise.\nPenny: There you go. Just like recovering alcoholics drink in the Caribbean.\nAmy: Hi, bestie.\nPenny: Oh. Hi, Amy. How you been?\nAmy: Fine. From this angle, I can see up your nose.\nPenny: Yeah, it\u2019s a great time to be alive, isn\u2019t it?\nSheldon: Don\u2019t worry. My problems can wait while you two hens finish your clucking.\nPenny: Look, Sheldon, Leonard is dating Priya. She is staying with Raj. That means you\u2019re all probably gonna be hanging out there more.\nAmy: Penny, I\u2019m sorry you got dragged into this. I know you\u2019re devastated that your ex-boyfriend has found an exciting new lover with flawless, caramel-coloured skin.\nPenny: Okay, I\u2019m not upset about Leonard and Priya.\nAmy: Your flaring nostrils indicate otherwise.\nSheldon: Cluck-cluck-cluck.\nAmy: Sheldon, look at me. I think it\u2019s time to face the fact that Leonard is the nucleus of your social group. Where he goes, the group goes.\nSheldon: Leonard the nucleus? That makes no sense. I\u2019m the whimsical elf that everyone looks to for a good time.\nAmy: I\u2019m not saying that you\u2019re not fun. You\u2019re the most fun person I know.\nPenny: A lot of people think I\u2019m fun to be around.\nAmy: Don\u2019t be needy, bestie. That\u2019s probably part of what chased Leonard away. What I am saying, Sheldon, is that your group is Leonard-centric. If it were a town, it would be Leonardville. If it were an Islamic nation, Leonardstan. If it were the birthplace of motion pictures, we\u2019d all be singing Hooray for Leonardwood.\nPenny: Ooh, I got one. If you guys were a band, you\u2019d be called Leonard and the Leonards.\nAmy: So needy.\nScene: The apartment. \nLeonard: What you doing?\nSheldon: I\u2019m setting out snacks.\nLeonard: You do realize everyone\u2019s eating at Raj\u2019s again tonight?\nSheldon: I didn\u2019t say the snacks were for you now, did I, Nosy Rosie?\nLeonard: You\u2019re having people over?\nSheldon: Yes. Must be killing you wondering who. Fine, I\u2019ll tell you. Stuart from the comic bookstore, Barry Kripke from the university, Penny\u2019s ex-boyfriend Zack and TV\u2019s LeVar Burton.\nLeonard: Really? LeVar Burton\u2019s coming here?\nSheldon: Possibly. I Tweeted him.\nLeonard: Okay, well, tell him I loved him on Star Trek.\nSheldon: Please, Leonard, stop trying to horn in on my new friends.\nLeonard: Of course. Good night.\nSheldon: Leonard.\nLeonard: Yeah?\nSheldon: We had a good run, you and I.\nLeonard: Okay.\nSheldon: But change is a part of life.\nLeonard: It certainly is.\nSheldon: Okay. I have guests coming. I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m going to have to ask you to leave now.\nLeonard: I am leaving.\nSheldon: Don\u2019t make this harder than it is, Leonard.\nLeonard: Good-bye, Sheldon.\nSheldon: And good-bye to you, sir. He\u2019ll be back.\nLeonard: Of course I\u2019ll be back. I live here!\nScene: The apartment, later. \nSheldon: Well, it would appear LeVar Burton won\u2019t be joining us so let\u2019s get started. Um, I thought we\u2019d begin by going around the room, introducing ourselves and saying a little bit about why we\u2019re here. Okay. I\u2019m Sheldon. Uh, for regular readers of The New England Journal of High Energy Physics, I need no introduction. If you\u2019re not familiar with that publication, there\u2019s a free copy in your goody bag. Stuart?\nStuart: Um. Hi. I\u2019m Stuart. I run a comic bookstore, which for financial reasons, I\u2019m currently living in. And I guess what I\u2019m hoping for most out of tonight is a hot shower.\nSheldon: That\u2019s very nice, Stuart. Zack?\nZack: I\u2019m Zack, and I\u2019m, uh\u2026 uh\u2026 could you come back to me?\nSheldon: Of course. Barry?\nBarry: I\u2019m Barry Kwipke, and I\u2019m here because you told me there was going to be a whaffle. When is the whaffle?\nSheldon: Patience, patience, Barry. The whaffle\u2026 the raffle is the grand finale to an evening-long festival of fun and folly.\nBarry: One more question\u2026\nSheldon: Yes, you must be present to win.\nZack: Okay, I\u2019m ready. I\u2019m Zack, and I\u2019m, uh\u2026 oh, crap, why is this so hard?\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment.\nPenny: Oh, hey.\nBernadette: Hi.\nAmy: Yo, P-dog.\nPenny: What\u2019s up?\nBernadette: We\u2019re here to kidnap you for a girls\u2019 night out.\nAmy: Parenthetical, the term kidnap is being used playfully.\nPenny: I kind of figured that.\nAmy: Good. Now put this pillowcase over your head.\nPenny: No.\nAmy: She used to be much more fun, until Leonard punched her in the heart.\nBernadette: We just thought you might want to go out and have a good time, maybe go dancing.\nPenny: Oh. Gee, thanks, but I\u2019m not really in the mood.\nAmy: You do understand that it will distract you from obsessing over the rich variety of sweet loving that your ex-boyfriend is currently receiving from the fiery jewel of Mumbai.\nPenny: Okay, look, if I agree to go out with you guys, will you promise to stop pestering me about Leonard and Priya?\nAmy: Yes.\nBernadette: Sure.\nPenny: All right. I\u2019ll go change. Come on in.\nAmy: If you\u2019d have let me bring the chloroform, we wouldn\u2019t have had to put up with all this jibber-jabber.\nScene: The apartment. \nZack: Anyway, after we get done snowboarding, I go back to the lodge and get in the Jacuzzi. There\u2019s no one around, so naturally, I\u2019m free-balling it. Next thing I know, this beautiful chick shows up, drunk out of her skull, wants to get in with me.\nSheldon: Question. Was it a Jacuzzi or a hot tub?\nBarry: Weally? That\u2019s your question?\nZack: What\u2019s the difference?\nSheldon: Jacuzzi is a commercial brand. Hot tub is the generic term, i.e., all Jacuzzis are hot tubs, but not all hot tubs are Jacuzzis.\nZack: Is that like all thumbs are fingers, but not all fingers are thumbs?\nSheldon: Surprisingly, yes.\nZack: Nice. Now, what exactly are toes?\nStuart: Can you please get back to the drunk girl? I\u2019d like something to think about in the shower.\nZack: Oh, yeah. Right. Anyway, she takes off all of her clothes, climbs into the hot tub, and the first thing I notice\u2026\nSheldon: The water level rose.\nZack: No.\nSheldon: Of course it did. It\u2019s said that Archimedes, the ancient Greek mathematician, discovered the principle of displacement while taking a bath.\nBarry: Tewwific. Go ahead, Zack. Naked dwunk girl, fwee-balling, continue.\nSheldon: Forgive me, but I think you\u2019ll find my story is more interesting.\nBarry: Does yours have wet bweasts in it?\nSheldon: Better. It has a gold crown. You see, the king wondered how much gold was in it and charged Archimedes with coming up with the solution. Because the crown was irregularly shaped, there was no way to mathematically determine its volume. But, while bathing, Archimedes realized he could immerse the crown and measure the amount the water rose.\nZack: So, long story short, I nailed her.\nSheldon: When he finished, he shouted Eureka!\nZack: No, I always shout, Holy Moly! Don\u2019t know why. Just do.\nSheldon: All right, that concludes the getting to know you portion of the evening. Who\u2019s ready to play some vintage video games? And tonight\u2019s selections include ColecoVision\u2019s Smurf Rescue in Gargamel\u2019s Castle, Atari\u2019s Cookie Monster Munch, and for you text adventure aficionados, Zork. Pick me, pick me. I\u2019m fun.\nBarry: That all sucks the big haiwy meatball. How about I go get the kawaoke machine out of my car, get plastered and blow the woof off this place?\nZack: Great, I\u2019ll make a beer run.\nStuart: And I\u2019ll take a shower. We\u2019ll meet back here in fifteen.\nBarry: Check.\nSheldon: I\u2019m unhappy.\nScene: Raj\u2019s apartment. \nLeonard: This is delicious. Where\u2019d you learn to make chili?\nPriya: When I was at university in England, my flatmate was from Texas.\nLeonard: I hope she wasn\u2019t anything like my flatmate from Texas.\nPriya: Sheldon is a bit quirky, isn\u2019t he?\nHoward: Oh, please. That crazy bastard\u2019s looking at quirky in the rearview mirror.\nLeonard: Did you know that, per our roommate agreement, I have to wash my feet before I get in the shower? And not in the sink. We each have special buckets.\nHoward: Raj, did you ever tell your sister about the time Sheldon got punched by Bill Gates?\nPriya: Oh, God, you\u2019re kidding.\nRaj: Nope. Gates gave a speech at the university. Sheldon went up to him afterwards and said, maybe if you weren\u2019t so distracted by sick children in Africa, you could have put a little more thought into Windows Vista.\u201d\nLeonard: Bam. Right in the nose. Made me proud to own a PC.\nRaj: I\u2019d like to propose a toast to a rare and wonderful Sheldon-free evening.\nLeonard: Hear, hear.\nHoward: Cheers. You realize that\u2019s the first time we\u2019ve ever done that without having to listen to Sheldon tell us why it\u2019s called a toast?\nPriya: Why is it called a toast?\nLeonard: Oh, the ancient Romans put spiced toast in their punch bowls.\nRaj: Sheldon tells it better.\nLeonard: He kind of does.\nHoward: Yeah.\nLeonard: Aw, hell, I miss him.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment. \nPenny: So, where do you guys want to go dancing?\nBernadette: We were hoping you\u2019d know a place.\nAmy: Yes, perhaps somewhere packed tightly with young, beautiful bodies sweating and writhing against each other in a glorious orgy of the flesh.\nPenny: Oh, yeah, I know that place. What do you think?\nAmy: That should display enough of your bosom to attract a new mate, or a hungry infant.\nPenny: Okay, let\u2019s go through this one more time. Just because Leonard has a new girlfriend does not mean I need to go out and hook up with some guy.\nBernadette: But you could if you wanted to, right?\nPenny: Well, yeah, I guess.\nBernadette: Pick out the hottest guy in the room, take him home, do unspeakable things to him, then kick him to the curb with a smile on his face and teeth marks on his heinie?\nPenny: More or less.\nAmy: What\u2019s that like?\nPenny: I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s fun while you\u2019re doing it. And then after, it\u2019s mostly embarrassment, self-loathing and regret.\nBernadette: I would take that deal all day long.\nPenny: Yeah, well, it\u2019s not gonna happen tonight. You know, for the first time in my life, I am not in a relationship, and I\u2019m totally okay with it.\nAmy: You know, if being on your own is new to you, I\u2019d be happy to share some tension-relieving techniques for ladies I\u2019ve perfected over the years. For example, do you have an electric toothbrush?\nPenny: Um, no.\nAmy: You should get one.\nBernadette: What\u2019s that?\nAmy: It appears to be something preserved between two pieces of acrylic.\nPenny: Oh, it\u2019s a snowflake from the North Pole. Leonard gave it to me last year.\nBernadette: Oh, God, that is so romantic.\nPenny: Yeah, it was.\nBernadette: Leonard\u2019s really one of a kind.\nAmy: Saying that while holding a snowflake is a little bit heavy-handed, don\u2019t you think?\nPenny: Let me see that. Oh, screw it. I can deal with a little self-loathing. Let\u2019s go find me a heinie to bite.\nAmy: Outstanding. And if we fail, we can always stop at CVS and pick you out a nice toothbrush. I call mine Gerard.\nBernadette: That\u2019s kind of creepy.\nScene: The apartment. Barry and Zack are singing \u201cDon\u2019t Go Breaking My Heart\u201d\n \nStuart: Anybody do Walking on Sunshine yet?\nSheldon: No.\nStuart: Dibs.\nScene: Raj\u2019s apartment. \nPriya: I\u2019m sorry, Sheldon bought a loom and learned how to weave?\nLeonard: He actually got pretty good. He made us all matching serapes.\nRaj: I still wear mine when there\u2019s a nip in the air.\nPriya: Now, was this before or after he adopted the 25 cats?\nLeonard: Long before the cats. I think it was around the time he tried to declare our apartment a sovereign nation. I still have some of the currency.\nSheldon (outside): (Knock, knock, knock) All my friends. (Knock, knock, knock) All my friends. (Knock, knock, knock) All my friends.\nHoward: I think it\u2019s like Beetlejuice. We said his name too many times.\nRaj: Come on in.\nSheldon: Thank you.\nLeonard: Hey. I thought you were with your new buddies.\nSheldon: I had to leave. They were having fun wrong.\nPriya: Come here, Sheldon. Sit here with me.\nSheldon: Thank you.\nPriya: Would you like some homemade chili?\nSheldon: Are there beans in it?\nPriya: Yes.\nSheldon: Then it\u2019s not chili. Real chili has no beans in it, but you\u2019re from a foreign land, so your ignorance is forgiven.\nPriya: Sheldon, do you want some or not?\nSheldon: Yes, please. Your girlfriend\u2019s a little short-tempered.\nRaj: I\u2019d like to propose a toast to friends, no matter how quirky.\nAll: Cheers.\nSheldon: Priya, do you know why this is called a toast?\nPriya: Actually, I do. I believe the Romans used to put spiced toast in their punch bowls.\nSheldon: She\u2019s also a bit of a know-it-all. Mmm. This is good. Whatever it is.\nScene: The apartment. Stuart is singing \u201cWalking on Sunshine\u201d. Barry and Zack are doing backing vocals. \n \nLeVar Burton: Hello? I\u2026 Oh, I don\u2019t think so. I am so done with Twitter.\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "8_13": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: Okay, we\u2019re headed out, see you later.\nSheldon: Before you leave, could you test these noise-cancelling headphones?\nLeonard: Yeah, sure.\nSheldon: Okay. Go ahead.\nLeonard: Hello, can you hear me? Sheldon, I haven\u2019t changed the filter in the water pitcher in two years.\nPenny: Uh, Bernadette\u2019s nickname for you is the virgin pi\u00f1a colada.\nLeonard: Your George Lucas autograph is really a me autograph.\nPenny: Yeah, once I was too lazy to walk across the hall, so I used your toothbrush.\nLeonard: Ooh, and one time when you were asleep, Amy totally took off her\u2026 and that\u2019s why you\u2019re the best roommate ever.\nSheldon: Aw, now I\u2019m sad I didn\u2019t hear it.\nPenny: So what do you need the headphones for?\nSheldon: Well, I\u2019ve been struggling for months to come up with a theory of dark matter that doesn\u2019t make protons decay. I\u2019m hoping to finally tackle it by optimising my work environment. See, I\u2019ve got, uh, my tea is at the perfect sipping temperature. Uh, I have fleece-lined boxer shorts to keep my tushie toasty. And then, oh, last but not least, this inspirational cat poster improved with the reassuring face of physics renegade Richard Feynman.\nPenny: Is that why you had to take him to Office Depot last night?\nLeonard: I don\u2019t want to talk about it. There, the place is all yours.\nPenny: Yeah, have fun.\nSheldon: Oh, I will, nothing more fun than a paradigm-shifting evening of science.\nPenny: And you thought it was soaping me up in the shower.\nLeonard: Bye.\nSheldon: Okay. Here we go. Proton decay. Proton decay. (Time shift) Proton decay. Proton decay. (Time shift) Proton decay. Proton decay.\nLeonard: Hey, we\u2019re home. Any progress?\nSheldon: How could there be, with these constant interruptions?\nPenny: I love him, but if he\u2019s broken, let\u2019s not get a new one.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The apartment. \nLeonard: What are you doing? It\u2019s time to go.\nSheldon: I\u2019m not going to work today. And would you like to know why?\nLeonard: Ah, you\u2019re upset because you spent the whole night working on dark matter and didn\u2019t make a breakthrough, and now you\u2019re worried you made a huge mistake switching fields, and you\u2019re gonna sit around and sulk all day?\nSheldon: Like a big old baby.\nLeonard: Call me if you need anything.\nSheldon: I\u2019ve been cooped up in here too long. Maybe I need some fresh air.\nPenny (off): Ugh! Ugh! Ugh! Ugh! \nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Penny?\nPenny (off): Ugh!\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Penny?\nPenny (off): Ugh!\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Penny?\nPenny: Ugh, what?\nSheldon: You sounded in distress. I was worried something unpleasant was happening to you. Like a murder. Or spontaneous coitus with Leonard.\nPenny: Oh, I\u2019m just doing this awful workout. I hate it.\nSheldon: Well, if you hate it, then why are you doing it? Although I could ask the same question about coitus with Leonard.\nPenny: I don\u2019t know, I guess I like that I hate it. It makes me work harder.\nSheldon: And to clarify?\nPenny: The exercise, Sheldon. Shouldn\u2019t you be getting ready for work?\nSheldon: I\u2019m not going. Would you like to know why?\nPenny: Uh, you\u2019re sad about not getting anything done last night, so you\u2019re gonna sit around and pout about it?\nSheldon: Boy, I\u2019m not nearly as mysterious as I think I am.\nScene: The cafeteria.\nHoward: I invented a game. You want to play?\nLeonard: Sure.\nHoward: It\u2019s called Emily or Cinnamon. I give you actual quotes I\u2019ve heard Raj say, and you guess if he was talking to his girlfriend or his dog.\nRaj: Go ahead, make fun. You can\u2019t embarrass me, I\u2019ve got a beautiful girlfriend and a dog who loves me so much she drinks my bathwater.\nHoward: Okay, who was he talking to, Emily or Cinnamon? I want you to know, the bed feels so lonely when you\u2019re not in it.\nRaj: I may not be liking this game so much.\nLeonard: Cinnamon. Give me another one.\nHoward: Okay, Emily or Cinnamon? Check it out, I got us matching sweaters.\nLeonard: We all got the Christmas card, Cinnamon.\nRaj: You know, a man can care deeply about a woman and a pet. It\u2019s not strange.\nLeonard: Ooh, Emily. I heard him say that to Emily. Hey, I thought you were staying home.\nSheldon: Yeah, I was, but after talking to Penny, I realised something. I, first, she\u2019s trying much harder to stay attractive in this relationship than you are. And second, the reason I may not be progressing in my research is I\u2019ve created too pleasant of an environment for myself.\nHoward: What do you mean?\nSheldon: According to a classic psychological experiment by Yerkes and Dodson, in order to maximize performance, one must create a state of productive anxiety. So I\u2019d like to ask you all to do something for me. Keep me on my toes. Just throw me off my game. Essentially, go out of your way to make my life miserable.\nHoward: Hold on. What\u2019s in it for us?\nSheldon: Well, I suppose\u2026\nHoward: Okay, we\u2019ll do it.\nScene: Amy\u2019s laboratory.\nSheldon: Done.\nAmy: 33 seconds. Okay, that\u2019ll be our baseline.\nSheldon: You know, I don\u2019t want to tell you how to do your job, but when a mouse completes a maze, it gets a food pellet.\nAmy: It also gets its brain plucked out with tweezers.\nSheldon: And his last meal was a food pellet? You\u2019re a monster.\nAmy: All right, next, we\u2019re gonna introduce an anxiety-inducing stimulus, measure your stress levels and see how it affects your problem-solving rate.\nSheldon: Very well. And good luck, I\u2019m a pretty laid-back guy.\nAmy: Ready? Begin. Why\u2019d you pop it?\nSheldon: I\u2019m sorry, I was aiming for your heart.\nAmy: Look, I know you don\u2019t like it, but that\u2019s the point of the experiment. I need to irritate you to find your optimal anxiety zone. And you said no to tickling, polka music or watching me eat a banana.\nSheldon: Who eats them horizontally?\nAmy: My mother said that\u2019s how good girls do it.\nSheldon: Perhaps this was a waste of time.\nAmy: Sheldon, you\u2019re a remarkable scientist. Just be patient, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll find the breakthrough you\u2019ve been looking for.\nSheldon: Thank you.\nAmy: And if you only do solid research instead of making a groundbreaking discovery, what does it matter?\nSheldon: Only do solid research? I come to you for help, and you insult me? I thought the least that you would do would be\u2026\nAmy: Look, your anxiety levels are right in the zone.\nSheldon: Really? Oh, that\u2019s fantastic. Now, wait, they\u2019re dropping. Why are they dropping?\nAmy: Because you\u2019re happy they\u2019re elevated.\nSheldon: Oh, that is infuriating. Ooh, look, they went back up again. Terrific. Oh, no, they went back down.\nScene: The apartment.\nRaj: All right, guys, what game do you want to play?\nHoward: Let\u2019s see. How about Emily or Cinnamon?\nRaj: You know what? I think it\u2019s a little weird that you remember me saying all these things. Maybe the truth is, you\u2019re jealous of all my relationships.\nHoward: Oh, maybe I am. Who wouldn\u2019t want to be the girl, or possibly dog, to hear the words you\u2019re so lucky, you have the shiniest hair.\nLeonard: That is a tough one. Uh, I know he brushes both of them.\nSheldon: Gentlemen, I have figured out the perfect way for you to irritate me. I\u2019d like you to be my intellectual sparring partners. From now on, when I make an assertion, I need you to challenge it.\nLeonard: So you just want us to disagree with whatever you say?\nSheldon: Yes.\nRaj: And you think that\u2019s going to help?\nSheldon: Yes.\nHoward: Well, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s gonna help at all.\nSheldon: Oh, no, it will. See, by keeping my mind engaged, I\u2019ll become more focused.\nLeonard: Howard\u2019s right, that\u2019ll never work.\nSheldon: Stop fighting me on the premise. It\u2019s scientifically valid. I\u2019m going to advance propositions, I just want you to challenge me.\nRaj: I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what you want at all.\nSheldon: Why, of course it\u2019s what I want. Why would I say it\u2019s what I want if it\u2019s not what I want?\nLeonard: Because it is what you want, and it\u2019s not what you said.\nSheldon: I ask you for one simple thing, and you can\u2019t even do it.\nHoward: Yes, we can.\nSheldon: Yeah, well, then do it.\nHoward: Nah.\nSheldon: You guys are the worst. Thank you, I think that was helpful.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment. \nPenny: So, whichever rep has the best sales for the quarter gets a trip for two to Hawaii.\nAmy: That would be so romantic for you and Leonard.\nPenny: Yeah, clearly you haven\u2019t seen him on the beach walking around with his metal detector.\nAmy: If I were going to Hawaii, I\u2019d spend all my time at the Keck Observatory. Did you know that the telescopes there have better resolution than the Hubble?\nPenny: Really? Want to go to Hawaii?\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Ladies? (Knock, knock, knock) Ladies? (Knock, knock, knock) Ladies?\nPenny: Come in.\nSheldon: Ladies.\nPenny: What\u2019s up?\nSheldon: Well, as you may know, I\u2019ve been experimenting with elevated anxiety levels, and I thought, what better way to increase my discomfort than to subject myself to an evening of tasteless uncensored crotch talk?\nPenny: What exactly do you think goes on here?\nSheldon: Well, conversations that you wouldn\u2019t be comfortable having in front of the opposite sex. You know, who has the best cervix. Which sanitary napkin is all the rage right now. Men\u2019s buttocks, and how you want to pat and squeeze them.\nBernadette: We were talking about Penny\u2019s job.\nSheldon: And how difficult it is to do when she\u2019s bloated, cranky and crampy? Continue.\nPenny: Sheldon, we are just people. We talk about the same things you guys talk about.\nSheldon: You talk about if werewolves can swim? See, Leonard says yes, but I say it depends on if the human could swim before he was bitten. What do you think?\nPenny: Let\u2019s just talk about our periods.\nAmy: No, hold on. All canines instinctively know how to swim. Why wouldn\u2019t a werewolf have the same abilities?\nBernadette: Well, they\u2019re not a hundred percent wolf. They\u2019re a werewolf, that\u2019s only part wolf. It\u2019s like comparing apples to oranges.\nSheldon: Thank you. Oh, and technically, it\u2019s apples that turn into were-oranges when the moon is full. Hey, this is fun. We should do it sometime when you aren\u2019t all PMS\u2019ing. Bye.\nScene: The apartment. \nLeonard: What is going on?\nSheldon: Oh. Uh, I need to keep my anxiety at the right level, so I\u2019m using Darth Vader, the Joker, and Godzilla\u2019s roar to keep me in that sweet spot. Uh, I tried including Taylor Swift in the mix, but turns out I love her.\nLeonard: Well, at least listen to it through headphones. I\u2019m trying to sleep. Good night.\nSheldon: Boy, Taylor was right, haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate.\nScene: Amy\u2019s apartment.\nAmy: You\u2019ve been working so much lately, I\u2019m glad you didn\u2019t forget about date night.\nSheldon: Of course.\nAmy: Sheldon.\nSheldon: Yeah.\nAmy: Maybe you want to put the notebook away and talk to me.\nSheldon: I can do both. My brain is working at optimal capacity. I can have a conversation with you and solve the dark matter proton decay problem at the same time.\nAmy: Fine. How was your day?\nSheldon: Oh, you said it.\nAmy: Sheldon. Sheldon, I\u2019m worried about you. You\u2019re not eating, you haven\u2019t slept in days, and, to be honest, that cap is starting to smell.\nSheldon: I know. It\u2019s replaced Godzilla as my principle source of anxiety.\nScene: The apartment. \nHoward: Okay, so it\u2019s one vote Emily, one vote Cinnamon. Penny, you\u2019re the tiebreaker.\nPenny: Say the quote again.\nHoward: It\u2019s just so perfect that we\u2019re both Libras.\nPenny: Wow, this is hard. I\u2019m gonna say Cinnamon.\nHoward: Yes.\nPenny: Yes.\nRaj: Come on.\nHoward: That was the last one, I promise. We won\u2019t play any more.\nRaj: Thank you. \u2018Cause if she ever found out, it would hurt her feelings.\nBernadette: Emily\u2019s feelings?\nRaj: Yes, Emily. Whatever. Where\u2019s Sheldon?\nPenny: Date night.\nLeonard: That can\u2019t be much fun for Amy. You know, at work today, he tried his first Red Bull.\nBernadette: What happened?\nLeonard: He chased a squirrel around the quad for a while and then threw up in my car.\nBernadette: Don\u2019t you think you should make him stop all this?\nHoward: I don\u2019t know, he\u2019s not really hurting anybody.\nLeonard: You didn\u2019t have to scoop vomit out of your glove compartment.\nSheldon: He is getting a lot of work done. He had a pretty interesting take on proton decay.\nRaj: Wow, if he cracks that it\u2019s a game changer, guys. It\u2019ll completely redefine our understanding of the physical universe.\nHoward: Hmm, it would. Okay, back to Emily or Cinnamon? How can such a little girl eat such a big steak?\nScene: Amy\u2019s apartment.\nAmy: Sheldon, I want you to take that cap off.\nSheldon: That nagging tone is helping my anxiety, yeah. But if you could maybe just go ten percent less shrill, that\u2019d really put the zip-a-dee in my doo-dah.\nAmy: I\u2019m sorry, but you know we agreed not to bring work to date night.\nSheldon: There you go, perfect.\nAmy: Sheldon, stop it, I\u2019m not kidding. Take the cap off, and put the notebook away.\nSheldon: But after months of struggling, I\u2019m finally making progress.\nAmy: You don\u2019t need to drive yourself crazy in order to be productive.\nSheldon: Or do I, hmm? Sir Isaac Newton wrote his Principia while convinced he was an armadillo.\nAmy: That\u2019s not true.\nSheldon: Yeah, well, maybe it is, maybe it isn\u2019t. I have been hallucinating lately.\nAmy: Sheldon, this has to stop. You need to get some sleep and take care of yourself.\nSheldon: Amy, I have gotten more done in the last few days than I have since I made the switch to dark matter. What if I stop doing this, and it all goes away?\nAmy: Your thoughts and ideas come from you, not from your anxiety.\nSheldon: Hmm, perhaps. But I\u2019m not taking the cap off.\nAmy: It\u2019s one thing to make yourself miserable, but you\u2019re making everyone around you miserable, too. Now, I\u2019m telling you for the last time, take the cap off.\nSheldon: Oh, really? What if I don\u2019t? And before you answer that, can I have my dessert?\nScene: A bus.\nSheldon: And then she threw me out. Me, her very own boyfriend. When all I\u2019ve done is try to help humanity reach of the world we live in.\nMan: Yeah, well, women, what are you gonna do?\nSheldon: I knew you\u2019d understand, Armadillo Isaac Newton.\nScene: Sheldon\u2019s bedroom.\nPenny: Okay.\nLeonard: Here we are.\nSheldon: Hey. What are you trying to pull? The president of science isn\u2019t in here.\nLeonard: You lie down, he\u2019ll be here in a minute.\nSheldon: Okay. Hey, I thought you were trying to trick me.\nPenny: Now, you just get comfortable.\nSheldon: No, no, comfort is the enemy. You know what\u2019s comfortable? Slippers and blankets and panda bears. Imagine a panda bear with Richard Feynman\u2019s face on it. Warm up the car, Leonard, it\u2019s poster time.\nLeonard: Maybe in the morning.\nPenny: Yeah, you get some sleep.\nSheldon: No, I don\u2019t want to go to sleep, you can\u2019t make me.\nPenny: You\u2019re right, we can\u2019t.\nSheldon: Yeah, darn straight, you can\u2019t. Try to tell a grown man to go to sleep.\nPenny (singing): Soft kitty, warm kitty.\nLeonard (singing): Little ball of fur.\nSheldon: That\u2019s not gonna work.\nPenny (singing): Happy kitty, sleepy kitty.\nTogether (singing): Purr, purr, purr.\nLeonard: You know, he can be a lot of trouble, but when I see him lying here asleep like this, I just think how easy it would be to hold a pillow over his face.\nPenny: Mmmm.\nScene: The cafeteria.\nHoward: You look like you got some rest.\nSheldon: Oh, I\u2019m feeling much better. And I\u2019ve also been continuing to make progress without artificially raising my anxiety levels.\nLeonard: I turned on the heat in my car and some vomit came out, so my levels, right up there.\nRaj: Hey, guys. Mind if Emily joins us for lunch?\nLeonard: Yeah, sure.\nHoward: Yeah, no problem.\nSheldon: Of course not.\nEmily: So I hear you guys have been playing a little game.\nHoward: Well, um, we were just kidding around.\nEmily: Well, you may think it\u2019s funny that Raj is sweet and sensitive, but I think it\u2019s sexy. Ugh, why is there dog hair in your mouth?\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "3_4": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: This movie baffles me every time we watch it.\nLeonard: What do you mean?\nSheldon: Well, the instructions are very clear, don\u2019t feed the gremlins after midnight, don\u2019t get the gremlins wet. How hard is that?\nPenny (arriving): Hi, guys. Hi, honey.\nLeonard: Hey.\nHoward: Ooh, we\u2019re honey now, are we?\nSheldon: Yes. Since their relationship became carnal, Penny has upgraded his designated term of endearment, thus distinguishing him from those she calls sweetie, usually in an attempt to soften a thinly-veiled insult.\nPenny: You\u2019re boring people sweetie.\nSheldon: Although, sometimes, she omits the veil entirely.\nPenny: So, what are you guys doing?\nHoward: Celebrating Columbus Day.\nLeonard: We\u2019re watching Goonies, Gremlins and Young Sherlock Holmes. They were all written by Chris Columbus.\nPenny: Okay. What do you watch on Thanksgiving?\nSheldon: The parade.\nPenny: Oh, you know, that reminds me, I usually go back to Nebraska for thanksgiving, but this year they\u2019re calling it off on account of my brother\u2019s trial.\nLeonard: What\u2019s he on trial for?\nPenny: Oh, just a big misunderstanding. You know, you\u2019d actually like my brother, he\u2019s kind of a chemist. Anyway, I was thinking I\u2019d have thanksgiving here, and you are all invited.\nLeonard: Oh. I\u2019ll be there.\nSheldon: Will you be serving cranberry jelly or cranberry sauce?\nPenny: I guess I could serve both.\nSheldon: You guess? You don\u2019t seem to have much of a handle on this.\nHoward: Yeah, I really wish I could, Penny, but every year my mother has all the relatives over and cooks up her famous tur-briska-fil.\nPenny: Tur-briska-fil?\nHoward: Turkey stuffed with a brisket stuffed with gefilte fish. It\u2019s not as good as it sounds.\nPenny: Raj, what about you?\nHoward: Oh, he usually comes to my house. Right, pal? (Raj bursts into tears and runs away) All right, this year, you don\u2019t have to eat the tur-briska-fil. I don\u2019t even chew it. I swallow it like pills.\nCredits sequence. \n \nScene: A few moments later.\nLeonard: So, what\u2019s going on with Raj?\nHoward: Well, the good news is, he has no problem with my mother\u2019s tur-brka-fil.\nPenny: Hard to believe, but go on.\nHoward: The bad news is, he says he\u2019s getting deported.\nLeonard: What do you mean, he\u2019s getting deported?\nSheldon: I believe it means that the U.S. Government is going to expel him from the country. He could then either return to his native India, emigrate to another country that\u2019s willing to accept him, or wander the high seas as a stateless pirate. Personally, I\u2019d choose pirate.\nHoward: Penny, would you mind stepping outside so we can speak to him?\nPenny: Ugh, fine. But the man really needs to work on his girl issues.\nSheldon: Another reason to consider a life of piracy. Even today, I understand that\u2019s an all-male profession.\nHoward: Okay, she\u2019s gone.\nRaj: Sorry. I lost my cool.\nLeonard: So, what\u2019s going on?\nRaj: Okay, here\u2019s the deal, six months ago, my research testing the predicted composition of trans-Neptunian objects ran into a dead end.\nHoward: So?\nRaj: So, my visa\u2019s only good as long as I\u2019m employed at the university, and when they find out I\u2019ve got squat, they\u2019re going to cut me off. By the way, when I say squat, I mean diddly-squat. I wish I had squat.\nLeonard: So, wait, what have you been doing for the past six months?\nRaj: You know, checking e-mail, updating my facebook status, messing up wikipedia entries. Hey, did you know Netflix lets you stream movies on your computer now?\nSheldon: And you\u2019ve continued to take the university\u2019s money under false pretences? Highly unethical for an astrophysicist. Although practically mandatory for a pirate.\nRaj: I don\u2019t want to go back to India. It\u2019s hot and loud, and there\u2019s so many people. You have no idea, they\u2019re everywhere.\nHoward: Okay, guys, think, how do we keep Raj in the country?\nPenny (from outside): Why doesn\u2019t he just get another job?\nHoward (after Raj whispers to him): What are you asking me for? I don\u2019t know if you can talk now or not.\nScene: The university cafeteria.\nRaj: Oh, beef, I\u2019m going to miss you so much. Do you know, at the Mumbai McDonald\u2019s, you can\u2019t get a Big Mac? All you can get is a Chicken Maharaja Mac. And the special sauce, curry, which, in India,\nbelieve you me, is really not that special.\nLeonard: Don\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll find another job.\nRaj: Yeah let me start practicing for it. Do you want fries with that Maharaja Mac?\u201d\nSheldon: Hi, Leonard. Hello, Raj.\nRaj: Hello Sheldon.\nSheldon: Forgive me, as you know, I\u2019m no adept at reading facial cues, but I\u2019m going to take a stab here, you\u2019re either sad or nauseated.\nRaj: I\u2019m sad.\nSheldon: I was going to say sad. I don\u2019t know why I hedged.\nRaj: What are you eating?\nSheldon: Elbow macaroni with ground hamburger and tomato sauce.\nRaj: Oh, beefaroni. I think I\u2019ll miss you most of all.\nLeonard: I\u2019ve always been a little confused about this. Why don\u2019t Hindus eat beef?\nRaj: We believe cows are gods.\nSheldon: Not technically. In Hinduism, cattle are thought to be like God.\nRaj: Do not tell me about my own culture, Sheldon! In the mood I\u2019m in, I\u2019ll take you out, I swear to cow!\nSheldon: I\u2019m sorry.\nRaj: Me, too. I\u2019m just, I\u2019m a little on edge.\nSheldon: Understandable. Your entire life seems to be crumbling around you, and your future appears bleak at best.\nRaj: Thank you.\nSheldon: And you\u2019re wrong about Hinduism and cows.\nHoward (arriving): Hey, Raj, guess what. Professor Laughlin is looking for someone to join the stellar evolution research team.\nRaj: You, you\u2019re kidding. That\u2019s fantastic!\nHoward: Come on, what are you waiting for? Call him and set up an interview.\nRaj: I\u2019m on it.\nSheldon: That\u2019s happy, right?\nLeonard: Yeah.\nSheldon: Nailed it.\nScene: Professor Laughlin\u2019s office.\nProf Laughlin: Dr. Koothrappali, come on in. I was surprised to hear you were interested In joining our little team. Giving up on those trans-Neptunian objects, are we?\nRaj: No, no, it\u2019s a very promising area. In a perfect world I\u2019d spend several more years on it. But I just couldn\u2019t pass up the opportunity to work with you on your tremendously exciting and not yet conclusively disproved hypothesis.\nProf Laughlin: Splendid. Uh, please sit down. Can I offer you a sherry?\nRaj: It\u2019s a little early, isn\u2019t it?\nProf Laughlin: Not on Proxima Centauri.\nRaj: That\u2019s very good. Jolly amusing, but if you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019ll hold off until sunset on titan.\nProf Laughlin: Oh, well done. I have a feeling you\u2019re going to fit in just fine, Dr. Koothrappali.\nRaj: Thank you, sir. (There is a knock on the door. A young woman enters)\nWoman: I\u2019m sorry. Am I late?\nProf Laughlin: No, no, no. Right on time. Dr. Koothrappali, may I present Dr. Millstone from MIT. She\u2019ll be heading up our data analysis team.\nDr Millstone: It\u2019s nice to meet you, Dr. Koothrappali. I read your paper on Kuiper belt object size distribution. I really enjoyed it. How did you correct for the selection bias? (During this, Raj surreptitiously wanders over to where Prof Laughlin\u2019s drinks are, pours himself a large sherry and knocks it back in one.)\nRaj: Well, I ran a simulation that allowed me to correct for the observational efficiency.\nDr Millstone: That\u2019s just fascinating.\nRaj: Thank you. Would you like to hear more about it in my hot tub? So, when do I start?\nScene: The apartment.\nHoward: What do you mean you didn\u2019t get the job? How could you not get it?\nRaj: You know, he\u2019s British, I\u2019m Indian, ever since Gandhi they haven\u2019t liked us very much.\nLeonard: Wait, are you saying that he discriminated against you? Because we should file a complaint.\nRaj: That\u2019s okay. A complaint has been filed. So, that\u2019s it. That was my last hope. I\u2019m going to be deported, sent home in disgrace, exposed to the sardonic barbs of my cousin Sanjay. Or, as you may know him, Dave from AT&T customer service.\nHoward: I\u2019m really going to miss you.\nRaj: Will you come visit me in India?\nHoward: Gee, that\u2019s, like, a 17-hour flight. How about I meet you halfway?\nRaj: Halfway is 600 miles off the coast of Japan.\nHoward: Tell you what, we\u2019ll skype.\nSheldon (arriving): Gentlemen.\nLeonard: Hey.\nSheldon: Raj, did you get the job with Professor Laughlin?\nRaj: No.\nSheldon: I assumed as much. But never fear. Like the subordinate male protagonist in countless action movies who disappears half way through the second reel, I have returned to save the day. Odd, usually, he\u2019s met by cheers. Anyway, I was thinking about exploring the string theory implications of gamma rays from dark matter annihilations, and it occurred to me that I could benefit\u2026\nLeonard: Excuse me, Sheldon, how many reels before the subordinate male protagonist gets to his point?\nSheldon: I\u2019m sorry, if you didn\u2019t cheer at my entrance, it\u2019s too late to buy into the premise. Anyway, I got some extra money from the head of the department, and raj can come work for me.\nRaj: You want me to work with you?\nSheldon: For me. You\u2019re going to have to listen more carefully when you\u2019re on the job.\nRaj: Okay, uh, please don\u2019t take this the wrong way, but I\u2019d rather swim buck-naked across the Ganges with a paper cut on my nipple and die a slow, agonizing death from a viral infection than work with you.\nSheldon: For me.\nScene: Sheldon\u2019s office.\nRaj (knocking and entering): Sheldon, are you busy?\nSheldon: Of course I\u2019m busy.\nRaj: Shall I wait?\nSheldon: Yes, please. (After about 30 seconds) How may I help you?\nRaj: I\u2019ve reconsidered your offer to let me work with you.\nSheldon: For me.\nRaj: Yes, for you. I do, however, have a few conditions. First, at all times, I am to be treated as a colleague and an equal. Second, my contributions shall be noted in all published material. And third, you are never allowed to lecture me on Hinduism or my Indian culture.\nSheldon: I\u2019m impressed, Raj. Those are very cogent and reasonable conditions.\nRaj: Thank you.\nSheldon: I reject them all.\nRaj: Then you leave me no choice. I accept the job.\nSheldon: I\u2019m sorry, I believe you\u2019ve misunderstood. I\u2019m not giving you the job. I\u2019m simply affording you the opportunity to apply for it. Have a seat, we\u2019ll get started with the interview.\nRaj: Wha\u2026 You\u2019re kidding!\nSheldon: Please.\nRaj: All right.\nSheldon: So, that\u2019s what you wear to an interview?\nRaj: Come on, dude, we\u2019ve been friends for years.\nSheldon: Oh, pulling strings, are we?\nRaj: Sheldon, for God\u2019s sakes, don\u2019t make me beg.\nSheldon: Bazinga! You\u2019ve fallen victim to another one of my classic practical jokes. I\u2019m your boss now. You may want to laugh at that.\nScene: The apartment.\nPenny: Ah, it\u2019s nice having the place to ourselves, isn\u2019t it?\nLeonard: Uh-huh. Now that Raj is working for Sheldon, I don\u2019t have to chauffeur him around anymore. Plus, yeah, with them working late so much, we get some privacy.\nPenny: Mm-hmm. Hey, want to get a little crazy?\nLeonard: What are you thinking?\nPenny: Let\u2019s slide over to Sheldon\u2019s spot a make out.\nLeonard: You are a dirty girl.\nPenny (as the making out is interrupted by a knock on the door): Oh, God, how did he know?\nHoward: Hello.\nLeonard: Hi, Howard.\nHoward: Am I interrupting?\nLeonard: Little bit, yeah.\nHoward: Guess I should have called.\nPenny: Yeah, maybe.\nHoward: Tonight\u2019s the night I usually go line dancing with Raj at the palomino.\nLeonard: Uh-huh.\nHoward: But he\u2019s working with Sheldon.\nPenny: Yes, we know.\nHoward: Want me to leave?\nLeonard: You know, whatever.\nHoward: Okay, I guess I can hang for a little while. So what are we watching? Sex and the city.\nYikes.\nPenny: Hey, I happen to love this movie.\nHoward: Fine, let\u2019s watch it. Maybe all our periods will synchronize.\nScene: Sheldon\u2019s office.\nSheldon: All right, we\u2019re going to be designing an experiment to look for the annihilation spectrum resulting from dark matter collisions in space.\nRaj: Ooh, dark matter. We better bring a flashlight. I was making a joke.\nSheldon: I\u2019m the boss. I make the jokes.\nRaj: Sorry, go ahead and make your joke.\nSheldon: This is not the time for joking. We\u2019re doing serious research, which requires complete and utter focus.\nRaj: All right, let\u2019s buckle down and work.\n(To the tune of Eye of the Tiger by Survivor, there is a montage of images, in all of which Sheldon and Raj are staring at the same equation on a whiteboard.) \nRaj: Sheldon.\nSheldon: What?\nRaj: I need an aspirin.\nSheldon: Top desk drawer.\nRaj: Thank you.\nSheldon: Alright?\nRaj: Yes.\nSheldon: Good.\n(Montage of scenes resumes) \n \nScene: Penny and Leonard exiting Leonard\u2019s bedroom. \nLeonard: That was fun. Thank you.\nPenny: Leonard, honey, you don\u2019t have to say thank you every time we have sex.\nLeonard: Oh. Okay. Tomorrow you\u2019re going to get a card in the mail. Just throw it away.\nHoward: Top o\u2019 the mornin\u2019o ya!\nLeonard: What are you doing here?\nHoward: Well, usually, on Sundays, I go with Raj to scam on hippie chicks at the farmers market, but he\u2019s still working with Sheldon, so I thought I\u2019d come over here and make you guys scrambled eggs and salami. It\u2019s the perfect meal for apres l\u2019amour.\nPenny: Oh, kill me.\nHoward: By the way, I couldn\u2019t help overhearing your big finish. Bravo, Leonard.\nPenny: See, if you had killed me when I said kill me, I wouldn\u2019t have had to hear that.\nHoward: What do you guys think? Want to take in a matinee, maybe go rollerblading, catch a step class?\nPenny: Do something.\nLeonard: Yeah, okay. Um, Howard, we need to talk.\nHoward: Sure. \u2018sup, homes?\nLeonard: Uh, please understand that it\u2019s not that we don\u2019t want you around, but Penny and I occasionally need some alone time.\nHoward: Oh. I get it, I\u2019m the third wheel. Sorry, I should have seen that. I\u2019ll get out of your way. Uh, you\u2019re gonna want to eat those eggs while they\u2019re still hot.\nLeonard: Thank you. There\u2019s lox and cream cheese in the fridge, the bagels are in the oven, I was warming them up.\nPenny: That\u2019s great.\nHoward: Ill just hang out with my mom. That\u2019s always fun.\nLeonard: Good.\nPenny: Are we terrible people?\nLeonard: I don\u2019t know. What do you want me to do?\nPenny: Get him, bring him back.\nLeonard: Are you sure?\nPenny: Yeah.\nLeonard: Okay. Howard come back.\nHoward: Oh, you guys had me scared for a minute.\nScene: Sheldon\u2019s office. Sheldon is writing on the whiteboard.\n \nRaj: No, no, no, no! That rate is much too low for what we\u2019d expect from this collision. Do you understand that we\u2019re talking about dark matter colliding in outer space?\nSheldon: Of course I understand. And who are you to tell me about outer space?\nRaj: I\u2019m the astrophysicist. Astro means space.\nSheldon: Astro means star.\nRaj: Okay, well, let me just tell you, if we were having this argument in my native language, I\u2019d be kicking your butt.\nSheldon: English is your native language.\nRaj: Okay, you got me there, but you\u2019re wrong about this!\nSheldon: There is a fine line between wrong and visionary. Unfortunately you have to be a visionary to see it.\nRaj: My god, you think that every thought that comes out of your head is pure gold. Well, let me tell you something. Some of those thoughts are pure caca.\nSheldon: Caca?\nRaj: It means doo-doo.\nSheldon: All right! First of all, Dr. Koothrappali, when I first proposed that you work with me\u2026\nRaj: Aha! So I am working with you.\nSheldon: In this context, with me means for me.\nRaj: Ah, well, in this context\u2026 (blows raspberry)\nSheldon: Oh! If I\u2019m wrong, prove it.\nRaj: Okay. Here\u2019s where we derive the mass of the dark matter particle.\nSheldon: No, no, no, you\u2019ve misstated the atomic weight of the target.\nRaj: Let me finish.\nSheldon: You\u2019re defacing my work.\nRaj: I\u2019m not defacing it, I\u2019m fixing it.\nSheldon: Give me the eraser.\nRaj: No.\nSheldon: I said give it to me.\nRaj: Come and get it.\nSheldon: Fine. (Uses hand as an eraser. Then realises his hand is dirty) Oh, lord. Dr. Koothrappali, as your superior, I forbid you from writing on my board!\nRaj: You are not my superior.\nSheldon: I am in every way.\nRaj: Oh, yeah? Can you do this? (Performs\u00a0 complex finger trick*) Nice working with you. I\u2019m sorry, for you. (Exits. Sheldon stares a moment, then tries to perform the trick. Fails.)\nScene: Outside Raj\u2019s flat.\n \nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Raj. (Knock, knock, knock) Raj. (Knock, knock, knock) Raj.\nRaj: I\u2019m busy.\nSheldon: Doing what? (Performs finger trick again) All right, you\u2019ve made your point.\nRaj: What do you want, Sheldon?\nSheldon: I looked over the board and it turns out you were right.\nRaj: So you were wrong.\nSheldon: I didn\u2019t say that.\nRaj: That\u2019s the only logical inference.\nSheldon: Nevertheless, I didn\u2019t say it. Anyway, I would like you to come back and work for me.\nRaj: For you or with you?\nSheldon: In this context for me could mean with me.\nRaj: All right, but I have some conditions.\nSheldon: I reject them all.\nRaj: I\u2019ll take the job. See you Monday.\nSheldon: Wait, you have to drive me home.\nRaj: How did you get here?\nSheldon: I walked.\nRaj: So walk home.\nSheldon: I can\u2019t. There\u2019s a big dog outside. On the way home, we can start thinking about methods of optimizing the detector for 500 GEV particles.\nRaj: All right. (As they walk down the corridor, Eye of the Tiger starts playing again.)\n(* to perform trick, place both hands together as if praying, then fold two middle fingers over so that they pass to the right of one another, finally rotate right hand anti-clockwise and waggle both middle fingers)\n\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "9_10": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: Sheldon\u2019s bedroom.\nSheldon: Sheldon Cooper\u2019s descent into madness, day two. It\u2019s 2:25 a.m., and I feel the urge to urinate. My normal urination time is 7:10 a.m., but here I am, in the middle of the night, struggling to keep my mind sharp and my pajamas dry. It\u2019s only a matter of time before my tenuous grasp on reality fades. I suppose I should pee while I still know what a toilet is.\nScene: The apartment. 2 days earlier.\nLeonard: Since when do you hum songs?\nSheldon: What are you talking about?\nLeonard: You were just humming.\nSheldon: Are you sure? Sometimes when my brain really gets moving, it makes noise.\nLeonard: How does your brain feel about calculating the surface tension of the domain walls?\nSheldon: Let\u2019s see. Hey, I was humming. One point for Hufflepuff. What song is that?\nLeonard: Well, hum it again. Is that the SpongeBob song?\nSheldon (singing): Who lives in a pineapple. Nope.\nLeonard: Whatever. Can we just get back to this?\nSheldon: I feel like I know what song that is, but I can\u2019t put my finger on it. (Singing) My country, \u2019tis of thee. No.\nLeonard: It\u2019s just an earworm. It\u2019ll come to you.\nSheldon: Okay. (Singing) R-E-S-P-E-C-T. No.\nLeonard: Is this what we\u2019re doing the rest of the night?\nSheldon (singing): I\u2019m surprised you have to ask.\nCredits sequence. \nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon (on phone): Hello, yes, I was hoping you could help me. What song is this? La, la, la, la, la, la, la. You don\u2019t know? Well, how dare you call yourselves a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame? My goodness. Do you sing along to the greatest hits of Elvis Presley with that mouth? Well, they were no help at all.\nLeonard: Which is crazy, since rock and roll is all about good customer service.\nPenny: Yeah. So you have a song stuck in your head. It happens to everybody.\nSheldon: Well, I\u2019m not everybody. I have an eidetic memory. I should be able to remember what song this is, but I can\u2019t. Something\u2019s wrong with me.\nPenny: I told you if we were patient, he\u2019d figure it out for himself.\nSheldon: I was always afraid this day would come. This might be the first step of my descent into madness, where I gradually test the limits of public nudity.\nPenny: Public nudity?\nLeonard: Eh, that just means going barefoot.\nScene: Amy\u2019s apartment.\nDave (voice on phone): Hello?\nAmy: Hi, Dave. Uh, it\u2019s Amy.\nDave: Oh. How are you?\nAmy: I\u2019m fine. How are you?\nDave: Terrific. And pleasantly surprised to hear from you, given how I acted on our last date.\nAmy: Yeah, well, we both made mistakes, you know. I took the last breadstick, you gushed over my ex-boyfriend like he was Leonard Nimoy and you were my ex-boyfriend.\nDave: So, to what do I owe the pleasure?\nAmy: Well, I was wondering if you\u2019d like to get dinner again sometime.\nDave: Yes, please.\nAmy: Great.\nDave: Let me just check my schedule, he said, trying to seem like a man with things on his schedule.\nAmy: How \u2019bout Saturday?\nDave: Uh, hmm, let me see. Uh, Friday, farmers\u2019 market with Jay Z. Sunday, piano shopping with Elton John. Saturday works.\nScene: Howard\u2019s workshop.\nRaj: Oh. Did you know, at the United Nations, there\u2019s a Department for Outer Space Affairs?\nHoward: Really? Why?\nRaj: They exist in case we ever make contact with an alien civilization.\nHoward: Mm, boy, that\u2019s one of those jobs that\u2019s boring, boring, boring, then, oh, God, where\u2019s the memo with what we do now?\nRaj: Oh, this is cool. So, a few weeks ago I set up a fan page on Facebook for our band and\u2026\nHoward: Wait a second. How could you do that without consulting me?\nRaj: It\u2019s not a big deal. It just took, like, five minutes to set up.\nHoward: That\u2019s not the point. When we created Footprints on the Moon, we agreed that every band decision would be mutual. Now you\u2019re just trying to take over the whole thing. You know, maybe I should go solo.\nRaj: But someone joined our page. We have an actual fan.\nHoward: All right. This thing\u2019s bigger than you and me, band\u2019s back together.\nRaj: So, listen to what he wrote. Uh, I saw you play at the comic book store. You guys rock. And then there\u2019s an animated smiley face raising the roof like this.\nHoward: We did raise the roof that night.\nRaj: Yeah, we totally did.\nHoward: Why do rock stars do drugs when this feels so great?\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon (singing): Why can\u2019t I recall this song? This is taking far too long. The urge to bang my head against the wall again and again and again and again and again is strong.\nLeonard: Put on some headphones.\nSheldon (singing): No they make my earlobes sweat.\nPenny: Hey, sweetie, why don\u2019t you take a break and do something else for a while?\nSheldon: There was a project I\u2019ve been thinking about starting.\nPenny: Okay, great. What is it?\nSheldon: I\u2019ll show you. (Into phone camera) Dear Crazy Future Sheldon, you were driven mad by an earworm. Your mind, once your most trusted asset, is now a sack of parrots and monkeys. So, I\u2019m going to tell you everything you need to know. Uh, first, music is dangerous. The movie Footloose tried to warn us, but we wouldn\u2019t listen. Oh, wait. (Singing) Everyody cut footloose. Nope.\nPenny: I\u2019ll pay a thousand dollars to watch you cut footloose.\nSheldon: This is Penny. She is your friend. If she offers you food, it\u2019s safe to take it. You probably paid for it, anyway.\nScene: Amy\u2019s apartment.\nBernadette: So, you\u2019re really going out with Dave again?\nAmy: Why not? He\u2019s actually a very nice guy.\nBernadette: But he spent an entire date talking about how much he loves Sheldon.\nAmy: That\u2019s nothing Sheldon hasn\u2019t done before. Dave\u2019s just a big fan of his work. Besides, he said he wouldn\u2019t bring it up again.\nBernadette: Okay. So where\u2019s he taking you?\nAmy: Oh, he\u2019s coming here. I\u2019m actually making dinner.\nBernadette: Oh. That\u2019s a big step.\nAmy: It is?\nBernadette: Yeah. You\u2019re inviting him into your home. It\u2019s intimate. It\u2019s where your underpants live.\nAmy: You know what? Good. I tried to get back together with Sheldon, he shot me down. Dave likes me. Maybe intimate is what I need.\nBernadette: You sure? You\u2019ve never really been with a man. Do you really want to start with one that\u2019s six-foot-seven?\nAmy: Why not?\nBernadette: \u2018Cause it\u2019s like taking your driver\u2019s test in a bus.\nScene: Howard\u2019s workshop.\nRaj: Maybe we should post a comment back to our fan and thank him.\nHoward: What should we write?\nRaj: How about, uh, oh, how about, we might be Footprints on the Moon, but your kind words sent us over the moon.\nHoward: Someday you\u2019re gonna make an amazing grandma.\nRaj: Well what do you want to write?\nHoward: Something badass, you know, like, thanks for diggin\u2019 our vibe. We\u2019ll keep rockin\u2019 if you keep rollin\u2019.\nRaj: Dude, if I was wearing a bra, I\u2019d throw it at your head right now.\nHoward: I\u2019ll keep rockin\u2019. You don\u2019t do that.\nRaj: Okay. I posted it.\nHoward: So, who is this guy?\nRaj: Let\u2019s see. Uh, his name is Trent Monaco.\nHoward: Cool name.\nRaj: Yeah. He\u2019s 24. He\u2019s a deejay. He brews his own beer. He\u2019s got awesome tattoos. Dude, he\u2019s got a hot girlfriend, too.\nHoward: Damn. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s our biggest fan or I\u2019m his. Hey, Trent just liked our comment.\nRaj: He is so cool. Hey, no hard feelings, but I\u2019m throwing my hypothetical bra at him.\nScene: Leonard\u2019s bedroom. Sheldon is playing his tune on a keyboard in the background.\nPenny: Oh, my God, he won\u2019t stop.\nLeonard: How does he keep coming up with new ways to be annoying?\nPenny: Nobody knows. That\u2019s why he\u2019s number one. Can you please go talk to him?\nLeonard: Come on. I take care of him all day long. You do it for once.\nPenny: Once? Who got the gum out of his hair?\nLeonard: What do you want, a medal? It was your gum.\nPenny: Fine.\nLeonard: I love you.\nPenny: Who cares?\nSheldon (off): What are you doing in my room? Stop it. That\u2019s mine. Why are you so strong?\nPenny: Problem solved.\nLeonard: Oh, yeah, he got a tuba.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Dear Crazy Future Sheldon, this is a thermostat. It controls the temperature of the apartment. The ideal setting is 72 degrees. If you find this too cold, then put on a jacket. A straitjacket, \u2019cause 72\u2019s the best and you\u2019re crazy. Now, this is your spot. You\u2019re very protective of it. When anyone else tries to sit here, you berate them relentlessly. It sounds mean, but somehow you make it adorable. People are also delighted by your love of pranks. For example, Leonard has no idea what I did to his coffee. It wasn\u2019t replace it with Folger\u2019s crystals, I\u2019ll tell you that much.\nLeonard: Hey, can we please get back to work?\nSheldon: This is Leonard. He\u2019s your best friend in the world.\nLeonard: All right, just stop. This is ridiculous.\nSheldon: Sometimes he gets cranky, but you can trust him with your life. And he does more things for you than I can even begin to list.\nLeonard: Thank you.\nSheldon: Oh, no, he\u2019s drinking it.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s house.\nHoward: Look at this. Trent is rebuilding a vintage motorcycle.\nRaj: That is so cool. Old broken things are so much better than new things that work.\nBernadette: Who\u2019s Trent?\nHoward: Oh, he\u2019s our fan.\nBernadette: Fan of what?\nHoward: Uh, did you forget? We\u2019re in a band.\nBernadette: You mean because you played one time in the comic book store?\nHoward: And at the children\u2019s hospital until they asked us to leave.\nRaj: Hey, dude, Trent just checked in at the coffee shop on Fair Oaks.\nHoward: Really? You want to go down there and meet him?\nBernadette: Are you stalking him? That\u2019s creepy.\nRaj: It\u2019s not creepy. I built a Footprints on the Moon fan page, Trent joined it.\nHoward: After that, all I did was check out his profile, go back in the archive of his feed until I found his Twitter handle.\nRaj: From there, it was easy to find him on Instagram, Snapchat and pretty much track his every movement.\nHoward: So if you think that\u2019s creepy, you married the wrong guy.\nBernadette: Maybe I should marry Trent.\nRaj: Yeah, like she could get Trent.\nScene: Amy\u2019s apartment.\nDave: This is delicious.\nAmy: Thank you.\nDave: Been a long time since I had a home-cooked meal.\nAmy: When you were married, did your wife cook?\nDave: Not at first, no. But when she began cheating on me with a French chef, she became quite the wiz in the kitchen.\nAmy: So, a little silver lining.\nDave: I suppose. Yeah. Nothing takes the sting out of a shattered life like a properly-seasoned bowl of onion soup. How long have you, uh, lived here?\nAmy: Uh, about five years. I\u2019m actually thinking of moving to a better place now that I don\u2019t need to be so close to, well, you know.\nDave: I do. The brilliant physicist that I now know lives in the area, not that I care.\nAmy: Yeah. Anyway, he doesn\u2019t drive, so, I pretty much had to take him everywhere.\nDave: Had to or got to? Sorry.\nAmy: My fault. I brought him up.\nDave: Yeah. Well, let\u2019s change the subject. No more mentions of you-know-who. That\u2019s a cool train. Where did you get that?\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Bah, bam, bum-bum, bah, bum, bum. This song is never going to stop. Have you ever dealt with something so relentlessly irritating?\nLeonard: That\u2019s a trick question, right?\nSheldon: Well, I shouldn\u2019t be surprised. There\u2019s a rich history of brilliant minds descending into madness.\nPenny: Come on, Sheldon. There are plenty of smart people who don\u2019t have mental problems.\nLeonard: Yup, she\u2019s right. For every Newton who had a psychological issue, there\u2019s an Edison who was just a jerk. That could totally be you.\nSheldon: Empedocles thought he was a god and jumped into a volcano. And Pythagoras had an irrational fear of beans. Tesla fell madly in love with a pigeon who he claimed loved him back.\nPenny: Maybe he just had bread in his pocket.\nSheldon: The list extends outside of science. Painters like Van Gogh and Pollock, chess champion Bobby Fischer, Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys. (Clip of Darling by the Beach Boys) I remember the song. It\u2019s called Darlin\u2019 by the Beach Boys. Oh, thank goodness. I\u2019m not crazy. I don\u2019t have to take a pigeon as my bride.\nLeonard: There goes our shot at him living on the roof.\nScene: A coffee shop.\nRaj: So, all right, there he is. So, should we introduce ourselves?\nHoward: No. Let him spot us.\nRaj: I wonder if he\u2019s listening to our music right now.\nHoward: Could you imagine? What a cool way for us to meet. He\u2019s playing our song and looks up, and there we are, his favorite two-piece acoustic sci-fi novelty rock band.\nRaj: And he\u2019s, all, like, aren\u2019t you the guys from Footprints on the Moo-oo-ooh what is he doing?!\nHoward: I can\u2019t watch.\nRaj: It\u2019s okay. Oh, it\u2019s okay. He\u2019s done.\nHoward: Why is he looking at it?\nRaj: Eh, no, he\u2019s not going to eat it, is he?\nHoward: Come on, Trent, you\u2019re better than th-ah.\nRaj: Ooh!\nHoward: Let\u2019s just go.\nTrent: Hey, aren\u2019t you the guys?\nHoward: Nope.\nRaj: No, never heard of \u2019em!\nScene: The apartment. Sheldon is listening to Darlin\u2019\nSheldon: I wonder why it was this particular song that was stuck in my head.\nLeonard: I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s pretty catchy.\nPenny: Do you even like the Beach Boys?\nSheldon: They have beach right in the name. What do you think?\nLeonard: Well, now that you can focus again, what do you say we get back to surface tension of domain walls?\nSheldon: Of course. I\u2019m already seeing a more efficient way of taming the ultravi\u2026 I know why the song was in my head.\nPenny: Why?\nSheldon: It\u2019s about Amy.\nPenny: Okay, look, I know Amy\u2019s like an old lady, but she\u2019s not old enough to have a song from the sixties written about her.\nSheldon: It\u2019s about how she made my life better. Consider the lyrics. I was living like half a man. Then I couldn\u2019t love, but now I can. More soul than I ever had. I love the way you soften my life.\u201d\nPenny: She did soften your life, didn\u2019t she?\nSheldon: Yes. She\u2019s like the dryer sheets of my heart. I have to go.\nLeonard: Aw. Am I like the dryer sheets of your heart?\nPenny: Better. You\u2019re the lint trap of my love.\nLeonard: Aw.\nScene: Amy\u2019s apartment.\nAmy: That\u2019s an interesting tie clip.\nDave: Oh, thanks. It\u2019s, uh, Avogadro\u2019s constant. It\u2019s useful for calculating the number of atoms in a substance, or causing regret in anyone who asks about it.\nAmy: No, I, I think it\u2019s neat. Oh.\nDave: Sorry. Sorry. No one\u2019s ever liked the tie clip before, so I just lost all control.\nAmy: No, it, it\u2019s okay, and we are on a date. I\u2019m, I\u2019m just a little nervous.\nDave: Well, no need to be nervous with me. I\u2019m just a harmless giant from a foreign land.\nAmy: You know, I\u2019m just being silly. I, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m waiting for.\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Amy? (Knock, knock, knock) Amy? (Knock, knock, knock) Amy?\nAmy: That\u2019s Sheldon.\nDave: You\u2019re kidding. How\u2019s my hair?\nAmy: Sheldon, this, this isn\u2019t a good time.\nSheldon: I don\u2019t care. Amy, there was a song I couldn\u2019t get out of my head. Eventually, I realized the song was about you, and like that earworm, I can\u2019t get you out of my heart. So, what I\u2019m trying to say is, you\u2019re my heartworm. The metaphorical kind, not, not the poodle-killing kind.\nAmy: What?\nDave: If I may, I believe what he\u2019s saying, in a charming and delightful way, is that he loves you and wants you back. Dave Gibbs, huge fan of your work. Don\u2019t mind me.\nSheldon: I\u2019m, I\u2019m sorry; I didn\u2019t realize you were on a date.\nAmy: No, it, it, it\u2019s okay. Keep going?\nSheldon: Amy, if you want to be my girlfriend again, I really want to be your boyfriend.\nAmy: I really want that, too.\nSheldon: Good. Because I love you.\nAmy: I love you, too.\nDave: Kiss her, you brilliant fool.\nSheldon: Well, I\u2019ll let you get back to your date.\nAmy: Get back here.\nDave: Okay, then. I\u2019ll, uh, see myself out. Amy, thank you for dinner. Dr. Cooper, pleasure to meet you, sir. Uh, if perhaps sometime you have a spare moment, I\u2019d, uh, love to discuss physics, or shoot the breeze, as you Yanks say. Ah. What a lovely evening.\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "6_8": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The cafeteria. Sheldon is drawing on a napkin.\nRaj: What are you drawing over there?\nSheldon: It\u2019s a hypothetical containment field for a Frisbee-sized wormhole that could serve as a portal to a parallel universe.\nHoward: Oh, you silly doodlebug.\nLeonard: You know, a lot of scientists believe that making contact with other life-forms would probably not end well for us.\nSheldon: It\u2019s a Frisbee-sized wormhole, Leonard. You can block it with a Frisbee. Calm down. (Hands Howard the napkin)\nHoward: Do you expect me to build this?\nSheldon: I expect you to wipe the pudding off your chin. Gentlemen.\nHoward: Have you guys ever noticed that Sheldon always disappears every day at two forty-five?\nLeonard: Really?\nRaj: He probably just goes to the bathroom.\nLeonard: Actually, no, he goes to the bathroom at eight a.m. with optional follow-ups at one forty-five and seven ten high-fibre Fridays.\nRaj: It\u2019s sad that you know that.\nLeonard: Oh, that\u2019s just the tip of the sadness iceberg.\nHoward: I\u2019m looking at his public calendar. Two forty-five to three-oh-five, nothing. Yesterday, two forty-five to three-oh-five, nothing, last week, nothing, last month, nothing. He never has anything booked during that time.\nRaj: Twenty minutes a day, completely unaccounted for.\nHoward: We should figure out where he goes.\nRaj: Ooh, this is exciting. Like one of my classic murder mystery dinner parties.\nLeonard: Right, the case of who murdered three Saturday nights of my life?\nHoward: Colonel Koothrapali in the kitchen with the olive spread.\nRaj: It was tapenade and you guys suck.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment. Penny is texting.\nPenny: So, how was work today?\nLeonard: Well, I spent most of the afternoon growing isotopically pure crystals for neutrino detection.\nPenny: That sounds like fun.\nLeonard: Yeah, it was.\nPenny: Oh, good, I guessed right.\nLeonard: Who you talking to?\nPenny: Oh, just this guy I met at school.\nLeonard: Oh, great. We\u2019re still dating, right?\nPenny: Relax. He\u2019s just a friend. We\u2019re doing an oral report together. He\u2019s really nice.\nLeonard: I\u2019m sorry, what was that? I had a little stroke after oral.\nPenny: Would you stop? Look, he just moved here from London, okay? He doesn\u2019t really know anybody.\nLeonard: Oh, good, an English accent, the sexiest accent you can have.\nPenny: No. That\u2019s not true. There\u2019s French, there\u2019s Italian. No, you\u2019re right, it\u2019s the best.\nLeonard: Did you tell him you have a boyfriend?\nPenny: It didn\u2019t come up.\nLeonard: Well, maybe you should tell him.\nPenny: What am I supposed to say?\nLeonard: Say, can\u2019t talk right now, hanging with my boyfriend. England sucks, you suck, USA number one.\nPenny: Fine. Hanging with my boyfriend. Talk to you later. Happy?\nLeonard: Yes. Thank you.\nPenny: Mm-hmm. Hmm.\nLeonard: What did he say?\nPenny: Nothing.\nLeonard: What?\nPenny: Did your boyfriend make you type that?\nLeonard: I hate this guy.\nPenny: Don\u2019t be like that.\nLeonard: Come on, trust me, he\u2019s hitting on you.\nPenny: No, he\u2019s not. We\u2019re just friends. Look, is this gonna be a problem? Because he\u2019s supposed to come over tomorrow to work.\nLeonard: Really? Here?\nPenny: If it makes you uncomfortable, I\u2019ll switch partners, even though the thing\u2019s due next week and everyone already has a partner and I\u2019ll probably end up failing the class.\nLeonard: That\u2019d be great. Thank you.\nScene: The corridor outside Sheldon\u2019s office.\nHoward: Two forty-four, Right on schedule. Hey, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Oh, hello.\nHoward: Raj and I are heading over to the genetics lab to pet the glow-in-the-dark bunny. Want to come with us?\nSheldon: No, thank you.\nRaj: Are you sure? They turn off the lights, and it\u2019s like a cute little laser show that poops all over the place.\nSheldon: I\u2019m quite sure. Good day.\nHoward: Well, where are you going?\nSheldon: Where are you going?\nRaj: We just told you.\nSheldon: I just told you.\nHoward: No, you didn\u2019t.\nSheldon: Well, it\u2019s your word against mine; see you in court.\nHoward: Should we follow him?\nRaj: I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m torn. I want to know where he\u2019s going, but now I kind of want to play with the bunny.\nAlex: Hi, guys.\nHoward: Hey, Alex, do you know where your boss just went?\nAlex: No.\nHoward: Don\u2019t you know his schedule?\nAlex: All I know is corduroy makes too much noise and I have to go find quieter pants.\nHoward: Come on.\nRaj: Boy, what I wouldn\u2019t give to get her out of those pants and into something a little more stylish.\nScene: A corridor in the basement. Sheldon takes out a key, unlocks a door and enters.\nHoward: This is where he goes? What\u2019s in there?\nRaj: I think it\u2019s an old storage room.\nHoward: What could he be doing in there every day for twenty minutes?\nRaj: Well, he\u2019s not doing twenty-minute abs, because if he were, he would have way better abs. Can you hear anything?\nHoward: Not yet. What are you doing?\nRaj: I\u2019m listening.\nHoward: Can\u2019t you face the other way and listen?\nRaj: I can\u2019t do anything right for you, can I?\nHoward: What the hell is he up to?\nRaj: He is kind of a weirdo. Maybe he\u2019s got Leonard Nimoy chained up in there. Or Bill Gates. Or Stephen Hawking.\nHoward: Why would he chain up Stephen Hawking?\nRaj: Howard, please, you can\u2019t treat the man differently just because he\u2019s disabled. That\u2019s not okay.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: If you\u2019re wondering why I\u2019ve been staring through the peephole, I\u2019m trying to get a look at this guy who\u2019s coming over to Penny\u2019s.\nSheldon: To be honest, I didn\u2019t know you were here.\nLeonard: It\u2019s not a big deal. He\u2019s just in her history class. They\u2019re working on a project together. I don\u2019t even know why I care. You know what, I don\u2019t care.\nSheldon: You think you don\u2019t care?\nLeonard: This is silly. I have nothing to worry about.\nSheldon: Oh, I don\u2019t know. I mean, statistically speaking, I\u2019m sure you have something to worry about.\nLeonard: What do you mean?\nSheldon: Well, if we assume your looks are average, yeah, right off the bat, fifty percent of men on Earth are more attractive than you. That\u2019s one point five billion handsome lads standing by, waiting to rain on your parade.\nLeonard: Well, yeah, but this isn\u2019t just about looks. I\u2019m, I\u2019m way above average in a lot of other things.\nSheldon: Not height, vision, athleticism, or ability to digest dairy products.\nLeonard: I\u2019m talking about important things like emotional maturity.\nSheldon: You were just spying on your girlfriend through a peephole.\nLeonard: I liked it better when you thought I wasn\u2019t here.\nSheldon: I\u2019m not saying you don\u2019t have attractive qualities. Your choice of friends is impeccable, you\u2019re a good sleeper, and last but not least, you buy the grapes I like. You\u2019re a real catch compared to some snoring guy with a fridge full of lousy grapes.\nLeonard: None of this matters. I trust that Penny cares about me, and nothing\u2019s gonna happen with this guy.\nSheldon: Well, unless of course he\u2019s a skilled hypnotist.\nLeonard: What?\nSheldon: While unlikely, it\u2019s still a statistical possibility. She might be performing sexual acts with him and not even know it.\nLeonard: Now you\u2019re just being ridiculous.\nSheldon: Am I? The mind\u2019s a mysterious thing, Leonard. He could be having the time of his life while she thinks she\u2019s a chicken pecking for corn.\nScene: The university basement.\nRaj: Look at us, sneaking around in the middle of the night like a couple of cat burglars.\nHoward: I think we\u2019re more like ninjas.\nRaj: I don\u2019t want to be a ninja, I want to be a cat burglar.\nHoward: Fine, I\u2019ll be a ninja, you be a cat burglar.\nRaj: No, we both have to be the same thing. Okay, we\u2019re ninjas.\nHoward: Thank you.\nRaj: But next time, we\u2019ll be cat burglars.\nHoward: It\u2019s locked.\nRaj: Are you sure?\nHoward: Yes, I\u2019m sure. Now, you stand guard, I\u2019m going to\u2026\nRaj (trying door): It\u2019s locked.\nHoward: Just keep an eye out. I\u2019ll have this open in a minute.\nRaj: When did you learn how to pick locks?\nHoward: When I was starting to do magic in junior high, I thought I could be an escape artist like Harry Houdini.\nRaj: How did that work out?\nHoward: Pretty good. I managed to escape friends, popularity, and every party thrown in a twelve mile radius. There. Ready?\nRaj: Hold on, hold on.\nHoward: What?\nRaj: Sheldon is a very smart man, and he obviously wants to keep this a secret.\nHoward: Yeah, so?\nRaj: What if it\u2019s booby-trapped?\nHoward: Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m one step ahead of him.\nRaj: Great, what\u2019s your pl\u2026 (Howard pushes him inside)\nHoward: Are we good?\nRaj: Yeah. Huh. Forty-three? What the hell does that mean?\nHoward: I don\u2019t know. The solution to an equation?\nRaj: Maybe. It\u2019s a prime number. Encryption systems are built on prime numbers.\nHoward: What kind of secret does Sheldon have to encrypt?\nRaj: He\u2019s always been very cagey about what he puts in his egg salad to make it so tasty.\nHoward: It\u2019s paprika.\nRaj: Really? Well, oh, okay, one mystery solved.\nScene: The apartment.\nVoice from Outside: Okay, good night.\nPenny (off): Thanks, Cole. See you at school.\nCole (off): See you.\nLeonard: I\u2019ll be right back.\nSheldon: I thought you left a long time ago.\nLeonard (rushing to catch up with Cole): \u2018sup?\nCole: Hey.\nLeonard: You, uh, moving into the apartment on the fifth floor?\nCole: No, I was just visiting a friend.\nLeonard: Oh, cool. That cute blonde on four?\nCole: Yeah. You know her?\nLeonard: I, well, I see her around. I like to keep my distance because her boyfriend is a pretty scary dude.\nCole: Really?\nLeonard: Yeah. He\u2019s ganged up.\nCole: She told me he\u2019s a scientist.\nLeonard: That\u2019s the name of his gang. The Scientists. They are crazy.\nCole: Well, thanks for the tip.\nLeonard: No problem, brother. Stay frosty. (Cole leaves. Leonard spots Penny watching.) We\u2019re still dating, right?\nScene: The cafeteria.\nAlex: Oh, hello, Dr. Hofstadter.\nLeonard: Hey, Alex, and call me Leonard. Dr. Hofstadter is my father. And my mother. And my sister. And our cat. Although, I\u2019m pretty sure Dr. Boots Hofstadter\u2019s degree was honorary.\nAlex: May I join you, Leonard?\nLeonard: Sure.\nAlex: Thanks.\nLeonard: Hey, Alex, let me ask you something. My girlfriend knows this guy at school. He\u2019s got an English accent.\nAlex: Ooh, I love English accents.\nLeonard: Yeah, you all do. Anyway, I feel like he\u2019s hitting on her. She says he\u2019s just being nice and that I should trust her.\nAlex: It\u2019s probably harmless. You know how it is. I\u2019m sure you get hit on all the time.\nLeonard: Right. Because girls are always like, ooh, that guy owns two Star Trek uniforms and gets a lot of ear infections. I got to get me some of that.\nAlex: I don\u2019t know, I bet it happens more than you realize.\nLeonard: Trust me, it doesn\u2019t.\nAlex: You sure? You\u2019re cute, you\u2019re funny. Maybe you\u2019re getting hit on, and you don\u2019t even know it.\nLeonard: Really?\nAlex: Yep, pretty sure.\nLeonard (laughs): Okay, I got to get back to work. Thanks for listening.\nAlex: No problem.\nLeonard: Hope-hope no girls rip my clothes off on the way.\nScene: Raj\u2019s office.\nRaj: Come on, we\u2019re smart guys. We can figure this out.\nHoward: Forty-three. What is forty-three? Besides my mom\u2019s neck size.\nRaj: It\u2019s the atomic number for technetium.\nHoward: That stuff\u2019s radioactive.\nRaj: Do you think he\u2019s building a bomb?\nHoward: Ah, it took him two years to put together that Lego Death Star, I\u2019m not worried.\nRaj: Ooh, this could be something. forty-three is the number of calories in half a cup of fat-free yoghurt.\nHoward: Why would you know that?\nRaj: I\u2019m sorry. We can\u2019t all eat whatever we want and still stay thin. Wait, in the Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy, isn\u2019t forty-three the answer to the question of life, the universe,and everything?\nHoward: That\u2019s forty-two, dumb-ass.\nRaj: Hey, hey. Feelings.\nHoward: We should stop. I\u2019m exhausted.\nRaj: Yeah, me, too. We\u2019ve got more important things to do. Who cares what stupid forty-three means?\nHoward: Not me.\nRaj: Let\u2019s go home. You want to get something to eat?\nHoward: Sounds good.\nRaj: What the balls is forty-three?\nHoward: I have to know!\nScene: The stairwell.\nLeonard: Hi.\nPenny: Hey, shouldn\u2019t you be out with your gang, spray painting equations on the side of buildings?\nLeonard: Come on, I\u2019m sorry.\nPenny: I just can\u2019t believe you don\u2019t trust me.\nLeonard: I do, of course I do.\nPenny: Then why did you embarrass me in front of my friend, who, by the way, knew exactly who you were?\nLeonard: Really?\nPenny: Your picture\u2019s on my refrigerator.\nLeonard: Oh. You know, I\u2019m really starting to not like this guy.\nPenny: What is your problem? Do you use up all your thinking at work and then have none left over for when you get home?\nLeonard: I don\u2019t know. It-it-it\u2019s hard sometimes. Everywhere you go, guys hit on you, even if I\u2019m standing right there. And they\u2019re all taller than me. Why is everyone taller than me? You know what, this is all in my head. It\u2019s my problem, not yours.\nPenny: Leonard, why do you always do this? Listen to me, you\u2019re the one I\u2019m with. You know I love you, so will you please relax because you\u2019re driving me crazy.\nLeonard: You know that\u2019s the first time you ever said that you love me.\nPenny: Yeah.\nLeonard: We\u2019re just supposed to pretend it\u2019s not a big deal?\nPenny: That\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re gonna do because you\u2019re about to make me cry, and we both know if I start crying, you\u2019re gonna start crying.\nLeonard: You\u2019re right, you should go.\nPenny (crying): All right.\nLeonard (crying): She loves me. (Receives text) Hey, it\u2019s Alex. Nice having coffee with you. If you want to talk more, I\u2019m always available. Smiley face, smiley face. What a friendly girl.\nScene: The cafeteria.\nHoward: Okay, picture\u2019s up. Looks like the camera\u2019s working.\nRaj: That\u2019s good quality video.\nHoward: It better be. It\u2019s the spare camera for the Mars rover.\nRaj: How did you get your hands on that?\nHoward: Million dollar camera, ten dollar lock.\nRaj: Oh, my God, here he comes. This is it.\nHoward: What the hell is that thing?\nRaj: I don\u2019t know.\nSheldon (on screen): This is Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Experimental log. Wormhole generator test forty-four.\nHoward: Wormhole generator test? (On screen a wormhole appears)\nSheldon: The first forty-three parallel universes I\u2019ve checked proved to be empty. I see no reason to suspect universe number forty-four will be any different. (Puts his head in the wormhole)\nHoward: Oh, my God!\nRaj: Holy crap!\nSheldon (with an alien creature stuck to his face): Oh! It\u2019s eating my face!\nRaj: Aah! It\u2019s eating his face!\nSheldon (throwing alien onto the laptop): I found your webcam and replaced the video feed. You two should be ashamed of yourselves.\nRaj: Sheldon, we\u2019re really sorry.\nHoward: Yeah, really sorry.\nSheldon: Sorry? You may not realize it, but I have difficulty navigating certain aspects of daily life. You know, understanding sarcasm, feigning interest in others, not talking about trains as much as I want to. It\u2019s exhausting. Which is why, for twenty minutes a day, I like to go down to that room, turn my mind off and do what I need to do to recharge.\nHoward: But what are you doing in there?\nRaj: And what does forty-three mean?\nSheldon: You don\u2019t need to know, you don\u2019t deserve to know, and you will never know.\nRaj: Yeah, well, I know how to make your egg salad now.\nScene: The room in the basement. Sheldon enters, takes out a box, takes a beanbag from the box, then starts playing keepie-uppie,\nSheldon: One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight\u2026 Drat.

Amy broke his heart, the DVR cut off the last minute of Doctor Who. That crow followed him home.\nPenny: Aren\u2019t you worried you\u2019re making French toast on oatmeal day?\nLeonard: Ah, well, what\u2019s this? A pot of oatmeal? Or, thanks to you, what I will now call gloatmeal.\nPenny: Oh, I don\u2019t want credit for that.\nSheldon: Oh, Dr. and Mrs. Hofstadter, lovely to see you this fine morning.\nLeonard: You\u2019re in a good mood.\nSheldon: Yeah, I am indeed. I have decided, instead of wallowing in sadness about Amy, it is time that I find myself a new female companion.\nPenny: Oh. Good for you.\nLeonard: What brought this on?\nSheldon: I realized something. When Amy was in my life, I was hyper-focused on my work and ignored her.\nPenny: And you don\u2019t want to make the same mistake with the next woman.\nSheldon: No, I need a new woman in my life to ignore so I can hyper-focus on my work again.\nLeonard: Hey, I made French toast sticks.\nSheldon: On oatmeal day?\nLeonard: Ah, I also made oatmeal.\nSheldon: Ooh, that\u2019s a lot of carbohydrates for a man on the prowl. You know what? You eat it. You\u2019re married, it doesn\u2019t matter what you look like.\nPenny: Don\u2019t take advice from a man who threw his shoe at a crow.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Thank you for coming by, gentlemen.\nHoward: No problem.\nRaj: So what\u2019s up?\nSheldon: Well, it was the two of you who found Amy Farrah Fowler for me. Now that I\u2019m looking for my next girlfriend, it seemed only logical that I employ your services once again.\nHoward: You sure you\u2019re up for that? She did hurt you.\nSheldon: Oh, no, it\u2019s all right. I think of my time with Amy as a stick of Fruit Stripe gum. Sweet and enjoyable at first, but ultimately a flavourless lump of sadness.\nRaj: You\u2019re not wrong about Fruit Stripe. I was always a Hubba Bubba man.\nHoward: Hubba Bubba over Dubble Bubble? You\u2019re crazy.\nRaj: Hey, the jaw wants what it wants.\nSheldon: Gentlemen.\nRaj: Oh, right, uh, girlfriend. Okay.\nHoward: But what are you looking for?\nSheldon: All I\u2019m looking for is an educated, intelligent woman who shares my interests while retaining her own unique point of view. She should be kind, patient, and most important, unable to imagine life without me by ten o\u2019clock tonight.\nHoward: Isn\u2019t that a little unreasonable?\nSheldon: All right, fine, she doesn\u2019t need her own point of view. Now, chop-chop.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment.\nPenny: Come on, Amy, show us the dress.\nAmy: Okay. But I\u2019m really stepping outside of my comfort zone here.\nPenny: Uh, I don\u2019t think any of your comfort zones are showing.\nBernadette: Yeah, it\u2019s your third date, maybe you could go more sexy.\nAmy: Well, some people think the sexiest organ is the brain.\nPenny: No one ever bought me drinks at a bar because my brain just popped out of my shirt.\nAmy: Do you have any heels higher than this? He\u2019s pretty tall.\nPenny: Ooh.\nBernadette: Ooh, tall. Finally some details about this mystery man.\nPenny: Yeah, come on, tell us more.\nAmy: Well, I told you his name and that he\u2019s tall. What more do you need?\nBernadette: Did you kiss him yet?\nAmy: Just a little peck on the lips.\nPenny: Well, we\u2019re your best friends, give us one more detail and we promise we\u2019ll leave you alone.\nAmy: Fine. Um, he\u2019s British. All right, that is a juicy one.\nPenny: All right, where is tall British Dave taking you?\nBernadette: Tea and basketball?\nAmy: To that new Italian place on Walnut.\nBernadette: Oh, nice.\nAmy: I\u2019m gonna go look for other shoes.\nPenny: Good luck. I threw out all my tall ones when I married Leonard.\nBernadette: Hey, you want to swing by that place tonight and get a look at this guy?\nPenny: We don\u2019t even know what time they\u2019re gonna be there.\nBernadette: I\u2019ll just call the restaurant, pretend I\u2019m Amy and check the reservation.\nPenny: Damn, you\u2019re sneaky.\nBernadette: Yeah, but I\u2019m little, so it\u2019s adorable.\nScene: The apartment.\nHoward: I think the quickest way to find you a new girlfriend is just to get you on every dating Web site out there.\nSheldon: Are you sure? I\u2019ve heard that on those sites, often when you think you\u2019re corresponding with someone, it\u2019s actually a computer program pretending to be a real person.\nRaj: And you\u2019re afraid it\u2019ll do a better job than you?\nSheldon: Excuse me. No one does a better job pretending to be a person than I do. Siri comes close, but I know more jokes.\nHoward: If you don\u2019t want to use dating Web sites, what do you suggest?\nSheldon: Off the top of my head? Uh, prospective women weed themselves out in a battle of wits until only one champion remains, and she shows up at my door flush with the thrill of victory, and then sits quietly by my side while I watch Daredevil.\nHoward: You seriously think women would fight for you?\nSheldon: People compete for jobs and trophies, why not me?\nHoward: He\u2019s right, he knows a lot of jokes.\nRaj: Yeah, no, but it is basic human nature. If we present him as a prize, maybe they would.\nHoward: Well, he\u2019s smart, he\u2019s a respected scientist.\nSheldon: And I have the soulful eyes of a cow.\nRaj: I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d say you\u2026 oh.\nHoward: I have an idea. What if we put a post on Craigslist that says world-class Caltech physicist seeking girlfriend. If interested, solve the following puzzles for a chance to meet him.\nSheldon: Oh, we\u2019ll make the puzzles extremely challenging to eliminate unworthy candidates.\nRaj: Oh, we could set it up like a scavenger hunt where the last puzzle gives the winner Sheldon\u2019s contact information.\nHoward: Well, this is actually an interesting social experiment.\nRaj: I\u2019m a little jealous of the people who get to do it.\nHoward: Me, too. And we\u2019ve seen the prize.\nScene: The stairwell.\nLeonard: I don\u2019t understand why we\u2019re leaving so early for the movie.\nPenny: Oh, I forgot to tell you, we\u2019re gonna meet up with Bernadette to spy on Amy and her date.\nLeonard: What? I don\u2019t want to do that.\nPenny: What, and you think I want to see a documentary about aluminium can recycling?\nLeonard: This is the movie that big soda doesn\u2019t want you to see.\nPenny: No, it\u2019s the movie your wife doesn\u2019t want you to see.\nLeonard: So you\u2019re actually okay with invading your friend\u2019s privacy?\nPenny: You\u2019re not curious who she\u2019s out with?\nLeonard: Not really.\nPenny: But you\u2019re curious about aluminium cans?

The Sheldon Cooper Girlfriend Challenge is officially live.\nHoward: Congratulations.\nRaj: This is exciting.\nSheldon: Right now, somewhere, a woman is dividing the atomic weight of the best noble gas by the number of colours in the oldest national flag still in use.\nHoward: Then using that number as the average speed to calculate the travel time from Mordor to the Shire.\nSheldon: And, taking her first step towards a lifetime of laughter, love and, best of all, rules.\nRaj: I, I hope we didn\u2019t make the puzzles too hard.\nHoward: Well, if she can solve them, it\u2019ll prove she\u2019s intelligent, tenacious and so socially awkward she has nothing better to do on a Saturday night.\nSheldon: Golly, she sounds too good to be true.\nScene: A restaurant.\nTall British Dave: This is fun. I haven\u2019t dated much since my divorce.\nAmy: Well, I\u2019m having a good time, too. If you don\u2019t mind me asking, why did you and your wife split up?\nDave: Oh, you know how it is, we wanted different things. I wanted children, and she wanted a pastry chef named Jean-Philippe.\nAmy: Oh, I\u2019m, I\u2019m so sorry.\nDave: No, it\u2019s, it\u2019s fine. It\u2019s why I left England. It reminded me too much of her. Cold, gloomy and easily accessed by a Frenchman through a tunnel.\n(in the car outside)\nPenny: Hey. So, where are they?\nBernadette: Across the street, in the left window.\nPenny: Oh, damn it, we should have brought binoculars.\nBernadette: Right here.\nLeonard: You just happen to have those in the car?\nBernadette: Kinda. Before I met Howie, I liked to keep close tabs on my boyfriends.\nLeonard: By stalking them?\nBernadette: No. Stalkers are creepy. I\u2019m just a harmless little girl with military-grade spy equipment.\nPenny: Oh, there he is.\nBernadette: He\u2019s cute, right?\nPenny: Yeah.\nLeonard: Can I see?\nPenny: What, now you\u2019re interested? You didn\u2019t even want to come.\nLeonard: I know, but you guys make being a crappy friend look fun.\nPenny: Fine.\nLeonard: Yeah, okay, I see him. It looks like they\u2019re having a nice time. I wish I could hear what they\u2019re saying.\nBernadette: Yeah, I should\u2019ve brought my parabolic microphone.\nPenny: Your what?\nBernadette: Nothing. Not important.\nDave: So you\u2019ve never been married?\nAmy: No. I mean, to be completely honest, I\u2019ve, I\u2019ve only been in one long-term relationship.\nDave: Oh. What happened with that?\nAmy: That\u2019s a good question. After five years, it was just feeling like more work than it should be.\nDave: Oh, that\u2019s too bad. Was he a neurobiologist like you?\nAmy: No. He\u2019s a theoretical physicist at Caltech.\nDave: I love teaching math, but that would be my dream job. What\u2019s his focus?\nAmy: Um, used to be string theory, now it\u2019s dark matter. But let\u2019s not discuss Sheldon. Let\u2019s get back to you.\nDave: Wait, you\u2019re not talking about Dr. Sheldon Cooper?\nAmy: I\u2019m trying not to. Do you know him?\nDave: No, but I\u2019ve followed his work for years. He\u2019s a rock star. You\u2019ve got to tell me about him. What\u2019s he like?\nPenny: He really seems into her.\nBernadette: I took a video. I forgot how much fun this is.\nLeonard: Okay, we saw them. Can we go catch the movie?\nBernadette: Why\u2019d you bring him?\nPenny: I had to; we\u2019re married now.\nBernadette: Ugh, I hear that.\nDave: I\u2019m sorry, just one more question about Sheldon.\nAmy: Sure, why not?\nDave: It\u2019s more of a four-part question, really. When he wrote his paper on supersingular prime numbers, how long did it take?\nAmy: Um about an hour and half.\nDave: Wow. I mean, wow. And you were there to see it?\nAmy: Yes. Yep. We were on a date. Very much like this one.\nDave: Mm. I doubt it was like this one. I mean, he\u2019s a genius, and I wasn\u2019t even smart enough to figure out why my wife always smelled of croissants.\nAmy: What was the rest of your question?\nDave: Do you think you could introduce me to him?\nAmy: Really? You-you want me to introduce you to my ex-boyfriend?\nDave: You\u2019re right, it\u2019s, it\u2019s weird. No, wait. Do it. No. I changed my mind. I\u2019d be too nervous. Oh, I don\u2019t know what to do.\nLeonard: Are we gonna be much longer? I really have to go to the bathroom.\nBernadette: Right here.\nScene: The apartment.\nRaj: 37 minutes left until the deadline.\nSheldon: Someone will show.\nHoward: And no matter what happens, this is still a fun experiment.\nRaj: Not as fun as the night we blew up grapes in the microwave. We really have led full lives.\nSheldon: Someone will show.\nRaj: Maybe you don\u2019t want someone exactly like you. You know what they say, opposites attract.\nSheldon: Well, by that logic, I should be with someone short, dull and needy, eh? Not to cast aspersions, but I can\u2019t shake a stick around here without hitting that.\nScene: The restaurant.\nDave: You know, I once drove 500 miles to hear him speak at Stanford.\nAmy: I have a DVD of that lecture.\nDave: Really? Wasn\u2019t it great?\nAmy: Not as a Valentine\u2019s present, no.\nDave: Well, the next time you watch it, I\u2019m the bloke who asked the question that he said was stupid and obvious. It was the nicest thing he said to anyone there.\nAmy: That\u2019s, um, terrific. Listen, I\u2019m, I\u2019m kind of tired. Can we call it a night?\nDave: Oh, gosh. Sorry, I\u2019ve just spent the whole night talking about your ex-boyfriend. I\u2019m such an idiot.\nAmy: No, you\u2019re not.\nDave: Well, maybe not an idiot, but certainly not as smart as someone we won\u2019t mention.\nAmy: Thank you.\nDave: That you said you might introduce me to, I\u2019m free on Thursday.\nBernadette: Hey, hey, they\u2019re leaving.\nPenny: What? Here, give me, give me. Oh, my God. Oh, my God, they\u2019re coming right towards us.\nBernadette: We got to get out of here.\nPenny: Okay. Well, wait, what about Leonard?\nBernadette: He and his tiny bladder can take the bus. (Reverses into car behind)\nPenny: Oh, no.\nDave: She just hit my car.\nAmy: What are you guys doing here?\nBernadette: Hi, Ames, what are you doing here?\nLeonard: What happened?\nDave: O-M-G. Aren\u2019t you Leonard Hofstadter?\nLeonard: Yeah.\nDave: I saw you speak at Stanford with Sheldon Cooper. Amy, can you believe it? It\u2019s Dr. Leonard Hofstadter.\nAmy: No. Pinch me.\nDave: It\u2019s an absolute pleasure to meet you. Can I shake your hand?\nLeonard: I don\u2019t know if you want to do that, I was just, okay, never mind.\nDave: Amy, I\u2019m never washing this hand again.\nLeonard: You really should.\nScene: The apartment.\nRaj: Sixty seconds. This is not looking good.\nSheldon: One minute is a long time.\nHoward: I\u2019ve been telling women that for 20 years.\nRaj: Forty-five.\nSheldon: 45 seconds is plenty of time for a woman to walk through that door and fall in love with me. You know, probably half that if I break out the old cow eyes.\nRaj: Thirty seconds.\nSheldon: Uh-oh. What if it\u2019s Jennifer Lawrence?\nHoward: What?\nSheldon: Well, that last Hunger Games was not my cup of tea.\nHoward: You thought she was great in X-Men.\nSheldon: Oh, fine, I won\u2019t shut my heart to the love of Jennifer Lawrence.\nRaj: Guys, fifteen seconds.\nHoward: Maybe she\u2019s waiting to show up at the last possible moment.\nSheldon: Sounds like a drama queen. Oh, no. It is Jennifer Lawrence.\nRaj: Five, four, three, two, one. That\u2019s too bad.\nHoward: Maybe we did make the test too difficult.\nRaj: I don\u2019t think it matters. Look, Sheldon, I believe when the time is right for you to meet someone, it\u2019ll just happen. Okay? Not because of a test or a Web site, but because\u2026 (knock on door) we are the dreamers of dreams.\nHoward: It\u2019s an actual girl, and she\u2019s really pretty.\nRaj: Answer it.\nSheldon: All right. Can I help you?\nGirl: Um, are you the physicist that placed the ad on Craigslist?\nSheldon: Yes.\nGirl: Hi. I\u2019m Vanessa Bennett. Sorry it took a while for me to get here. I was stuck in this boring symposium on atomic spectroscopy when I came across your ad, and it saved my night. The puzzles were, were really fun. I\u2019ve never had to translate Klingon into ancient Sanskrit before.\nSheldon: Careful, it\u2019s addictive.\nVanessa: Chija\u201de\u2019vlKub je. Or, as they say in Sanskrit, Ahm asman matey-bee ta-teyva.\nSheldon: And just like that, you\u2019re a Klingon-Sanskrit junkie.\nVanessa: Anyway, I, I just, I knew I had to meet the person responsible for such a brilliant idea. And I don\u2019t need to tell you, there aren\u2019t a lot of men who love physics, archaic languages and flags of the world.\nSheldon: I am a bit of a unicorn. Well, you certainly seem like a special lady, uh, but as you know, you missed the deadline, so thanks for playing.\nRaj: How could you send her away?\nSheldon: She was late. And she found atomic spectroscopy boring. Well, I wouldn\u2019t coitus her with your genitals.\nScene: Amy\u2019s car.\nDave: Uh, thanks for driving me home.\nAmy: No problem. I\u2019m really sorry about your car.\nDave: Oh, it\u2019s all right. If you\u2019re free next weekend, I\u2019d love to take you out again.\nAmy: Um, listen, you\u2019re a really nice guy, but I just, I don\u2019t think this is working out.\nDave: Oh. Okay.\nAmy: I\u2019m, I\u2019m really sorry.\nDave: No, it\u2019s, at least the same woman that rejected Sheldon Cooper rejected me.\nAmy: There you go.\nDave: If I ever do meet him, we\u2019ll have that in common.\nAmy: Sure. Heh.\nDave: And, he\u2019s kissed you and I\u2019ve kissed you, so if you think about it\u2026\nAmy: Okay, get out.\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "1_16": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The Cheesecake Factory. Raj and Sheldon are arm wrestling while playing tetris. There is a cacophony of cries such as \u201ctake him down\u201d and \u201che\u2019s got you, Sheldon.\u201d\nPenny: Hey, guys, guys, some of the other waitresses wanted me to ask you something.\nLeonard: Oh, it\u2019s called trestling.\nHoward: It combines the physical strength of arm wrestling with the mental agility of tetris into the ultimate sport. \nPenny: Yeah, that\u2019s terrific, but what they wanted me to ask you was to cut it the hell out. (To someone off) Right come on guys, come on. (Singing while approaching another table) Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you\u2026\nSheldon: We might as well stop, it\u2019s a stalemate. You\u2019re beating me in tetris, but you\u2019ve got the upper body strength of a Keebler Elf.\nRaj: Keebler Elf? I\u2019ve got your Keebler Elf right here. (Strains to push Sheldon\u2019s arm down. Tries using both hands, still with no effect.) Okay, it\u2019s a stalemate. \nPenny: So Leonard, will we be seeing you on Saturday for your free birthday cheesecake?\nSheldon: He can\u2019t eat cheesecake, he\u2019s lactose intolerant. \nPenny: Okay, he can have carrot cake.\nSheldon: What about the cream cheese frosting.\nPenny: he can scrape it off. \nLeonard: Forget about the cake, how did you know that my birthday is Saturday? \nPenny: I did your horoscope, remember, I was going to do everybody\u2019s until Sheldon went on one of his typical psychotic rants.\nSheldon: For the record, that psychotic rant was a concise summation of the research of Bertram Forer, who in 1948 proved conclusively through meticulously designed experiments, that astrology is nothing but pseudo scientific hokum. \nPenny: Blah blah blah, a typical Taurus. So, seriously, are we going to see you Saturday?\nLeonard: Oh, I don\u2019t think so.\nPenny: Why not?\nLeonard: I don\u2019t celebrate my birthday.\nPenny: Shuddup, yeah you do. \nLeonard: No, it\u2019s no big deal, it\u2019s just the way I was raised. My parents focussed on celebrating achievements, and being expelled from a birth canal was not considered one of them.\nPenny: Uh, that\u2019s so silly.\nSheldon: It\u2019s actually based on very sound theories, his mother published a paper on it. \nPenny: What was it called, \u201cI hate my son and that\u2019s why he can\u2019t have cake?\u201d \nSheldon: It was obviously effective, Leonard grew up to be an experimental physicist. Perhaps if she\u2019d also denied him Christmas he\u2019d be a little better at it. \nLeonard: Thank you.\nHoward: Well I love birthdays, waking up to Mom\u2019s special French Toast breakfast, wearing the birthday king crown, playing laser tag with all my friends.\nPenny: Yeah, see, that\u2019s what kids should have. \nHoward: Actually that was last year. \nPenny: So you\u2019ve really never had a birthday party? \nLeonard: No. But it was okay. I mean, when I was little I\u2019d think maybe my parents would change their mind, and surprise me with a party, like this one birthday I came home from my Cello lesson, and I saw a lot of strange cars parked out front, and when I got to the door I could hear people whispering, and I could smell German chocolate cake, which is my favourite.\nPenny: And?\nLeonard: Uh, it turns out my grandfather had died. \u00a0\nPenny: Oh my God, that\u2019s terrible. \nLeonard: Oh, it was kind of like a birthday party. I got to see all my cousins and there was cake, so\u20267\nPenny: That\u2019s the saddest thing I\u2019ve ever heard. \nHoward: You think? Go ahead, tell her about your senior prom. \nCredits sequence.\nScene: Leonard is exiting the apartment. \nHoward (voice from inside): Make sure they remember no peanuts.\nLeonard: Howard, every Thai restaurant in town knows you can\u2019t eat peanuts. They see me coming they go \u201cah, no peanut boy!\u201d\n(Leonard exits down stairs. A moment later, Penny peeks out of her apartment, checks the coast is clear, and crosses the hall to the guys apartment. Knocks.)\nSheldon (answering): Hello Penny. Leonard just left.\nPenny: I know. I want to talk to you. \nSheldon: What would we talk about? We\u2019ve no overlapping areas of interest I\u2019m aware of, and you know I don\u2019t care for chit-chat. \nPenny: Okay, can you just let me in.\nSheldon: Well alright, but I don\u2019t see this as a promising endeavour.\nPenny: Okay, here\u2019s the deal, we are going to throw Leonard a kick-ass surprise party for his birthday on Saturday.\nSheldon: I hardly think so, Leonard made it very clear he doesn\u2019t want a party.\nHoward: Did someone say party? \nPenny: He just doesn\u2019t know he wants one because he\u2019s never had one. \nHoward: I suppose that\u2019s possible, but for the record, I\u2019ve never had a threesome and yet I still know I want one.\nPenny: Howard, here\u2019s the difference. The possibility exists that Leonard could have a birthday party before hell freezes over. \nHoward: Fine. If I do have a threesome, you can\u2019t be part of it. I\u2019m just kidding, yes you can. Can you bring a friend? \nSheldon: I think a birthday party is a terrible idea. I envy Leonard for growing up without that anguish. \nPenny: Anguish?\nSheldon: Year after year, I had to endure wearing conical hats while being forced into the crowded sweaty hell of bouncy castles, not to mention being blindfolded and spun towards a grotesque tailless donkey as the other children mocked my disorientation. \nPenny: Okay, sweetie, I understand you have scars that no non-professional can heal, but nevertheless we are going to throw Leonard a birthday party. \nSheldon: Have I pointed out that I am extremely uncomfortable with dancing, loud music and most other forms of alcohol induced frivolity. \nPenny: Nevertheless we are\u2026.\nSheldon: In addition I really don\u2019t think that Leonard wants a\u2026\nPenny: Okay, here\u2019s the deal, you either help me throw Leonard a birthday party or, so help me God, I will go into your bedroom and I will unbag all of your most valuable mint condition comic books. And on one of them, you won\u2019t know which, I\u2019ll draw a tiny happy face in ink. \nSheldon: You can\u2019t do that, if you make a mark on a mint comic book it\u2019s no longer mint.\nPenny: Sheldon, do you understand the concept of blackmail?\nSheldon: Well of course I\u2026 oh! Yeah, I have an idea, let\u2019s throw Leonard a kick ass birthday party.\nScene: Howard and Raj sneak up the stairwell carrying presents. Howard knocks on Penny\u2019s door, a combination of two knocks, two knocks, one knock. Nothing happens. He tries again. Sheldon opens the door. \nSheldon: That\u2019s not the secret knock. This is the secret knock. (He knocks two, one, two.)\nHoward: What difference does it make?\nSheldon: The whole point of a secret knock is to establish a non-verbal signal to verify the identity of one\u2019s co-conspirators. \nPenny: Is that Raj and Howard?\nSheldon: Possibly, but unverified.\nHoward: Can you just let us in.\nSheldon: Luckily for you this is not a nuclear reactor. \nPenny: So, what did you get the birthday boy?\nHoward: Well, Raj got him an awesome limited edition Dark Knight sculpture based on Alex Ross\u2019s definitive Batman, and I got him this amazing autographed copy of the Feynman lectures on physics.\nPenny: Nice. I got him a sweater. \nHoward: Okay, well, he might like that, I\u2019ve seen him\u2026 chilly. \nPenny: Uh, Sheldon, I didn\u2019t see your present.\nSheldon: That\u2019s because I didn\u2019t bring one.\nPenny: Well why not? \nHoward: Don\u2019t ask.\nSheldon: The entire institution of gift giving makes no sense.\nHoward: Too late.\nSheldon: Let\u2019s say that I go out and I spend fifty dollars on you, it\u2019s a laborious activity, because I have to imagine what you need, whereas you know what you need. Now I can simplify things, just give you the fifty dollars directly and, you could give me fifty dollars on my birthday, and so on until one of us dies leaving the other one old and fifty dollars richer. And I ask you, is it worth it? \nHoward: Told you not to ask. \nPenny: Well, Sheldon, you\u2019re his friend. Friends give each other presents.\nSheldon: I accept your premise, I reject your conclusion.\nHoward: Try telling him it\u2019s a non-optional social convention. \nPenny: What?\nHoward: Just do it. \nPenny: It\u2019s a non-optional social convention.\nSheldon: Oh. Fair enough. \nHoward: He came with a manual. \nSheldon: Question, how am I going to get Leonard a present before the party? I don\u2019t drive, and the only things available within walking distance are a Thai restaurant and a gas station. I suppose I could wrap up an order of mee krob and a couple of lottery scratchers. \nPenny: Okay, let\u2019s do this, um, I will drive Sheldon to get a present, and Howard, you need to get rid of Leonard for about two hours. \nHoward: No problem.\nPenny: And then Raj, you bring the stuff across the hall and start setting up.\nHoward (after Raj whispers in his ear): What if guests show up?\nPenny: Entertain them.\nHoward: What if they\u2019re women?\nPenny: Stare at them and make them feel uncomfortable. \nScene: The apartment. Leonard is playing an X-Box game. \nHoward (entering): Hey!\nLeonard: Hey. \nHoward: How\u2019s it going?\nLeonard: Fine. \nHoward: So, listen, the New Art is showing the revised definitive cut of Blade Runner.\nLeonard: Seen it.\nHoward: No, you\u2019ve seen the 25th anniversary final cut. This one has eight seconds of previously unseen footage. They say it completely changes the tone of the film. \nLeonard: Oh. Pass. \nHoward: Come on, afterwards there\u2019s a Q & A with Harrison Ford\u2019s body double. \nLeonard: Look, I am in the Halo battle of my life here, there\u2019s this kid in Copenhagen, he has no immune system so all he does is sit in his bubble and play Halo 24/7.\nHoward: Can\u2019t you play him some other time?\nLeonard: Not if you believe his doctors. \nHoward: Oh my God, do you smell gas.\nLeonard: No.\nHoward: Yeah, no. \nScene: An electrical store.\nPenny: Alright, you know they have DVDs over there.\nSheldon: Yes, but they have DVD burners over here. Leonard needs a DVD burner. \nPenny: Sheldon, a gift shouldn\u2019t be something someone needs, it should be something fun, you know, something they wouldn\u2019t buy for themselves.\nSheldon: You mean, like a sweater? \nPenny: Well, it\u2019s a fun sweater, it\u2019s got a bold geometric print. \nSheldon: Is it the geometry that makes it fun.\nPenny: Okay, the point is, one of the ways we show we care about people is by putting thought and imagination into the gifts we give them. \nSheldon: Okay, I see, so not a DVD burner.\nPenny: Exactly.\nSheldon: Something he wouldn\u2019t buy for himself. Something fun. Something like\u2026 oh, an 802.11n wireless router. \nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: Here you go, Copenhagen boy, how about a taste of Hans Christian Hand Grenade. (Raj enters carrying party supplies. Howard waves him away while in the background Leonard is heard saying \u201coh, that did not feel good.\u201d) Come on, come on, oh you clever little\u2026. Come on, come on, take that! \nHoward (picks up a granola bar from the table, breaks off half and puts it in his back pocket.): Oh-oh. (Louder) Oh-oh! \nLeonard: What\u2019s the matter?\nHoward: This granola bar, there\u2019s peanuts in it.\nLeonard: Oh my God, why did you eat it?\nHoward: I don\u2019t know, it was just there.\nLeonard: Well if I had a gun there, would you have shot yourself? \nHoward: Don\u2019t yell at me, I\u2019ve got to go to the emergency room. \nLeonard: Now?\nHoward: No, after my tongue has swollen to the size of a brisket. \nLeonard: Alright, um, just, uh, let me get my keys.\nHoward: Oh God, oh God, oh God, oh\u2026. (into phone after Leonard leaves room) The laundry is out of the hamper. (Looks exasperated) Okay Sheldon, what was it supposed to be? Fine, it\u2019s out of the washer. I\u2019ll call you when it\u2019s in the dryer. \nLeonard (running in): Alright, let\u2019s go. (They exit, with Howard making croaking noises.) \nScene: The store. Sheldon is looking at two routers.\nSheldon: What do you think.\nPenny (pointing randomly): Um, that one. \nSheldon: Because of the two additional Ethernet ports.\nPenny: Sure.\nSheldon: He doesn\u2019t need them, he\u2019s already got a 640 connect switch \nPenny: Oh, okay then this one. \nSheldon: Why? \nPenny: I don\u2019t know, the man on the box looks so happy. \nSheldon: Penny! If I\u2019m going to buy Leonard a gift, I\u2019m going to do it right. I refuse to let him experience the same childhood trauma I did. \nPenny: Oh, I know I\u2019m going to regret this but, what trauma? \nSheldon: On my twelfth birthday I really wanted a titanium centrifuge, so, you know, I could separate radioactive isotopes. \nPenny: Of course.\nSheldon: Instead of a titanium centrifuge, my parents bought me\u2026 wow, this is hard. They got me\u2026 a motorised dirt bike. \nPenny: No? \nSheldon: What twelve year old boy wants a motorised dirt bike? \nPenny: All of them.\nSheldon: Really?\nPenny: Yeah.\nSheldon: Huh? \nPenny: Okay, so we\u2019re getting this one?\nSheldon: Yeah, I suppose. \nPenny: Okay, let\u2019s go.\nRandom woman: Excuse me, do you know anything about this stuff? \nSheldon: I know everything about this stuff.\nWoman: Okay, I have my own wholesale flower business, and I want to hook up my computer in the front entrance with the one in my refrigerated warehouse. \nPenny: Here, buy this one. Look, it\u2019s the one we\u2019re getting, see, happy guy available. \nSheldon: No, no, no, no, she doesn\u2019t want that, she needs a point to point peer network with a range extender.\nWoman: Thank you. \nRandom guy: Which hard drive do I want, firewire or USB?\nSheldon: It depends on what Bus you have.\nGuy: I drive a Chevy Cavalier.\nSheldon: Oh, dear lord.\nPenny: Sheldon, we have to go.\nSheldon: Not now, Penny, this poor man needs me. (To woman approaching) You hold on, I\u2019ll be right with you. What computer do you have, and please don\u2019t say a white one?\nScene: The hospital. Howard runs in and up to the counter.\nHoward: Excuse me.\nNurse: Fill this out, have a seat. \nHoward: No, listen, see we\u2019re throwing my friend a surprise party and I\u2019m supposed to keep him out of his apartment for two hours.\nNurse: Uh-huh, fill this out and have a seat. \nHoward: No, see, the only way I could get him to leave is to tell him I ate a peanut. Because I\u2019m allergic to peanuts. \nNurse: Oh, well in that case fill this out and have a seat. \nHoward: Look, all I need from you is to take me in the back and give me a band-aid so I can pretend I had a shot of epinephrine and they you tell my friend you need to keep me under observation for about an hour, hour and a half. \nNurse: Is that all you need?\nHoward: Yes.\nNurse: Get out of my ER. \nHoward: No, you don\u2019t understand.\nNurse: Oh, I understand, but unfortunately this hospital is not equipped to treat stupid. \nHoward: Okay, I get it, I know how the world works, how about if I were to introduce you (holding up a five dollar bill) to the man who freed your people. \nNurse, unless my people were freed by Benjamin Franklin and his five twin brothers you are wasting your time. \nLeonard (running in): Hey, sorry I couldn\u2019t find a parking spot, how are you doing.\nHoward: Bad, very bad. \nLeonard: Really, \u2018cos you don\u2019t look like you\u2019re swelling up at all, maybe we should just pick up some benedryl at the drug store and go home. \nHoward: We can\u2019t go home. \nLeonard: Why not?\nHoward: Becauth (pretends tongue has swollen up) Becauth-th-th. Brissket, Brissket! Water, need water. \nLeonard: Alright, I\u2019ll be right back. \nHoward (into phone): Penny, look, I\u2019ve got a problem.\nPenny (with Sheldon in background at the head of a large queue of customers): Yeah, well so do I, look you\u2019ve got to stall Leonard a little longer.\nHoward: I don\u2019t think I can. \nPenny: You have to, we all have to be there at the same time to yell \u201csurprise!\u201d \nHoward: Okay, you have to understand something, we\u2019re in a hospital right now. \nPenny: Why, is Leonard okay.\nHoward: Leonard\u2019s fine. I\u2019m fine, thanks for asking, by the way. \nPenny: Okay, I don\u2019t need your attitude, just hold him there a little longer. \nHoward: Look, I\u2019ve done my best but he wants to go home and I don\u2019t know how to stop him. \nPenny: Okay, how about this. You keep him there a little longer and when you get to the party I\u2019ll point out which of my friends are easy. \nHoward: Don\u2019t toy with me, woman. \nPenny: I\u2019ve got a hot former fat girl with no self-esteem, I\u2019ve got a girl who punishes her father by sleeping around and an alcoholic who\u2019s two tequila shots away from letting you wear her like a hat. \nHoward: Thy will be done. (Thinks. Reaches into back pocket, finds the half a granola bar from earlier. Looks down.) I\u2019m doing this for you, little buddy. (Takes a bite.)\nScene: The store. Sheldon is on the in-store computer. \nSheldon: Okay, we don\u2019t have that in stock, but I can special order it for you.\nPenny (with shop assistant, points at Sheldon): Him.\nAssistant: Excuse me, sir, you don\u2019t work here. \nSheldon: Yes, well, apparently neither does anyone else. \nPenny: Sheldon, we have to go.\nSheldon: Why? \nPenny: Well, for one thing, we\u2019re late for Leonard\u2019s birthday party. And for another, I told him to call security. \nSheldon (to customer): Good luck. (To assistant) By the way, a six year-old could hack your computer system. \nPenny: Keep walking.\nSheldon: Yeah, 1-2-3-4 is not a secure password. \nScene: The hospital.\nLeonard: Excuse me, my friend is having an allergic reaction to peanuts.\nNurse: No he\u2019s not.\nLeonard: Yes he is.\nNurse: Look, sir we are very busy here and I just don\u2019t\u2026 (sees Leonard whose face has swollen all over) holy crap! \nHoward: Pees hep me! \nNurse: Code 4, I need a gurney, right away, right away.\nHoward: Fank-u. \nScene: The stairwell. \nLeonard: Say what you will about the healthcare system in this country, but when they\u2019re afraid of lawsuits they sure test everything. \nHoward: I really don\u2019t think the colonoscopy was necessary. \nLeonard: You know, before you got all swollen up, I actually thought you were trying to keep me out of the apartment so you could throw me a surprise party. \nHoward: Oh, right, it\u2019s your birthday, I had no idea it was your birthday, I completely forgot, wow, what a lousy way to spend a birthday, well it\u2019s all over now.\nLeonard: There is a party, isn\u2019t there.\nHoward: Maybe.\nLeonard: Howard. \nHoward: Are you mad?\nLeonard: how could I be mad? You actually risked your life because you cared about me.\nHoward: Yeah, that\u2019s why I did it. \nLeonard: Alright. Here we go. My first birthday party. \n(Opens door. Raj is drunkenly singing True Colors very badly into a microphone with his shirt off and a bandana round his head while waving a beer bottle. Penny and Sheldon are asleep on the couch and armchair respectively.) \nRaj: Dude! Everybody left an hour ago! Surprise! \nTime shift. View of a mobile phone video screen. Raj has a woman sitting on his shoulders.\nRaj: Okay Leonard, here I am at your birthday party, I don\u2019t know where you are dude, but it\u2019s really kick-ass. Everyone is very very drunk, and uh\u2026 (girl pours booze into his mouth) Oh look, there\u2019s a girl taking her shirt off. \nPenny: That\u2019s my friend Carol. Remind me, I\u2019ve got to introduce her to Howard. \nRaj: Oh sweet Krishna, shake it, that-a rupee maker.\nPenny: I\u2019m so sorry you didn\u2019t get your party.\nLeonard: Oh, it\u2019s okay.\nPenny: Happy birthday anyways. (She kisses him full on the lips.)\nLeonard: Hey Penny, when, uh, when\u2019s your birthday?\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "7_8": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The apartment\nPenny: Hey, can I ask you a question?\nLeonard: Sure.\nPenny: You\u2019ve had this dart board since I\u2019ve known you, but I\u2019ve never seen you play.\nLeonard: Oh, uh, we played, once. I broke a window.\nPenny: What window?\nLeonard: That one over there.\nSheldon: Leonard, where are the Skee-Ball tickets?\nLeonard: Skee-Ball tickets?\nSheldon: Yeah, from when we went to the arcade three years ago? I finally decided what prize I want. Hurry up.\nLeonard: Uh, if I still have them, they\u2019re probably in the junk box.\nPenny: Ooh, what are you gonna get?\nSheldon: None of your business. But when you see me wearing a flower in my lapel later, you are most welcome to sniff it.\nLeonard: Yup, oh, here you go.\nSheldon: Oh, thank you. Here, get yourself an eraser for your troubles.\nLeonard: Oh. I forgot about this. My aunt made it for me when I started college.\nPenny: Aw, did she hate you?\nLeonard: Why? Because I got an ugly, itchy sweater, and my brother got a car? No, I was her favorite.\nSheldon: I seem to be a few tickets short. Are there more in the box?\nLeonard: Hmm, I think I got them all. Nope, they\u2019re not in there.\nSheldon: Well, you barely looked. Let me see.\nLeonard: No, no, no, I, I looked, and there\u2019s, there\u2019s, there\u2019s no more tickets.\nSheldon: Leonard, let me look in the box.\nLeonard: Okay, okay. I\u2019m gonna show you what\u2019s in the box. But just promise not to flip out.\nSheldon: Why would I flip out? Is it a spider? It\u2019s a spider.\nPenny: No, if it was a spider, Lenny would\u2019ve flipped out.\nLeonard: Okay, Sheldon, I know I was supposed to return this DVD a long time ago, and I know we rented it on your card. But it\u2019s been, like, seven years and clearly nothing bad has happened. So in-in-in-instead of being a giant pain in the ass like you always are, what if this one time you just tried staying calm?\nSheldon: That seems like a reasonable request. Although so did, hey, Leonard, would you mind returning that DVD?\nLeonard: I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ll, I\u2019ll take care of it.\nSheldon: Okay.\nLeonard: I mean it, I\u2019m going to.\nSheldon: I believe you.\nLeonard: And you\u2019re going to stay calm?\nSheldon: I said I would.\nLeonard: How about that? Sheldon\u2019s being reasonable.\nPenny: Yeah, it\u2019s freaking me out. I\u2019m gonna go.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: So, when you say you\u2019re not going to freak out about the DVD, here\u2019s what that means. Don\u2019t fixate on it. Don\u2019t wake me up in the middle of the night. Or nag me through the door while I\u2019m on the toilet.\nSheldon: Okay, first, talking to you while you\u2019re on the toilet isn\u2019t exactly a picnic for me either, okay? Remember, when you can hear me, I can hear you. And second, you completely disregard how uncomfortable unresolved issues are for me. It\u2019s, it\u2019s like, a, an itch in my brain I can\u2019t scratch.\nLeonard: When I broke my arm I used to stick a coat hanger down there. You ever try that? Maybe go in through the ear?\nSheldon: You wouldn\u2019t make jokes if you could feel the way I feel.\nLeonard: Well, I don\u2019t know how to do that.\nSheldon: How about this? I promise I won\u2019t pester you about the DVD. You can defecate in peace. That\u2019s a win for both of us. But, until this matter is resolved, I would like you to wear this sweater. With nothing underneath it.\nLeonard: That\u2019s stupid. Why?\nSheldon: You say it\u2019s itchy and uncomfortable. I say situations like this make me feel the same way. \nLeonard: I\u2019m telling you, try the hanger.\nSheldon: Put it on. Let\u2019s share the experience.\nLeonard: You got it. If this sweater shuts you up, I\u2019m gonna make a fortune selling them to everyone we know. Now all I need to do is head down to the video store and return the DVD.\nSheldon: Oh, did I forget to tell you? That store went out of business years ago.\nLeonard: Really?\nSheldon: How those nipples feeling, chief?\nScene: The cheesecake factory bar.\nBernadette: Penny, can we please get our drinks?\nPenny: Yeah, hang on, just give me sec.\nAmy: At work today, I did an in vivo stereotaxic surgery.\nBernadette: Cool. At my lab, I performed ten laser capture micro-dissections.\nPenny: I scraped gum off the bottom of that table. Only \u2019cause my manager saw me put it there.\nAmy: Oh, my gosh. That\u2019s the girl that broke Rajesh\u2019s heart.\nBernadette: That\u2019s Lucy?\nPenny: I don\u2019t know why but I always pictured her as Indian.\nBernadette: I think that reason\u2019s called racism.\nPenny: I\u2019m gonna go talk to her.\nBernadette: Why? What are you gonna say?\nPenny: I\u2019m not gonna say anything. I just want to check her out. Because she hurt my friend. My Indian friend. Who\u2019s racist now?\nBernadette: You because you just called him your Indian friend.\nPenny: Yeah, well, you\u2019re short.\nAmy: We\u2019re never getting our drinks.\nBernadette: No, but we knew that.\nPenny: Hey, can I start you off with something to drink?\nLucy: Oh, water would be great.\nPenny: Okay. Um, you\u2019re Lucy, right? I\u2019m a friend of Raj Koothrappali\u2019s. Actually Amy recognized you.\nLucy: Wow. How\u2019s he doing?\nPenny: Oh, you know, he\u2019s good.\nLucy: Great.\nPenny: Yeah, this is none of my business. But why did you break up with him in an e-mail?\nLucy: Oh, I don\u2019t know. I guess I thought it would be easier.\nPenny: Yeah, I get that. I\u2019ll go get you your water. When you say easier, you mean easier for you, right? \u2018Cause it certainly didn\u2019t make it easier for him.\nLucy: Any chance I can get a different waitress?\nPenny: I\u2019m sorry, this is rude of me. I will go get that water. See, see, see, see. Just now you expressed your feelings to my face. How come you could do that with me, but not Raj?\nLucy: I don\u2019t know your e-mail.\nPenny: You know what the worst part is? You\u2019re sitting here, perfectly happy and he\u2019s at home, a blubbering mess.\nLucy: Oh, I thought you said he was okay.\nPenny: Well, I also said I was getting you water, but look at me still standing here. You know, I may be a bad waitress, but you are a bad person. Now, you want to hear the specials?\nScene: The apartment.\nHoward: So, you can never take it off?\nLeonard: No.\nRaj: Not even to sleep?\nLeonard: No.\nHoward: So, you\u2019re just an idiot?\nLeonard: It\u2019s called proving a point.\nHoward: Is the point that you\u2019re an idiot?\nSheldon: Gentlemen, please. Leonard is trying to walk a mile in my metaphorical shoes. He can\u2019t walk in my actual shoes. He has the feet of a toddler.\nRaj: So, how are you gonna return the DVD if the store went out of business?\nLeonard: Monday morning I\u2019ll go downtown, look up the owner\u2019s information and send him the DVD. Pay the late fee, and prove to Sheldon that you can have a problem and solve it without acting like a complete lunatic. Ah!\nHoward: And the man impersonating a bear would like everyone to know that only you can prevent forest fires.\nRaj: I don\u2019t get it.\nHoward: You didn\u2019t have Smokey the Bear in India?\nRaj: No. Oh, is he anything like, uh, Mun-Mun the Mongoose? He taught us not to play with cobras.\nHoward: You had to be taught not to play with cobras?\nRaj: You had to be taught not to burn down the forest?\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment.\nPenny: Hey, if you guys were hungry, why didn\u2019t you order something at the restaurant?\nBernadette: We did, you never brought it.\nPenny: Oh, that\u2019s right. Nachos and a turkey club.\nAmy: Not even close.\nPenny: Well, I was too busy standing up for my friend to worry about your, I want to say salmon.\nAmy: You want to say sorry.\nBernadette: So, how are you gonna tell Raj abut what you did?\nPenny: What do you mean how? What\u2019s the big deal?\nAmy: You told Lucy he was a pathetic mess.\nBernadette: Then you made her cry and leave.\nPenny: Okay, you guys are overreacting. Raj is gonna appreciate how I had his back.\nScene: The same, later.\nRaj: What is wrong with you, Penny? You ruined any chance I had of getting back with Lucy. Now she knows I\u2019m a desperate mess instead of just being pretty sure. (Phone text sound) It\u2019s Lucy. She wants to meet for coffee. I love you, Penny.\nScene: Sheldon\u2019s office.\nHoward: Hey, what\u2019re you working on?\nSheldon: I\u2019m thinking about how one could use the fact that a rapidly rotating mirror turns virtual photons into real ones as a method of observing dark energy.\nHoward: That\u2019s a pretty cool idea.\nSheldon: Yeah. It\u2019s great you\u2019re here. I\u2019d love to get an engineer\u2019s opinion.\nHoward: Sure.\nSheldon: This chair is squeaky. Now, do I fix it or get a new one?\nLeonard: Well, Sheldon, it took me all morning, but I found the owner of the video store. And I am happy to report that he died peacefully in his sleep, drunk at the bottom of a pool. Anyway, there is no one to return the DVD to, so this issue is resolved. Ah! And I\u2019d just like to point out that even though the sweater was uncomfortable, I didn\u2019t use it as an excuse to antagonize everyone around me.\nHoward: You know, you could reimburse the video store owner\u2019s next of kin.\nLeonard: Or it\u2019s resolved.\nSheldon: Hey, that next of kin thing sounds pretty good.\nHoward: I believe this is yours.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s apartment.\nRaj: Can I ask you guys a question? So, I\u2019m seeing Lucy tomorrow night, and I\u2019ve never hung out with someone who broke up with me. How do you do it?\nHoward: You can\u2019t let her know you\u2019re hurting. You know, the key is confidence.\nRaj: Why is the key always confidence? How come it\u2019s never love handles and flop sweat?\nBernadette: If this girl hurt you so much, are you sure you want to see her again?\nHoward: Well, if I may, he has so little self-respect and is so desperate for the smallest crumb of affection, she could literally sleep with his own father in his own bed and post the video to YouTube, and he\u2019d still buy her flowers and ask her to be his bride.\nRaj: He\u2019s right. But in my defence, if we could survive that, we could survive anything.\nBernadette: Well, if you\u2019re sure you want to do this, it\u2019s only coffee, just relax and see what happens.\nRaj: Well, can I say she looks nice?\nBernadette: Sure.\nRaj: Can I tell her I miss her?\nBernadette: Maybe, if she asks.\nRaj: Oh, can I show her an oil painting I made of us surrounded by our children and grandchildren?\nBernadette: I\u2019d save that for the second date.\nRaj: Good, good. \u2018Cause no matter how hard I try, I cannot get the twins to look alike.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment.\nPenny: What are you doing?\nLeonard: Oh, I\u2019m just trying to find the stupid next of kin to this stupid video store owner so I can return the DVD and see the look on Sheldon\u2019s stupid face when he sees that I didn\u2019t let this get to me.\nPenny: Sheldon\u2019s not here. Why don\u2019t you take the sweater off?\nLeonard: There\u2019s a principle at stake.\nPenny: Which is?\nLeonard: Oh, I don\u2019t know. Who cares? Look at me.\nPenny: Oh, my God! Is that sweater made of bees? Come on, take it off. I won\u2019t tell.\nLeonard: No, no, honey, if I take it off, Sheldon wins.\nPenny: Sweetie, every night you don\u2019t kill him in his sleep, he wins.\nLeonard: No, it\u2019s, it\u2019s almost done. I just, I have to find the next of kin, and send \u2019em the DVD and then just wait for someone with my complexion to die so I can get a skin graft.\nPenny: Smile.\nLeonard: What is that? What is that for?\nPenny: So you can send it to Princeton and get your money back.\nScene: The apartment.\nAmy: I must say, Sheldon, you\u2019re handling this DVD business with an impressive amount of maturity.\nSheldon: I don\u2019t know why that surprises you. I\u2019m a grown man. As should be evident by this sport coat and very real flower in my lapel.\nAmy: Is there some kind of new coping mechanism you\u2019re employing?\nSheldon: The more interesting question you should be asking is, what does this flower smell like?\nAmy: I\u2019m gonna go with sad. So what\u2019s the story with you and this DVD?\nSheldon: There\u2019s nothing to tell. Maybe I purchased a book entitled Don\u2019t Sweat the Small Stuff and I followed its wise suggestions, one of which was stop and smell the flowers.\nAmy: Seriously?\nSheldon: Please. Ha-ha, Oh.\nScene: A coffee shop.\nLucy: Hi.\nRaj: Hello. Oh, it\u2019s so good to see you.\nLucy: You, too.\nRaj: Please, sit. I, uh, I got you a cappuccino. I remembered it was your favourite. I also got crumb cake, but I remembered it was my favourite and I ate it. Anyway, uh, how are you?\nLucy: I\u2019m pretty good. Listen, I just wanted to apologize for breaking up with you in an e-mail.\nRaj: Well, and I ate all the crumb cake. We both made mistakes.\nLucy: Okay.\nRaj: I\u2019m so happy you asked me here, and I hope we can hang out again sometime. You know, as friends, lovemaking partners, whatever.\nLucy: Oh, uh, I\u2019m kind of seeing someone.\nRaj: I think I know the answer to this, but just to be clear, it\u2019s not me, right?\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment. \nRaj: This is all your fault, I should\u2019ve listened to Mun-Mun because I\u2019ve been playing with a cobra and her name is Penny. Why are you so cruel? Do you enjoy my pain?\nPenny: There\u2019s a girl at the Cheesecake Factory I can set you up with.\nRaj: I love you, Penny.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: How is it I can conceptualize a methodology of examining dark matter in the universe but can\u2019t figure out how to fix a novelty squirt flower?\nAmy: I think the real question is, why do you waste your time with cheap, childish pranks?\nSheldon: There\u2019s probably a deep reason. Which I\u2019d be happy to discuss with you over some peanut brittle in a can.\nLeonard: Okay, Sheldon, I am out of options. Video store owner, Nursis Manookian, has no next of kin.\nSheldon: Well, you seem hot under the collar, or is that the sweater?\nLeonard: Oh, oh, no, no. It\u2019s because I spent all afternoon at the Armenian church where his funeral mass was held. According to Father Solakian, no one attended. Luckily, my trip wasn\u2019t a complete waste. I lit a candle and prayed for your death but I\u2019m not Armenian, so it probably won\u2019t work. This is over, right?\nSheldon: Oh, not necessarily. I suggest you look for long-lost relatives either in Armenia or Lebanon.\nLeonard: Listen to me, Sheldon. I am not going to Lebanon to return Super Mario Brothers the movie.\nSheldon: You know, it might be fun. You love hummus.\nLeonard: Why isn\u2019t this bothering you? Isn\u2019t your brain getting itchy? This is on your card. This could be ruining your credit score. Why isn\u2019t this making you crazy?\nSheldon: Leonard, I have something to tell you, but I want you to promise not to flip out.\nLeonard: What?\nSheldon: Seven years ago, I found out the DVD was late and I paid for it.\nLeonard: What?\nSheldon: I was going to mention it at the time, but then I thought, some day, this might be a teachable moment.\nLeonard: Aaaah! I, you, how can, what!\nAmy: Sheldon, that was diabolical.\nSheldon: I know. And it wasn\u2019t easy. Do you have any idea what it\u2019s like to wait for years and never know if you\u2019re going to finally get satisfaction?\nScene: A coffee shop.\nRaj: Wow. You\u2019re even prettier than Penny said. I can\u2019t believe a girl like you doesn\u2019t have a boyfriend.\nGirl: Well, I don\u2019t.\nRaj: I don\u2019t believe you, you\u2019re lying to me. \nGirl: What?\nRaj: Oh, it\u2019s okay. I have no morals and I\u2019m desperately lonely. I\u2019ll be the other man if you want a little something-something on the side.\nScene: The cheesecake factory.\nGirl (to Penny): What is wrong with you?\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment.\nPenny (to Raj): What is wrong with you?\nScene: Raj\u2019s apartment.\nRaj (to a mirror): What is wrong with you?\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "5_24": "\n\t\t\t\tFollowing a \u201cPreviously on The Big Bang Theory\u201d section\nScene: A Soyuz Spaceship capsule.\nMission Control (in Russian): Launch step twelve reading okay.\nCosmonaut (in Russian): Launch step twelve acknowledged.\nHoward: Hey Mike?\nMike Massimino: Yeah.\nHoward: I changed my mind. I don\u2019t want to do this.\nMike: Good one.\nHoward: Yeah, I\u2019m a funny guy. I also have a hysterical bit planned for later where I pretend to cry through the whole launch.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: Sheldon, what channel is NASA TV?\nSheldon: 289, right between the Game Show Network at 288 and the East coast feed of the Disney Channel on 290.\nAmy: I love his eidetic memory, it\u2019s so sexy. Sheldon, what are the ingredients in Pringles?\nSheldon: Dried potatoes, vegetable oil, corn flower, wheat starch, maltodextrin, salt, and my favourite ingredient of all, uniformity.\nAmy: The uterus quivers, does it not?\nLeonard: There\u2019s Howard\u2019s rocket, live from Kazakhstan.\nBernadette: Oh, God, I\u2019m so nervous. I don\u2019t think I can watch.\nRaj: You\u2019re nervous? I\u2019ve been stress-eating for four days. Look at me. I\u2019m wearing my fat pants.\nSheldon: Remarkable. In just under a half hour, 200 metric tons of fuel will ignite in a controlled explosion right beneath Howard\u2019s keister. And all from a country whose entire contribution to the global economy, has been Tetris and mail-order brides.\nBernadette: Give me those damn Pringles.\nScene: Soyuz capsule.\nCosmonaut (in Russian): Are all of the systems of the ship ready?\nMission Control: Da.\nMike: Okay, we\u2019re in the final countdown. How you doing over there?\nHoward: Good! Good! Oh, quick question, I missed it in the briefing. How much urine do these suits hold?\nCredits sequence.\nScene: Soyuz capsule.\nMike: Hey, Froot Loops, want to hit your fan switch?\nHoward: Check.\nCosmonaut: He calls you Froot Loops because of your very gay haircut?\nHoward: No, it\u2019s \u2019cause I live with my mom and she makes me Froot Loops.\nCosmonaut: Go with gay story, people are more accepting of that.\nMike: Actually, Froot Loops just got married to a girl.\nCosmonaut: Congratulations.\nHoward: Thanks, we decided to do it before the launch.\nCosmonaut: You and Mrs. Loops have a big wedding?\nHoward: Not exactly. Listen, if you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019m not really up for chatting. I\u2019m just going to sit here quietly and let my life flash before my eyes. That went really quick. Let me try it again.\nScene: Howard\u2019s bedroom.\nHoward: Close your eyes. Put out your hand. I got you something special.\nBernadette: Come on, Howard. I\u2019m not falling for that again.\nHoward: No, here.\nBernadette: Oh, Howie. A little star, it\u2019s beautiful. Put it on me.\nHoward: Okay, but I\u2019m going to have to get it back from you so I can take it to the International Space Station. That way, when I come home, you will have a star that was actually in space.\nBernadette: Oh, my God.\nHoward: Take that, every guy who\u2019s ever bought you anything.\nBernadette: This is the most amazing gift I\u2019ve ever gotten.\nHoward: Really? Well, if you like it that much, then close your eyes and put out your hand.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): \u2018m going to the supermarket to buy snacks for your trip. Do you want me to get those little boxes of Froot Loops you like?\nHoward: No! When I eat Froot Loops, the other astronauts make fun of me!\nBernadette: Howard, I don\u2019t want to wait until you\u2019re back to get married.\nHoward: What?\nBernadette: I want to be married to you before you get in that rocket.\nHoward: But I\u2019m leaving in two days.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): What about Apple Jacks?\nHoward: I don\u2019t need to take cereal.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): What kind of breakfast do you think they\u2019re going to give you in Russia?\nHoward: They invented blintzes. I\u2019ll be fine.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): They invented the lightbulb in New Jersey. It doesn\u2019t mean they hand them out to you when you go.\nBernadette: We\u2019ll have a quick little ceremony with just our friends, and we\u2019ll still have the big reception with everyone when you get back.\nHoward: Wow. Okay. Let\u2019s get married.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): You know what, I\u2019ll buy you All-Bran in case you get stopped up in outer space.\nScene: The apartment.\nBernadette: So anyway, we decided to go down to City Hall this afternoon get married, and then have the reception when Howard gets back.\nLeonard: That\u2019s so great. (Others also make encouraging sounds)\nHoward: I mean, we know it\u2019s short notice, but we\u2019d love you all to come with us.\nAmy: No, no, no, this is not the wedding I wanted! I want to wear my maid of honour dress and walk down the aisle with a hundred eyes on me, while a string quartet plays The Way You Look Tonight.\nBernadette: That wasn\u2019t going to be our processional music.\nAmy: Well, it was going to be mine.\nSheldon: Thank you for the invitation, but I have to decline because it doesn\u2019t sound like something I\u2019ll enjoy.\nLeonard: Come on, Sheldon, it\u2019ll be fun.\nSheldon: That\u2019s what you said about The Green Lantern movie. You were 114 minutes of wrong.\nBernadette: So, what do you say, Amy?\nAmy: Can I wear my maid of honour dress?\nBernadette: Seriously? You\u2019re going to wear that thing to City Hall?\nAmy: It\u2019s all I have left. You\u2019re going to take that from me, too?\nScene: City Hall.\nPenny: Amy, you look great.\nAmy: I know.\nLeonard: Where\u2019d you get a beer?\nRaj: From that happy young couple over there with all the tattoos. Beautiful story, they\u2019re in rival drug gangs, and they\u2019re getting married. Shh, no one can know.\nAmy: Look at all these people in love. It kind of gets you thinking, doesn\u2019t it?\nSheldon: It does, indeed. Leonard, is it awkward being here with Penny given that you recently proposed to her?\nHoward: You proposed to Penny?\nLeonard: I don\u2019t want to talk about it.\nRaj: Where did he pop the question? What did you say?\nLeonard: She said no, can we drop it now?\nPenny: It wasn\u2019t a real proposal.\nBernadette: Why wasn\u2019t it a real proposal?\nSheldon: He asked her during coitus.\nHoward: Did you get down on one knee or were you already there?\nBernadette: Howard, don\u2019t talk like that on your wedding day.\nHoward: I\u2019m sorry, Ma\u2026 Bernadette. Ma\u2026 Burna\u2026 You\u2019re ma Bernadette.\nPenny: Good move telling Sheldon.\nLeonard: What, I can\u2019t propose? I can\u2019t talk to my friends? Is there anything else I\u2019m not allowed to do?\nAmy: All right, that\u2019s enough. Today is not about you two. Today is about Howard and Bernadette and me.\nRegistrar: Folks, can I have your attention. It\u2019s five o\u2019clock, we\u2019re going to be able to take three more couples. The rest of you will have to come back on Monday.\nBernadette: Oh, no.\nHoward: I got this. Excuse me, but is there any way you could squeeze us in? See, I\u2019m an astronaut and I\u2019m leaving for Russia on Sunday so I can take a Soyuz rocket to the International Space Station.\nRegistrar: Yeah, me, too. I\u2019ll see you there.\nBernadette: I can\u2019t believe we\u2019re not going to get married.\nAmy: Excuse me, I\u2019m going to go see if the couple at the front of the line needs a maid of honour.\nScene: Soyuz capsule.\nCosmonaut: So, I tell my wife, get a dog, don\u2019t get a dog, I\u2019m not walking it, I\u2019m not feeding it, I\u2019m not picking up after it.\nMike: You know you\u2019re going to wind up walking it.\nCosmonaut: I know.\nHoward: Uh, shouldn\u2019t you guys be talking about space stuff instead of dogs?\nMike: Dimitri, Froot Loops would be more comfortable if we talked about space stuff.\nDimitri: Okay, I\u2019m going into space, and when I come back, I have to pick up a poodle crap.\nMike: Is that better?\nHoward: Thanks.\nScene: The Cheesecake Factory bar.\nHoward: You know, we could always drive to Vegas and get married.\nBernadette: No, isn\u2019t that kind of tacky?\nPenny: Hey, I know tons of people who got married in Vegas.\nBernadette: Are any of them still married?\nPenny: Yeah, I mean, not to the same people but\u2026\nBernadette: There\u2019s got to be some place special we could do it.\nSheldon: Leonard, where did you envision marrying Penny?\nLeonard: Will you shut up?\nRaj: Well, I know how to make it special.\nHoward: I told you we are not recreating the wedding from The Sound of Music.\nRaj: Yes, you made that brutally clear to me. What I was going to suggest is if that you\u2019re willing to wait until Sunday morning, the Google satellite will be over Pasadena. You can have a wedding photograph from space.\nAll: Oh!\nLeonard: That\u2019s so cool.\nHoward: Oh, wait to go, Raj.\nRaj: I keep telling you, if I wasn\u2019t an astrophysicist, I would have been a party planner. It was always a coin flip.\nHoward: Okay, so we know we\u2019re going to do it Sunday morning. Now we need to find a good place for the satellite to see us.\nLeonard: How about our roof?\nBernadette: Oh, I like that.\nHoward: That\u2019s great.\nAmy: Oh, my gosh. I can\u2019t believe my maid of honour dress is going to be on Google Earth.\nHoward: So, we have the where and the when, but we still need to figure out who\u2019s going to do the ceremony.\nPenny: Well, that\u2019s easy. Anyone can go online and get ordained as a minister. I know a piercing parlour where, for a hundred bucks they\u2019ll marry you and stick a wedding ring through any body part you want.\nBernadette: Great, well, who\u2019s it going to be?\nSheldon: I\u2019ll do it, provided I can perform the ceremony in Klingon.\nBernadette: No.\nSheldon: What do you see in her?\nScene: Soyuz capsule.\nDimitri (in Russian): Mission Control, say again, how fast is it leaking?\nHoward: Leaking? What\u2019s leaking?\nDimitri: Fuel. Shh.\nMission Control (in Russian): Not bad. We feel okay to go.\nDimitri (in Russian): Okay, thanks Mission Control.\nHoward: There\u2019s fuel leaking and we\u2019re still going to go?\nMike: Don\u2019t lose your Froot Loops, Froot Loops.\nDimitri: This happens a lot. Nine times out of ten, no problem.\nHoward: What happens on the tenth time?\nDimitri: Problem.\nScene: The apartment.\nHoward: Hey, guys, before I forget, I got you a little groomsman present.\nRaj: Oh, thanks, man.\nSheldon: You didn\u2019t have to do that.\nHoward: Fantastic Four, annual number three from 1965, in mint condition. The one where Mr. Fantastic and the Invisible Girl get married.\nLeonard: Oh, wow.\nSheldon: Oh, dear. I was afraid of this.\nHoward: What?\nSheldon: While a thoughtful gift, this comic book in this condition is worth at least a hundred dollars.\nHoward: Yeah, so?\nSheldon: I bought you and Bernadette a gravy boat worth eighty-eight dollars. Which places me in your debt and I can\u2019t be in your debt because someday you might ask me to help you move, or to kill a man.\nLeonard: I doubt he\u2019ll ask you to kill a man.\nSheldon: Well, what if it\u2019s his only way out? I can\u2019t risk it. Here is twelve dollars. Now, we\u2019re even. Wait, wait, wait, I bought a card. Give me two dollars. And for the record, this is why I hate gift-giving.\nScene: Penny\u2019s door. Howard knocks.\nAmy: Who is it?\nHoward: It\u2019s the groom.\nAmy: Can\u2019t come in. Bad luck to see the bride.\nHoward: Okay, uh, fine. Bernie, I have to go pick up my mother. I\u2019ll be right back.\nBernadette (off): Why can\u2019t she drive herself?\nHoward: She doesn\u2019t want to sit in her dress and wrinkle it so I\u2019m going to lay her down in the back of my neighbour\u2019s van.\nBernadette (off): All right, just hurry!\nHoward: Okay, I\u2019ll see you later, Ma\u2026 uh\u2026 lovely bride-to-be. I really got to watch that.\nScene: The roof.\nLeonard: Come on, Raj, we\u2019re ready to start.\nRaj: What, we\u2019re ready when I say we\u2019re ready. Uh-du-du-du, ooh, okay, now we\u2019re ready.\nHoward: Ma, you want to move your chair over here so you can see?\nMrs Wolowitz (off): I\u2019m fine where I am. I don\u2019t want to fall off the roof.\nHoward: You\u2019ll fall through the roof before you fall off it.\nRaj: Penny. (She starts music playing) \nMr Rostenkowski: Your new mother-in-law\u2019s a piece of work.\nBernadette: Not now, Dad.\nMr Rostenkowski: She\u2019s got a bigger mustache than me. Here you go.\nBernadette: Here you go? What am I, a football?\nMr Rostenkowski: Like that guy could catch a football.\nRaj: Howard and Bernadette, the five of us stand before you as your friends and newly ordained ministers.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Louder!\nBernadette: They all got ordained, they\u2019re all marrying us, it\u2019s adorable, if you want to hear come closer.\nRaj: Guys, when I look at the two of you starting your lives together, it fills my heart, It fills my, heart, okay, I\u2019m going to need a minute.\nPenny: Okay, I\u2019ll, I\u2019ll go. Howard and Bernadette, I know you two planned on getting married in a big fancy wedding, but when you\u2019re in love, it doesn\u2019t matter where or how these things happen. It just matters that you have each other.\nLeonard: Hmm.\nPenny: Problem?\nLeonard: No.\nSheldon: I think the Reverend Hofstadter is making an ironic connection between your statement about love and your rejection of his proposal in the bedroom.\nPenny: Oh, grow up.\nLeonard: Hey, I didn\u2019t say it.\nAmy: All right, that\u2019s enough from the both of you.\nPenny: Well, he started it.\nAmy: Well, I\u2019m ending it. Bernadette, I want to thank you for allowing me to be your maid of honour. I also want you to know, that I will be happy to do it again if this marriage craps out.\nLeonard: Thank you, Amy. Very touching. Howard and Bernadette, you are lucky enough to be best friends who love each other. And that\u2019s the strongest kind of love because at its core, it has kindness, patience, and respect. Qualities that are hard to find in people these days.\nSheldon: Would you like some aloe vera? You just got burned. All right, my turn. Howard, Bernadette. Daq tu\u2019 taH Daq yIn tlhej ghajtaH.\n\nBernadette: Sheldon! I told you no Klingon.\nSheldon: Fine, I\u2019ll do it in English, but it loses something. The need to find another human being to share one\u2019s life with has always puzzled me. Maybe because I\u2019m so interesting all by myself. With that being said, may you find as much happiness with each other as I find on my own. The Klingon would have made you cry.\nRaj: I believe you two have prepared vows?\nBernadette: Howard Joel Wolowitz, like you, this is going to be short and sweet. I love you with all my heart and soul and promise to be with you forever.\nHoward: Bernadette Maryann Rostenkowski.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Speak up!\nHoward: Hey, from now on, she\u2019s the only women who can yell at me! Until I met you, I couldn\u2019t imagine spending my life with just one person. And now I can\u2019t imagine spending one day of it without you.\nAll: By the power vested in us, by the state of California\u2026\nSheldon: And the Klingon High Council\u2026\nAll: We now pronounce you husband and wife.\nScene: Soyuz capsule.\nMike: That\u2019s ignition. I love this part.\nDimitri: Me, too.\nHoward: I have strongly mixed feelings.\nScene: The apartment.\nBernadette: Oh, my God, it\u2019s happening.\nPenny: Did I miss it?\nLeonard: No, come on in. Hurry.\nBernadette: I love that man.\nRaj: Me, too.\nPenny: I can\u2019t believe it. This whole time, a small part of me thought he was lying.\nLeonard: This is it.\nSheldon: Boldly go, Howard Wolowitz.\n(Russian countdown ends, rocket takes off)\nHoward (voice off): Oy vay!\nTeleplay: Chuck Lorre, Steven Molaro & Jim Reynolds\nStory: Bill Prady, Eric Kaplan & Steve Holland\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "8_23": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The apartment.\nPenny: Leonard, what time does your mom\u2019s plane get in?\nLeonard: I don\u2019t know, some time tomorrow morning.\nPenny: Don\u2019t you want to know for sure?\nLeonard: No need to. As soon as she flies into California airspace, I\u2019ll feel a disturbance in the Force.\nAmy: It\u2019s so nice both of your moms are coming in to see you guys get an award.\nSheldon: Well, my mother\u2019s been there for every honour I\u2019ve won since I beat out my twin sister for the did it on the potty trophy. How does this look?\nPenny: Aw, it\u2019s so nice. She\u2019s gonna love it.\nAmy: Sure, his mom gets roses. When I want them, they\u2019re a bouquet of severed plant genitals.\nSheldon: You act like I didn\u2019t get you that mushroom log on Valentine\u2019s Day.\nAmy: He\u2019s right. Roses die, but a moist rotting log will pump out mushrooms for two or three magical years.\nPenny: You know, your mom\u2019s never been too thrilled with our relationship. Maybe I should get her something so she warms up to me.\nLeonard: If you could run out and get a PhD, that might make her like you.\nPenny: Really? It didn\u2019t work for you.\nAmy: Do you think the moms will get along?\nLeonard: Uh, I don\u2019t know. They\u2019re pretty different.\nSheldon: Maybe they\u2019ll be best friends. One of them is brilliant, one is sweet and simple. Sound familiar?\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The apartment.\nMrs Cooper: Shelly, I\u2019m so proud of you and Leonard for getting this award.\nSheldon: Oh, thank you, Mother.\nMrs Cooper: I tried to read your paper, but it was very hard for me to understand.\nSheldon: Oh, it\u2019s quite straightforward, actually. It describes a new model of the universe that conceptualizes it as the surface of an n-dimensional superfluid.\nMrs Cooper: Interesting. You can believe that, but God filling an ark with animals two-by-two is nonsense.\nSheldon: What did they feed the lions, Mother?\nMrs Cooper: The floating bodies of drowned sinners, of course.\nSheldon: Listen, Leonard\u2019s mom is a renowned psychiatrist and woman of science. Can you please keep the Bible babble to yourself while she\u2019s here?\nMrs Cooper: Are you ashamed of me?\nSheldon: Of course not. I love you. I\u2019m just embarrassed by the things you believe, do and say.\nMrs Cooper: Well, I love you, too. My little bowl of lion chow.\nScene: The stairwell.\nDr Hofstadter: So, have you and Penny set a wedding date?\nLeonard: No, we\u2019re kind of taking it slow.\nDr Hofstadter: I see.\nLeonard: What does that mean?\nDr Hofstadter: You\u2019ve been on and off with this woman for seven years and engaged for one year. One has to wonder if there\u2019s a problem. Are you having satisfactory intercourse?\nLeonard: Yes, Mother.\nDr Hofstadter: Only satisfactory. I see.\nLeonard: I change my answer. It, it\u2019s amazing. It\u2019s hot. We can barely keep our hands off each other.\nDr Hofstadter: Seems odd to try and impress your mother with your sexual prowess. But then, you always did have that unresolved Oedipal complex.\nLeonard: See, this right here, what you\u2019re doing, can you please not do that around Sheldon\u2019s mom?\nDr Hofstadter: Why? Are you attracted to her, too?\nLeonard: Of course not. She\u2019s, she\u2019s just a very sweet and God-fearing lady, and you have to be respectful of her beliefs.\nDr Hofstadter: Leonard, I\u2019m an adult. I know how to conduct myself around people from different walks of life.\nLeonard: Thank you.\nDr Hofstadter: Where is she from again?\nLeonard: East Texas.\nDr Hofstadter: Ugh.\nLeonard: Hey, look who\u2019s here.\nSheldon: Oh, Doctor Hofstadter, it\u2019s so good to see you again.\nDr Hofstadter: Likewise. I read your paper, it was very impressive.\nSheldon: Oh, thank you.\nLeonard: We just spent two hours in traffic. Did you think to mention to me that you liked our paper?\nDr Hofstadter: Of course I did, but it\u2019s a mother\u2019s job to make sure her child\u2019s self-esteem is not dependent on anyone\u2019s approval.\nLeonard: That\u2019s so sweet, you think I have self-esteem.\nSheldon: Doctor Hofstadter, I want you to meet my mother, Mary.\nDr Hofstadter: : So nice to meet you.\nMrs Cooper: Nice to meet you, too. How was your flight?\nDr Hofstadter: Very pleasant. And yours?\nMrs Cooper: Lovely. Almost as if someone, not saying who, was watching over the plane.\nDr Hofstadter: You\u2019re kidding, right?\nLeonard: Subtle, mom, real subtle.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s house.\nBernadette: Stuart.\nStuart: Morning.\nBernadette: We talked about this. I don\u2019t mind you still living here, but we got to have some rules. And rule number one is pants.\nHoward: Hey.\nScene: The apartment. \nMrs Cooper: You must be very proud of your son.\nDr Hofstadter: Oh, yes. He recently argued a case before the Supreme Court.\nMrs Cooper: He did?\nDr Hofstadter: Oh, you mean this son. Uh, sure, he\u2019s terrific.\nSheldon: Beverly, would you like to see the math I worked out to support our hypothesis?\nLeonard: You mean, my hypothesis. I hypothesized it all by myself.\nDr Hofstadter: Calm down, dear. Mary, I\u2019m curious. When did you first realize that your son had such a remarkable mind?\nSheldon: Ooh, good question. Everyone loves stories about Sheldon Cooper, boy genius.\nMrs Cooper: Well, I would have to say when he was 13 and tried to build a nuclear reactor in the tool shed.\nSheldon: Ooh, this is a good one.\nMrs Cooper: Now, the first thing you have to know about Shelly is ever since he was a little boy, he was always concerned with the well-being of others. And he didn\u2019t think that it was fair for people to pay for electricity, so he was gonna power the entire town for free.\nSheldon: Tell her about the uranium. Tell her about the uranium.\nMrs Cooper: Oh, well. Oh, this is adorable. When he arranged to get some yellowcake from Chad, I thought he was talking about Twinkies from one of his friends.\nSheldon: But I wasn\u2019t. \u2018Cause I didn\u2019t have any friends.\nMrs Cooper: No. It turns out that this little scallywag was trying to use my Visa card to buy uranium from an African warlord in the country of Chad.\nDr Hofstadter: Sounds like Sheldon was a handful.\nMrs Cooper: Oh, he was a handful.\nSheldon: I was a handful.\nLeonard: You still are. Uh, Mom, hey, tell Mary the story about how I made a Van der Graaf generator out of our vacuum cleaner.\nDr Hofstadter: All right. He broke the vacuum cleaner.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s house.\nHoward: I mean, for a while, everything was vampires. Now it\u2019s all zombies. I wonder what the next monster fad will be.\nRaj: We haven\u2019t had a good invisible man in a while.\nStuart: Clearly, you\u2019ve never seen me try to talk to a woman.\nBernadette: Guys. In the time you\u2019ve been sitting here playing video games, I got the car washed, picked up cleaning supplies and went to the bank.\nStuart: I put on pants.\nHoward: Kiss-ass.\nBernadette: Okay, I don\u2019t know when I became the mother to three lazy teenagers, but it stops today. You guys are cleaning the kitchen, top to bottom.\nRaj: Hey, I don\u2019t even live here.\nBernadette: Yes or no, do you have clothes in my laundry right now?\nRaj: I do. And some of it\u2019s wool, so dry flat if possible.\nScene: The apartment. \nSheldon: Oh, and here\u2019s a picture of me receiving my bachelor of science degree.\nDr Hofstadter: You don\u2019t look very happy.\nSheldon: Well, I had just begun puberty. It was figuratively and literally one of the hairiest moments of my life.\nMrs Cooper: Shelly does not like change.\nSheldon: Oh, true. But all the clenching in the world will not keep testicles in your abdomen.\nPenny: Hey, sorry, got caught up at work. Hi, Beverly.\nDr Hofstadter: Hello. Oh, okay.\nPenny: Sorry, I forgot.\nSheldon: You remember my mother.\nPenny: Oh, yes. Hi, Mary.\nMrs Cooper: Good to see you again, dear.\nPenny: Ah, yeah, now that\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about.\nLeonard: So, Mom, you haven\u2019t seen Penny since we got engaged.\nPenny: Oh, yeah, let me show you the ring.\nDr Hofstadter: Oh, lovely. Must have been very expensive.\nSheldon: Oh, no, not at all. No, we, uh, found a place online that, uh, repurposes diamond drill bits.\nLeonard: We did not. That\u2019s not true. Can I speak to you alone for a second?\nSheldon: Oh, sure.\nLeonard: It came from Tiffany\u2019s.\nSheldon: You mean the box, right?\nLeonard: Keep walking.\nPenny: Really doesn\u2019t matter to me how much he spent on the ring. I think.\nSheldon: Did I misspeak about the ring?\nLeonard: Yes, and we\u2019ll get back to that. But, uh, even with your mother here, you are deliberately hogging all the attention from my mom. You\u2019re like one of those elephant seal pups that steals the milk from two mothers.\nSheldon: Do you mean what marine biologists refer to as super weaning?\nLeonard: Yes, you are a super weaner.\nSheldon: Well, now I have to correct you. As a bit of an elephant seal buff, the more accurate comparison would be when two mother seals actively seek to nourish the same pup. So I believe the term you\u2019re looking for is a double mother suckler.\nLeonard: Yeah, you\u2019re right. That is the term I\u2019m looking for. You are a dirty double mother suckler.\nSheldon: Okay, well, now that we have the terminology straightened out. How dare you.\nPenny: We\u2019re not in a rush. We\u2019ll set a date when the time is right.\nMrs Cooper: It doesn\u2019t matter, sweetie. The moment a man lays with a woman, they are married in the eyes of the Lord.\nDr Hofstadter: Uch.\nMrs Cooper: Uch? The bible is uch to you?\nDr Hofstadter: No, I\u2019m sorry. That was inappropriate. As a psychiatrist, I know how important people\u2019s superstitions can be to them.\nMrs Cooper: You want to talk about superstitions? Sheldon sent me the books you wrote, all that nonsense about superegos and ids. What bull dropped that on the barn floor?\nDr Hofstadter: His name is Sigmund Freud.\nPenny: Hey, look at that. You both believe in Jewish bearded guys.\nMrs Cooper: Stay out of this.\nPenny: Mm-hmm.\nMrs Cooper: At least the bearded man that I believe in preaches love and compassion. All yours talks about is why you hold in your poop and want to crawl back inside your mama.\nDr Hofstadter: It\u2019s fascinating. How can someone as enlightened as Sheldon come from someone like you?\nMrs Cooper: I know the answer. You\u2019re not gonna like it.\nDr Hofstadter: Try me.\nMrs Cooper: When I was pregnant with Shelly, I was driving to church, and I was praying to the Lord to give me a son smarter than his dumb-ass daddy. And I looked over and I saw a Jesus bobblehead in the Subaru next to me nodding yes. What is that supposed to mean?\nDr Hofstadter: : It means, I can\u2019t believe we\u2019re having this conversation.\nMrs Cooper: Well, do it some more. Maybe you can knock some sense into yourself.\nPenny: Why don\u2019t we all stop hitting ourselves and talk about something safe, you know, like shoes or how cute little Chinese babies are.\nSheldon: It is not my fault that your mother likes me better than she likes you.\nLeonard: Oh, don\u2019t flatter yourself. She likes everybody better than she likes me.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s house. \nRaj: How old is this Jell-O?\nStuart: Well, it\u2019s carrots, so gonna say very.\nHoward: Sorry we have to do this.\nStuart: Bernadette\u2019s not wrong. She does work hard around here.\nRaj: Yeah, maybe it\u2019s a good thing if she stops babying you so much.\nHoward: She doesn\u2019t baby me.\nStuart: I saw her pull you home in a wagon.\nHoward: For your information, I twisted my ankle chasing the ice cream truck.\nRaj: Face it, dude, Bernadette treats you the same way your mother used to, and that was not a healthy relationship.\nHoward: You\u2019re right. It\u2019s time for me to act like an adult in this marriage. Starting with my husbandly duty of taking out the trash. Bernie, I made a mess.\nScene: A coffee shop.\nDr Hofstadter: I\u2019m terribly sorry that I upset your mother.\nSheldon: Oh, it\u2019s all right. She\u2019ll forgive you. She has to or she goes to hell.\nDr Hofstadter: I can\u2019t help but notice how her unconditional love for you is diametrically opposed to my own parenting strategies.\nSheldon: Well, you doled out affection as a reward for achievement, a proven way to raise a child. Or train a rat.\nDr Hofstadter: But look how well you turned out.\nSheldon: I\u2019d feign modesty at this point, but who would believe me? Still, you need to consider how successful Leonard\u2019s brother and sister are.\nDr Hofstadter: I suppose.\nSheldon: While my brother and sister are mouth-breathing idiots.\nDr Hofstadter: Do you suppose you would\u2019ve flourished more in a reward-based environment?\nSheldon: Perhaps. But my mom made me spaghetti with chopped-up hot dogs whenever I wanted, so who cares?\nScene: The apartment. \nLeonard: Not once did my mother ever give me any love or affection for just being myself, I always had to earn it.\nMrs Cooper: Oh, Leonard, I\u2019m sure she loves you very much. In her own cold godless way.\nPenny: Yeah, and you certainly don\u2019t have to earn my love.\nLeonard: Thank you.\nPenny: Of course, you already knew that when you bought me this princess-cut drill bit.\nLeonard: That\u2019s not what it is.\nPenny: I know, I know. Zzzzzzzz.\nMrs Cooper: When your mom gets back, I\u2019m gonna need to apologize for the way I spoke to her.\nPenny: Well, come on now, she did kind of start it.\nMrs Cooper: Doesn\u2019t matter, a good Christian would\u2019ve turned the other cheek. On the other hand, a good Texan would\u2019ve shot her, so, I just kind of split the difference. Hey, who\u2019s in the mood for spaghetti and hot dogs?\nLeonard: Oh, me.\nPenny: Yeah, me, too.\nMrs Cooper: Coming up.\nLeonard: I don\u2019t really feel I deserve it.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s house.\nHoward: That was a big sticky mess, but I think I got it.\nRaj: Looks good.\nStuart: Yeah.\nBernadette: Look at that. You cleaned it up all by yourself.\nHoward: Yes, I cleaned it up all by myself. Honestly, I don\u2019t know why you complain so\u2026 okay, maybe I missed one spot. Just leave.\nScene: The apartment.\nMrs Cooper: I\u2019m so glad that you and I were able to bury the hatchet.\nDr Hofstadter: Me, too. And I respect your right to your beliefs.\nMrs Cooper: And I will pray for you.\nLeonard: Okay, Mom, let\u2019s get you back to your hotel before anyone says anything else.\nDr Hofstadter: One moment. There\u2019s something I need to say to you.\nLeonard: Oh, really? That\u2019s too bad.\nDr Hofstadter: Leonard, I always made you earn my affection, but today I realize that there\u2019s more than one way to raise a child.\nSheldon: I taught her that.\nDr Hofstadter: Therefore, I would like to initiate a new protocol wherein I shower you with unconditional love.\nLeonard: Wow. When does that start?\nDr Hofstadter: So needy. Come to Mommy.\nPenny: It\u2019s okay, go ahead.\nDr Hofstadter: Oh, my son.\nLeonard: Oh, my mother.\nPenny: Oh, my God.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s house. \nStuart (singing): It\u2019s a hard-knock life.\nTogether (singing): It\u2019s the hard-knock life for us, it\u2019s the hard-knock life for us. \u2018Stead of treated, we get tricked, \u2018stead of kisses, we get kicked, it\u2019s the hard-knock life. Got no folks to speak of so it\u2019s the hard-knock row we hoe, cotton blankets \u2018stead of wool, empty bellies \u2018stead of full, it\u2019s a hard-knock life.\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "9_18": "\n\t\t\t\tFollowing a \u201cpreviously on\u201d sequence.\nScene: Outside the University legal office.\nHoward: Okay, I gotta ask, why are you wearing a bow tie?\nSheldon: I\u2019ve never applied for a patent before. I wanted to make a good impression.\nHoward: Is the impression that your first name is Pee-Wee?\nSheldon: Yeah, well, you\u2019re an engineer. End of joke, burn.\nAttorney: Come on in, fellas.\nHoward: See, he\u2019s not wearing a tie.\nLeonard: Well, he\u2019s a patent attorney. Maybe his tie is pending.\nAttorney: So, I\u2019ve reviewed your paperwork, and it seems like we\u2019ve got everything we need to file a patent for your infinite persistence gyroscope.\nSheldon: That\u2019s great.\nHoward: Excellent.\nLeonard: So what happens next?\nAttorney: Well, the legal team needs to review existing patents to avoid overlap.\nHoward: Oh, I don\u2019t think there will be.\nLeonard: Yeah, we did our own search.\nAttorney: That\u2019s nice, but I think ours might be a bit more thorough.\nSheldon: Get a load of this guy.\nHoward: Can you imagine if we make money with this?\nLeonard: If we do, I am splurging on the best sinus irrigator money can buy.\nHoward: That old sad story, guy gets a little money, goes straight up his nose.\nAttorney: Just need you to review and sign this document acknowledging that you understand the university will own 75% of the patent.\nHoward: Seventy-five percent?\nSheldon: That\u2019s outrageous. This is our idea based on our research. How can you possibly justify owning a majority share?\nAttorney: It\u2019s university policy.\nSheldon: I know when I\u2019m beat.\nLeonard: Hold on, hold on. So the three of us do all the work and only end up with 25%?\nAttorney: Dr. Hofstadter, this university has been paying your salaries for over ten years. Did you think we do that out of the goodness of our hearts?\nLeonard: Well, until you just said that mean thing, kinda.\nAttorney: And as far as Mr. Wolowitz is concerned, I\u2019m afraid as a federal employee on loan from NASA, your name can be on the patent, but you\u2019re not entitled to an ownership share.\nHoward: Wait, so this can turn out to be a financial success, and I get nothing?\nAttorney: Well, sometimes they give you a plaque.\nSheldon: Well, that\u2019s not fair. We should all get plaques.\nLeonard: Sorry, but we can\u2019t sign this.\nHoward: Come on, let\u2019s go.\nLeonard: Thank you for your time.\nSheldon: Couple of questions about the plaque.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment.\nAmy: So, have you been having any morning sickness?\nBernadette: A little. And it doesn\u2019t help that I\u2019ve got this heightened sense of smell.\nPenny: Is that a pregnancy thing?\nBernadette: Yeah. The other day I sniffed out where Howie hid the Girl Scout cookies. No more Tagalongs, my ass.\nPenny: But now you\u2019ll be able to make your own milk to eat the cookies with.\nRaj: Hey, guys. Hey, Penny. I really appreciate you helping me with this. I don\u2019t know what to do.\nPenny: Oh, sure. Let me see it.\nAmy: See what?\nRaj: I hadn\u2019t spoken to Emily since I broke up with her, and she left this on my doorstep with a note.\nPenny: Raj, I got you this before we split up, but couldn\u2019t return it and thought you\u2019d like to have it. Happy belated Valentine\u2019s Day, Emily.\nBernadette: That\u2019s nice.\nPenny: Nice, or is she trying to manipulate him?\nRaj: I know. I mean, do I open it? Do I return it?\nAmy: Why wouldn\u2019t you open it?\nRaj: Well, she was pretty mad. For all I know it\u2019s a voodoo doll of me with a fork stuck in my junk.\nBernadette: You don\u2019t think she\u2019d actually send you something gross or dangerous, do you?\nPenny: I know one way to find out. Sniff this.\nAmy: She\u2019s pregnant, she\u2019s not a bloodhound.\nBernadette: Although I am getting a little machine oil. I think it\u2019s metal.\nPenny: Come on, just open it.\nRaj: You know, on Game of Thrones, Balon Greyjoy received his son\u2019s genitals in a box.\nPenny: Well, never hurts to have a spare.\nBernadette: What is that?\nRaj: Wow. It\u2019s an antique sextant. Sailors used these to find their position by the stars.\nAmy: What a nice gift for an astrophysicist.\nRaj: I know, she\u2019s so thoughtful.\nPenny: See, she\u2019s trying to get you back. Now, that is exactly what I would\u2019ve gotten you if I had any idea what it is or what you do.\nRaj: You know, I have too much self-esteem to let this girl guilt me into getting back together with her.\nAmy: You don\u2019t need to be pregnant to smell that load of crap.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: Well, what if we go around the university and just get the patent ourselves?\nHoward: We can\u2019t. It says on their Web site, as long as we work there, they have a controlling ownership of anything we come up with.\nSheldon: Great, so they own my idea for a T-shirt that says Dumb as a Bag of Geologists.\nLeonard: Well, our choices are we do this with the university or we don\u2019t do it at all.\nHoward: Either way, I get nothing.\nLeonard: Or, if we ended up making money from this, Sheldon and I could split our shares with you.\nSheldon: To be clear, Leonard is referring to the gyroscope, not the T-shirt and mugs. Oh, now they own the mugs.\nHoward: I guess that is a way around this. You guys would be cool doing it like that?\nLeonard: Of course, we can split any profits three ways.\nSheldon: I\u2019m fine with that.\nHoward: Okay, great.\nSheldon: It sounds like a, uh, contract might be in order.\nLeonard: Sure, we could write something up.\nSheldon: But which one of us should be the party who\u2026\nHoward: You can do it, Sheldon.\nSheldon: So stipulated.\nLeonard: Once I found a stash of contracts under his bed. It was weird.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment.\nBernadette: I wonder how much she spent on this.\nAmy: Ooh, let\u2019s find out.\nRaj: It doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s the thought that counts.\nPenny: Yeah, yeah, and beauty\u2019s on the inside, size doesn\u2019t matter, how much she spend?\nRaj: Seriously, guys, I don\u2019t want to know.\nAmy: Oh, my.\nRaj: Oh, come on, you can\u2019t say oh my, and then not tell me.\nAmy: These things go for five hundred dollars and up.\nBernadette: Damn. All I got for Valentine\u2019s Day was a postcard saying my Vermont Teddy Bear was back-ordered.\nPenny: Okay, so, she drops off a five hundred dollar gift and she\u2019s not trying to get back together with you?\nRaj: Maybe you\u2019re right.\nBernadette: Or she\u2019s telling the truth and just being nice.\nRaj: Maybe you\u2019re right. Wow, I am easy to manipulate. (Phone rings) Oh, guys, it\u2019s Emily. What should I do?\nPenny: Okay, answer it. Just be strong. And if she starts to cry, don\u2019t make any promises. And most importantly, put it on speaker so we can hear.\nRaj: Hello?\nEmily (voice): Hey, it\u2019s Emily. Is this a good time?\nRaj: Yeah, yeah. Sure. What\u2019s up?\nEmily: Was it okay I left that gift? I\u2019m really hoping we can be friends.\nRaj: Maybe, maybe.\nEmily: Um, you think you\u2019d want to grab a cup of coffee? Hello?\nRaj: I\u2019m sorry, I seem to be taking an annoying amount of time deciding how I feel about this.\nEmily: I just, I miss hanging out with you. It\u2019s not like I lost a friend, it\u2019s like I lost my best friend. Is there any chance you\u2019d want to come over?\nRaj: I\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea.\nEmily: Okay. I\u2019m just, I\u2019m having a really hard time, but that\u2019s not your problem, that\u2019s mine. I, I won\u2019t bother you again, but please know that you\u2019ll always have a place in my heart. Bye, Raj. You\u2019re a good guy.\nRaj: Good-bye, Emily. That was rough, you guys.\nPenny: I know, but you did it. I\u2019m so proud of you.\nRaj: Well, anyway, I\u2019ll leave you to your girls\u2019 night.\nAmy: Are you sure you don\u2019t want to stay here with us?\nRaj: No, I kind of feel like being alone right now.\nBernadette: Well, if you change your mind, we\u2019ll be here.\nRaj: Thank you.\nPenny: Say hi to Emily for us.\nRaj: Will do.\nScene: The apartment.\nHoward: This contract looks good to me.\nSheldon: I\u2019ll say it looks good. It\u2019s in my proprietary font, Shelvetica.\nLeonard: I want to say something obnoxious, but it is easy on the eyes.\nBernadette: I\u2019m a little tired, Howie. You ready to go?\nHoward: Yeah, one sec. I just need to sign this contract.\nBernadette: What is it?\nHoward: Well, we ran into a problem about my share of the patent, so we\u2019re forming a partnership to split anything we make equally.\nPenny: Sheldon, did you draft the contract?\nSheldon: You bet I did.\nPenny: Ooh. You\u2019re gonna make out so hard tonight.\nBernadette: So, you\u2019re just gonna sign this without having a lawyer look at it?\nSheldon: Excuse me. I\u2019ve been drafting contracts since kindergarten. Didn\u2019t need a lawyer to get me out of finger painting. Don\u2019t need one now.\nBernadette: I know, but\u2026\nHoward: Bernie, the guys were nice enough to find a way to keep me from being cut out.\nBernadette: Well, I should hope so. The whole thing was your idea.\nAmy: Well, to be fair, Howard\u2019s idea was based on Sheldon\u2019s math.\nLeonard: Guys, everyone is involved in thios, okay? Howard\u2019s invention, Sheldon\u2019s math, my original theory that space-time was like a supercooled liquid. Which I\u2019m sure Penny would\u2019ve mentioned if she wasn\u2019t working on that hangnail right now.\nPenny: What?\nHoward: Honey, this is fine.\nBernadette: If you want to sign a contract that Sheldon whipped up, go ahead.\nHoward: Can I talk to you in the hall?\nBernadette: Sure.\nHoward: Excuse us.\nSheldon: Hey, Leonard.\nLeonard: What?\nSheldon: If she doesn\u2019t think that we should apply for this patent, she\u2019s being patently absurd.\nLeonard: Good one.\nSheldon: Okay, you got it. See, I was afraid it was a thinker.\nHoward: What are you doing?\nBernadette: I just want to make sure you\u2019ve thought this through.\nHoward: What\u2019s to think about? We have an invention and want to move forward.\nBernadette: Howie, you\u2019re about to form a legal partnership with Sheldon Cooper.\nHoward: All right, if you\u2019re gonna calmly make excellent points, then I don\u2019t know if I want to talk to you. Okay. I get it. And it\u2019s sweet that you\u2019re worried about me, but I can take care of myself.\nBernadette: I\u2019m not worried about you. I\u2019m worried about me. I don\u2019t want to go through this pregnancy listening to you complain about Sheldon driving you crazy more than you already do.\nHoward: Here we go with the ironclad logic again.\nBernadette: You\u2019ve tried to work with him before. It hasn\u2019t gone well. Why is this time gonna be any different?\nHoward: Is the foetus helping you? \u2018Cause that\u2019s cheating.\nScene: Raj\u2019s car.\nRaj (answering phone): Hello?\nClaire: Hey, Raj. It\u2019s Claire. How are you?\nRaj: Hi. I\u2019m good. Really good. Well, I don\u2019t know why I said really good. I\u2019m just regular good. I really just wanted to sound confident. And that really was a real really, not a fake really like the first really.\nClaire: Really?\nRaj: I don\u2019t know. I lost track and I missed my exit. So, uh, so what\u2019s up?\nClaire: Well, last time we talked, I had just gotten back together with my boyfriend, and I wanted to let you know that things didn\u2019t work out.\nRaj: Really? I\u2019m sorry. I swear I know other words.\nClaire: So if you were still interested.\nRaj: Yes. Indeed. Absolutely. Indubitably. I\u2019m not even sure what the last one means, but it\u2019s another word, and I know it. So, uh, when do you want to meet up?\nClaire: Uh, I\u2019m almost off work. What are you doing now?\nRaj: Right now, well, well, actually, to, to be completely honest, I\u2019m stopping by to see my ex-girlfriend because she\u2019s having a tough time. But it\u2019s not like we\u2019re getting back together or anything.\nClaire: Let me guess, the worst part about breaking up is that she doesn\u2019t have her best friend to talk to any more?\nRaj: That\u2019s exactly what she said. How do you know that?\nClaire: I\u2019m a girl. It\u2019s, like, page one out of the playbook.\nRaj: Any chance you could send me a PDF of that playbook?\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: They\u2019ve been out there a while.\nAmy: I hope everything\u2019s okay.\nSheldon: I wonder what they\u2019re talking about.\nPenny: If you guys would shut up, I could tell you. Oh. Be cool, be cool, be cool.\nHoward: Hey.\nSheldon: Hello.\nLeonard: You guys all right?\nHoward: Yeah. But, um, we were talking, and I\u2019m a little concerned about the three of us forming a partnership.\nSheldon: Are you suggesting a limited liability corporation? \u2018Cause I did not L-L-see that coming.\nHoward: Sheldon, my concern is not with the money or anything. It\u2019s, it\u2019s with how you treat me.\nSheldon: Well, I believe I\u2019m treating you generously. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve stipulated in the contract that your contributions to our invention are as valuable as my own.\nBernadette: Are you saying that his contributions aren\u2019t as valuable as yours?\nSheldon: No, I am not saying that, because I kept saying that this morning and Leonard said stop saying that.\nHoward: See? This is what happens every time we work together.\nPenny: You know what, hang on. What if Sheldon had no choice but to be respectful?\nLeonard: What? Is there a switch on the back of his neck we don\u2019t know about?\nPenny: No. What I\u2019m saying is you could add a clause to the contract that he can\u2019t make fun of Howard.\nBernadette: How would you enforce it?\nSheldon: Oh, please. Any contract I sign is enforced by my own personal code of ethics.\nAmy: And his obsessive-compulsive disorder.\nSheldon: Yeah, that, too. And scoot over. Part of your shadow\u2019s on my spot.\nLeonard: Howard, what do you think?\nHoward: I\u2019m on board.\nSheldon: I\u2019ll add it right now. Oh, baby, it\u2019s addendum time.\nScene: Raj\u2019s car.\nEmily (voice): Hello?\nRaj: Hey, Emily, listen, I\u2019ve been thinking, and I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s a good idea that I come over.\nEmily: Oh. Okay. I understand.\nRaj: No, no. Please don\u2019t cry.\nEmily: Okay, I\u2019ll stop.\nfade\nClaire: Hello?\nRaj: Hey, so, listen, Claire, change of plans\u2026\nClaire: Fine. Do what you want, but she\u2019s playing you.\nRaj: I don\u2019t think so. She sounded pretty upset.\nClaire: You mean like, I was just really looking forward to seeing you. I\u2019m having such a rough day.\nfade\nRaj: Emily, listen, I\u2019m sorry, but I can\u2019t come by.\nEmily: Why not?\nRaj: I think we both know if I come over, we\u2019re gonna get back together and\u2026\nEmily: I told you I needed a friend. What do you think is happening here?\nRaj: Call you right back.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: The, the revisions I made start on page four.\nPenny: Wow. That is a lot of whereupons.\nAmy: You should see the Valentine\u2019s Day card he gave me.\nHoward: Article three, as it pertains to this project, Dr. Sheldon Cooper promises to abstain from all insulting or disrespectful language directed toward Howard Wolowitz, including but not limited to mockery of engineering, his height, his hair, his wardrobe, and his insane belief that the Ghost Rider movie was, quote, not that bad.\nLeonard: Hang on. Maybe there should be a no insult clause about me, too.\nSheldon: Do you still like cilantro?\nLeonard: Yeah.\nSheldon: You\u2019re tying my hands here.\nHoward: All right, let\u2019s sign this.\nPenny: Wait, wait, wait. What are these changes on page six?\nAmy: Sheldon, what did you do?\nHoward: I should\u2019ve known.\nBernadette: 25% of profits due to Sheldon Cooper will be allocated to a scholarship fund for the firstborn child of Howard and Bernadette Wolowitz. Sheldon, that\u2019s so nice.\nLeonard: That beats the onesie I was gonna get them from baby Gap.\nHoward: That\u2019s very generous, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Oh, I\u2019ve always valued education over money. And the very fact that you needed a written guarantee of respect made me realize how dismissive I\u2019ve been of your contributions.\nHoward: I appreciate that.\nSheldon: And I just hope that this scholarship can rescue your child from the subpar education and menial life of an engineer.\nAmy: Sheldon.\nSheldon: What? I didn\u2019t sign it yet.\nScene: Raj\u2019s car.\nRaj: I hear what you\u2019re saying, but I\u2019ve known Emily a long time, and I think she deserves the benefit of the doubt.\nClaire: All right, it\u2019s your life. But you know how this is gonna end.\nRaj: As a matter of fact, I do. I\u2019m gonna comfort her, because I\u2019m a caring and decent friend who\u2019s happy to be there when she needs someone to talk to.\nScene: Emily\u2019s bed.\nRaj: Good talk.\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "3_17": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The stairwell. Leonard is carrying a large box.\nLeonard: Why do I always have to carry the heavy stuff?\nSheldon: Well, it\u2019s very simple. In our ragtag band of scientists with nothing to lose, I\u2019m the smart one, Wolowitz is the funny one, and Koothrappali is the lovable foreigner who struggles to understand our ways and fails. That leaves you, by default, as the muscle.\nLeonard: One more floor, and I\u2019d be the pulled muscle.\nPenny (who is inside the apartment): Oh, it\u2019s about time, I\u2019m starving.\nLeonard: Uh, well, we didn\u2019t actually get Chinese food.\nPenny: Why not?\nLeonard: Don\u2019t panic, this is better.\nPenny: Oh, no, you didn\u2019t trade the food for magic beans, did you?\nSheldon: Of course not. And, technically, magic beans would be food, although eating them would be quite a waste, since you could plant them and overnight have a giant beanstalk, which would provide enough roughage for a small city.\nPenny: Yeah, sometimes I don\u2019t listen, sometimes I just watch your jaw go up and down.\nLeonard: We were on our way to the Chinese restaurant when we thought we saw Adam West, so we followed him.\nPenny: Who\u2019s Adam West?\nSheldon: Who\u2019s Adam West? Leonard, what do the two of you talk about after the coitus?\nHoward: My guess is, \u201cHey, four minutes! New record!\u201d That\u2019s why I\u2019m the funny one.\nLeonard: Anyway, we followed the guy to this garage sale, and they had the coolest stuff.\nHoward: They were closing up. We got this whole box for sixty bucks.\nLeonard: We didn\u2019t even get to go through it all. There could be anything in here.\nPenny: There a new girlfriend in there? \u2018Cause you might need one.\nLeonard: No. But there is an original final draft Ghostbusters script with actual slime stains! (Raj whispers to Leonard) Oh, you\u2019re right, it\u2019s Ghostbusters 2. Never mind.\nHoward: Oh, my God. An Alf doll. When I was 11 my mother got me one to help me sleep after my dad left. I used to pretend that my dad had moved to the planet Melmac, and Alf was going to bring him back to me. But he never did. Where\u2019s my daddy, puppet? Where is he?\nPenny: That is so sad.\nSheldon: No, what\u2019s sad is that you don\u2019t know Adam West was TV\u2019s Batman.\nCredits sequence\n \nScene: The same\nLeonard: Here\u2019s Spock\u2019s head with no body. Here\u2019s Mr. T\u2019s body with no head. Oh, yeah, here\u2019s Spock\u2019s body with Mr. T\u2019s head. I pity the fool who\u2019s illogical.\nPenny: Okay, I\u2019m just gonna go home and make a grilled cheese and window-shop on eHarmony.\nLeonard: Okay, bye.\nPenny: Okay.\nLeonard: Ooh, look, an Indiana Jones connect-the-dots.\nRaj: And an Aquaman action figure.\nHoward: Looks like someone drew a penis on him.\nRaj: Huh? That\u2019ll come off.\nHoward: You see what you\u2019re doing? Stop that.\nSheldon: Fascinating.\nLeonard: What?\nSheldon: It appears to be a Lord of the Rings ring.\nLeonard: Oh.\nRaj: It\u2019s even got the Elvish engraving on it.\nSheldon: It\u2019s not Elvish. It\u2019s the language of Mordor written in Elvish script. One Ring to\nrule them all.\nRaj: One Ring to find them.\nHoward: One Ring to bring them all.\nLeonard: And in the darkness bind them.\nRaj: Holy crap, are we nerdy.\nScene: The Cheesecake Factory\nHoward: So, I was doing some checking on the ring.\nRaj: Hold on. Sheldon, is there ketchup on that table?\nSheldon: Yes, there is. Oh, here\u2019s a fun fact, ketchup started out as a general term for sauce, typically made of, uh, mushrooms or fish brine with herbs and spices. Some popular early main ingredients included blueberry, anchovy, oyster, kidney bean and grape.\nRaj: No, that\u2019s okay. I\u2019ll get it.\nHoward: Listen, I was looking at the ring, and it seemed a little weird. No copyright notice on it. So, I took it down to this buddy of mine who deals with, shall we say, the seedy underbelly of the collectibles world.\nLeonard: Seedy underbelly?\nHoward: You know, your black market phasers, your screen-worn Lieutenant Uhura panties, that kind of stuff.\nRaj: Who\u2019s this mysterious buddy you suddenly have?\nHoward: Just a guy. I know a guy.\nRaj: Is it Eddie Crispo?\nHoward: No, I can\u2019t tell you who it is. Stop asking.\nRaj: Who else could it be? It has to be Eddie Crispo.\nHoward: I know lots of dangerous people, okay?\nRaj: Name one.\nHoward: Eddie Crispo. Anyway, he said this isn\u2019t a replica. It\u2019s the real deal.\nSheldon: If you\u2019re suggesting that that is the actual ring of power forged by Sauron in Mount Doom, I look at you with an expression of exhaustion and ever so slight amusement.\nLeonard: He\u2019s not saying it\u2019s a magic ring. You\u2019re not, are you?\nHoward: No, but it\u2019s close. Look at the markings inside. Those are production markings. Nine rings were made for use in the Lord of the Rings movies. Three were given to members of the cast. The rest were destroyed. Except one. One was stolen. Gentlemen, this is the one ring.\nSheldon (snatching it): Mine!\nLeonard: No, it is not yours. We all went in on the box together.\nSheldon: Well, yes, but I found it in the box, and the laws of maritime salvage clearly state that the finder of a sunken treasure is the owner of the treasure.\nLeonard: How is this maritime salvage?\nSheldon: Other than the lack of water, how is it not?\nRaj: Wait, wait. Sheldon, stop being crazy for a second. How much is something like this worth?\nHoward: Well, it\u2019s tough to say since it\u2019s hot, but on the underground market, my guy figures\u2026\nRaj: Your guy Eddie Crispo?\nHoward: Yes. He figures ten, maybe 15 thousand.\nRaj: Okay, that\u2019s a lot of money. The wise thing to do is invest it in something practical. Like a jet ski.\nHoward: Why do you want a jet ski?\nRaj: All the wealthy and beautiful people in movies ride Jet Skis. That can\u2019t just be a coincidence.\nSheldon: We can\u2019t sell it. We have to keep it and love it and polish it, and only take it out occasionally when we go to the park and re-enact our favourite scenes from the movies.\nHoward: It\u2019s sad how great that sounds.\nLeonard: Guys, it\u2019s stolen. It should go back to Peter Jackson. He made the movies, it belongs to him.\nHoward: Fine. He can have it back as long as he promises to make me a hobbit in his next movie.\nRaj: There are no Jewish hobbits.\nHoward: Clearly, you\u2019ve never been to my house for dinner on Rosh Hashanah.\nLeonard: We are not blackmailing Peter J\u2026 All right, where\u2019s the ring?\nSheldon: You mean my ring?\nLeonard: What are you doing?\nSheldon: The ring was unguarded, it was just sitting on the table, anyone could have taken it. Proof? I did.\nLeonard: Give me that.\nRaj: Look, let\u2019s be reasonable. We all want to do different things with the ring, but your ideas are stupid, and I want a jet ski.\nSheldon: I found it. The ring is mine. I don\u2019t understand why in this group I never get my way.\nLeonard: You always get your way.\nSheldon: I\u2019ll stipulate to that if you give me the ring.\nPenny: Hey, guys. Enjoying your food that I actually brought you instead of promising food, but bringing you a box of random crap?\nLeonard: Yeah, it\u2019s delicious, the sarcasm\u2019s a little stale, though. Hey, how about this? Until we figure out what to do with the ring, Penny holds on to it.\nPenny: What ring?\nLeonard: This ring.\nSheldon: Looking for something?\nLeonard: Will you hold on to this for a couple of days?\nPenny: Why?\nLeonard: It\u2019s a prop from a movie, and we\u2019re kind of fighting over it.\nPenny: Okay, just to be clear, the first piece of jewellery my boyfriend gives me is a prop from a movie, and I don\u2019t even get to keep it?\nHoward: If you had gone out with me three years ago, by now, you\u2019d have my great Aunt Ida\u2019s brooch that she smuggled out of occupied Belgium in a cat.\nLeonard: How am I looking now?\nScene: Penny and Leonard are asleep in Leonard\u2019s bed. Sheldon creeps in and tries to take the ring from round Penny\u2019s neck, but she turns over. He tries to make buzzing fly noises to get her to turn back, but she turns all the way the other way. He then uses an extender with a claw on the end to lif the ring from Penny\u2019s chest. As he tries to remove it, she wakes up, screams, and punches him in the face.\nSheldon: Ow! You hit me! I\u2019m bleeding!\nLeonard: What was that?\nPenny: Sheldon tried to take the ring and I punched him.\nLeonard: That\u2019s my girl.\nScene: The cafeteria.\n \nHoward: So, Sheldon, how\u2019s it feel to get beaten up by a girl?\nSheldon:\u00a0 It\u2019s not the first time. I have a twin sister whose assaults began in utero. If only I\u2019d had the presence of mind to reabsorb her, then I\u2019d have a mole with hair in it instead of a tedious yearly Christmas letter.\nRaj: Gentlemen, have you come to the realization that the only reasonable course of action is to sell the ring and divide the money?\nLeonard: No.\nRaj: I was afraid of that. (Opens his laptop to reveal an Indian looking man on a webcam.) Go ahead.\nMan on Screen: Greetings from Mumbai. I am Raj\u2019s attorney, Venkatesh Koothrappali.\nRaj: Also my cousin.\nHoward: You brought a lawyer?\nVenkatesh: Don\u2019t answer that. I\u2019ll get straight to the point. My client\u2019s prepared to surrender any interest he has in the ring in exchange for two Kawasaki Jet Skis.\nLeonard: We\u2019re not giving him two Jet Skis.\nVenkatesh: Look, we\u2019re big boys, why don\u2019t we just cut to the chase and meet in the middle? One Kawasaki Jet Ski, done and done.\nLeonard: No Jet Skis.\nVenkatesh: All right, forget the Jet Skis.\nRaj: Forget the Jet Skis? That was our line in the sand! What happened to \u201ctear them a new one?\u201d\nVenkatesh: What can I say? They played hardball. We lost.\nRaj: You\u2019re useless.\nVenkatesh: I told you that when you hired me.\nRaj: I\u2019m signing off now.\nVenkatesh: Call your mother, she worries.\nHoward: Okay, just so you know, if we\u2019re bringing in cousins who are lawyers, prepare for shock and awe.\nLeonard: You know what? I am ending this. Penny didn\u2019t want to hold the ring anymore. She gave it to me, I have it. I\u2019m sending it back. Where\u2019s the ring?\nSheldon: You mean this ring? Next time be aware of your surroundings while urinating in a public men\u2019s room.\nLeonard: Give me that.\nSheldon: No, it\u2019s mine.\nRaj: It\u2019s all of ours. (They begin to struggle over the ring.)\nLeonard: Okay, now, this is ridiculous!\nHoward: Then let go!\nLeonard: I\u2019m not letting go, you let go.\nHoward: I say this ring belongs to the last person who can hold on.\nLeonard: Fine. But can\u2019t we go home and start this?\nRaj: Sure. Let go of the ring.\nLeonard: All right, it starts now.\nHoward: You do realize there\u2019s a giant bug movie marathon tonight on the Syfy Channel. (They start to move away from the table while all still holding the ring.)\nRaj: Wait, my laptop. (They go back for it.)\nScene: The stairwell. The guys are coming up the stairs, all still holding the ring.\n \nHoward: You know, there\u2019s a point when this becomes idiotic.\nLeonard: And it wasn\u2019t when we were driving like this?\nSheldon: I would advise the three of you that resistance is futile. I have endless patience. I once spent two-and-a-half hours on hold with Hewlett-Packard customer service just to complain about their customer service.\nLeonard: You want to talk about endless patience? Penny made me watch all five seasons of Sex and the City.\nRaj: There are six seasons, dude.\nLeonard: Oh, crap!\nRaj: No, no, no, the sixth season is great. We go to Paris with Carrie and get our heart broken, and then Mr. Big shows up, we don\u2019t know if we can trust him again. It\u2019s a wild ride.\nLeonard: Door. (Leonard tries to unlock the door and drops the keys.)\nRaj: Okay, everybody, and plie. And relevae.\nPenny: Whatcha doin\u2019?\nLeonard: Last one holding the ring decides its fate. I know, it sounds silly.\nPenny: No, no, no, no, no, no, you are my boyfriend. Nothing you do is silly to me.\nLeonard: Thank you.\nPenny: FYI, this is a bag from Victoria\u2019s Secret.\nLeonard: I\u2019m out.\nScene: The apartment. The three guys are still holding the ring. Howard is on the phone. \nHoward: I\u2019m sorry, Ma, I have to stay late at the office.\nRaj: No, he\u2019s doesn\u2019t! He\u2019s lying to you!\nHoward: Will you be quiet?\nRaj: Well, if you want privacy let go of the ring. I\u2019m so glad we came to this gentile strip club! Howard, here\u2019s more bacon to tuck into the shiksa\u2019s G-string!\nHoward: I\u2019ll call you back.\nRaj: I think it\u2019s lovely you call your mommy and let her know you\u2019re going to be late for dinner. From what I know about these things, if a woman doesn\u2019t breast-feed on time, it\u2019s very uncomfortable for her boobies.\nHoward: Don\u2019t you talk about my mother\u2019s boobies!\nRaj: If you\u2019re offended, let go of the ring and go on home to your mother\u2019s boobies.\nSheldon: Excellent, excellent. Tire each other out, the ring will be mine. Howard, why don\u2019t you go after Raj\u2019s mother?\nRaj: Why don\u2019t we go after your mother?\nSheldon: Go ahead. I have no illusions about my mother. She is a kind, loving, religiously fanatical right-wing Texan with a slightly out-of-scale head and a mild Dr. Pepper addiction. Anything you\u2019d like to add?\nHoward: That\u2019s not gonna Better pull out the big gun.\nRaj: You\u2019re right. Let\u2019s talk about your grandmother.\nSheldon: No! I call no Meemaws.\nRaj: Think about this. The only way your mother was born was your Meemaw had sex.\nSheldon: I don\u2019t want to hear this.\nHoward: Then let go of the ring and walk away.\nSheldon: Never.\nHoward: All right. I\u2019ll bet your Meemaw didn\u2019t just have sex to have your mother. I bet she had sex because she liked it.\nSheldon: Stop it!\nRaj: Yeah, Meemaw did the nasty.\nSheldon: I said stop it!\nHoward: We\u2019re getting to him.\nSheldon: Waterfalls!\nRaj: What?\nSheldon: Waterfalls. Crashing waves. Babbling brooks.\nHoward: What are you doing?\nSheldon: Subliminal messaging. I\u2019m going to make you want to pee. Dripping faucets. Leaky gutter. Peeing.\nRaj: It\u2019s, it\u2019s not working, dude.\nSheldon: Oh-ho-ho, it\u2019s working all right. I have to pee.\nRaj: Then let go of the ring and go.\nHoward: No, actually, I wouldn\u2019t mind going, too.\nRaj: Fine. Um, on the count of three. One, two\u2026\nSheldon: Wait, just to clarify. When you get to three, do we stand up or do we pee?\nHoward: We stand up.\nSheldon: Excellent choice.\nRaj: Three.\nHoward: Something tells me this was a bad day to wear suede shoes.\nScene: Sometime later. The guys are on the settee. Howard is seen asleep, he is not holding the ring. The camera pans along to where Sheldon and Raj still hold the ring. Raj, also asleep, lets go and cuddles up to Howard. \nSheldon: I\u2019ve done it! I\u2019ve won! The ring is mine! It\u2019s mine! (He runs to the bathroom) We\u2019re going to clean it up and make it pretty. My own. My love. My precious. (He looks in the mirror and has turned into golem. He screams and wakes up, still on the settee.) Where\u2019s the ring?\nLeonard: It\u2019s in a FedEx box on its way back to where it came from.\nRaj: The fires of Mount Doom?\nLeonard: Peter Jackson\u2019s office in New Zealand. It wasn\u2019t ours.\nHoward: You quit the game! You had no right to take it.\nLeonard: I came in here, you guys were all sleeping. The ring was on the floor. No one was touching it.\nRaj: Well, so then we start the game over until there\u2019s a winner.\nLeonard: There wasn\u2019t ever going to be a winner. There was going to be a selfish, petty person with a ring and three people who used to be his friend. Is that really what you guys want? \u2018Cause if it is, fine, I don\u2019t want anything to do with you. And I don\u2019t know what happened in that bathroom, but I am not cleaning it up! (Goes to his bedroom. Takes a box from under his bed. Takes out the ring.) My precious.\nScene: Leonard and Penny are asleep in Leonard\u2019s bed. The extender and claw reaches across and pulls down the sheet revealing the ring on a chain round Leonard\u2019s neck.\nSheldon: I knew it. Give us the precious!\nLeonard: NEVER!\n(They begin to struggle, both shouting \u201cgive it\u201d, \u201cgive it to me\u201d and \u201cit\u2019s mine\u201d at various intervals. Penny gets out of the bed and heads out the door.)\nPenny: Ugh, gotta go back to dating dumb guys from the gym.\n\ufeff\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "9_5": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: Howard\u2019s workshop.\nLeonard: Hey, ready for lunch?\nHoward: Oh, one sec.\nSheldon: Is that the prototype drive system for the high-G rover?\nHoward: No, Bernadette got me a Fitbit so she can track how much I\u2019m exercising.\nLeonard: That\u2019ll teach her to care about your health.\nHoward: Yeah, I can\u2019t wait to see the look on her face when I die young.\nRaj: When was the last actual exercise you got?\nHoward: The other day, when she tried to put that Fitbit on me and I ran away from her.\nSheldon: According to a recent study, simply thinking about exercise, even while sitting still, can have physical benefits. For all you know, I could be exercising right now.\nRaj: Are you?\nSheldon: Nah, I\u2019ll do it tomorrow.\nLeonard: It wouldn\u2019t be the worst thing if we were more active.\nHoward: You make an excellent point. Ooh, I think I\u2019m getting a runner\u2019s high.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: Look at all these activities the university has. Rock climbing club, archery, flag football.\nSheldon: Had me at flag, lost me at football.\nPenny: Yeah, I think it\u2019s great you guys want to get more exercise, but do you really think sports is the right choice for you?\nLeonard: What are you saying? We\u2019re not coordinated enough to play sports?\nPenny: Okay, Leonard, sweetheart, you twisted your ankle playing Scrabble.\nLeonard: I got a triple-word score with a double letter Q. If that\u2019s not a time to bust out the scrabble dance, what\u2019s the point of having one? Hey, Barry Kripke started a fencing club.\nSheldon: Interesting. Sword fighting does hold a certain elegant appeal. And I would imagine it meets many of our personal criteria for a sport.\nLeonard: It\u2019s indoors, so no sunscreen.\nSheldon: No throwing, no catching, no running.\nLeonard: No gym shorts that can be yanked down.\nSheldon: Or worse, up.\nLeonard: Preach.\nSheldon: And as an added bonus, the word touch\u00e9 comes from fencing. It would be our only opportunity to use it in a non-metaphorical sense.\nLeonard: What about a game of tag on a French schoolyard?\nSheldon: Ah, touch\u00e9.\nScene: The comic book store.\nStuart: Thanks for coming by.\nBernadette: Sure. So how can we help?\nStuart: Well, I know more women are buying comics than ever, but for some reason, I, I can\u2019t get \u2019em in here.\nPenny: All right, well, what have you tried so far?\nStuart: Uh, I\u2019ve, I\u2019ve been stocking more female-oriented titles. Uh, in the bathroom, I folded the end of the toilet paper into a triangle. And, uh, you are now sitting in the official breastfeeding area.\nPenny: Really? In a comic book store?\nStuart: Oh, don\u2019t worry. I, I\u2019ve got a camera right up here, so I could watch from the counter and make sure guys aren\u2019t being pervs. Anyway, so what do I got to do to, to get you in the door?\nAmy: Well, for starters, you might want to rethink some of this artwork. I mean, this woman\u2019s actually on a leash like a dog.\nStuart: Well, you don\u2019t know the backstory. Maybe she kept jumping up on the couch.\nScene: The gym.\nRaj: I feel cool. Like Puss in Boots.\nLeonard: I always wanted to be a swashbuckler when I was a kid.\nSheldon: Technically, swashbuckler is a combination of two terms. Swash referring to the sound of the sword. Swash. And then buckler meaning a small shield, which you don\u2019t have.\nRaj: We can still be swashers.\nHoward: Well said, Puss.\nBarry: Gentlemen, welcome to the fencing cwub. Before we start, I just want to warn you, fencing isn\u2019t a joke. I hope you\u2019re not here because you think it\u2019s going to be wike Star Wars.\nLeonard: That\u2019s not why we\u2019re here.\nRaj: Yeah, I\u2019m here because I think it\u2019s gonna be like Game of Thrones.\nHoward: And maybe a little Princess Bride.\nRaj: Ooh, ooh, I forgot about Princess Bride. That\u2019s my answer.\nBarry: Well, sowwy to disappoint you, but fencing is a sewious spowt. If you\u2019re not wiwwing to put in the effowt, you might as well just weave now.\nSheldon: We\u2019re not afraid of physical activity.\nHoward: Yeah. I already ran 18 miles today.\nBarry: Awwight. Let\u2019s begin with some fundamentals. This is the en garde position. Feet are in an L. Heels in a stwaight wine. Elbow is about a fist from the wib cage. Notice my dominant weg faces fowward.\nSheldon: Oh, dear.\nBarry: What\u2019s wong, Cooper?\nSheldon: Well, I\u2019m not sure I have a dominant leg. They\u2019re both pretty submissive.\nHoward: When you\u2019re in a public restroom, which foot do you flush the toilet with?\nSheldon: Right. Always right.\nHoward: He\u2019s a righty.\nBarry: Okay, show me en garde. Good. Knees bent, swightwy over the toe. Non-sword hand up for bawance.\nHoward: Oh, God, I am going to feel this tomorrow.\nBarry: The first move is called an advance. You move your fwont foot fowward, heel to toe. Back foot fowwows. So fwont foot fowward, heel to toe. Back foot fowwows. Now you twy. Advance. And advance. And advance.\nLeonard: This is easy. I didn\u2019t need to wear a cup.\nBarry: Good. The next move is called a wetweat. Step back. Back foot first, toe to heel. Fwont foot fowwows. On thwee.\nSheldon: Excuse me, Barry?\nBarry: Yes.\nSheldon: When can I stab one of my friends?\nBarry: In fencing, we don\u2019t call it a stab. We call it a touch.\nSheldon: Uh, yes, I\u2019m aware. But if I say I want to touch one of my friends, I\u2019ll get called into Human Resources.\nBarry: Okay, on thwee, Cooper and Koothwappawi advance, the other two wetweat. One, two, thwee. Vewy good. Switch it up. One, two, thwee. Switch again. One, two, thwee. (Phone rings) Excuse me. Can I call you back? No, I\u2019m teaching a cwass. Sure. Sure. An hour, tops. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Thanks. And one, two, thwee.\nScene: The comic book store.\nAmy: Have you thought about advertising directly to females?\nStuart: Hmm, okay. Well, alright, what if I put up a sign in the window that said women, come in. Don\u2019t be afraid.\nPenny: Hey, have you read the online reviews for this place?\nStuart: Eh, the Internet\u2019s so negative. I try to avoid it.\nPenny: All right, well, Heather H says, the owner stared at me the whole time and didn\u2019t blink once. Kelly M says, the creepy guy who runs it asked me out, then called himself stupid before I could say no. Jessica K says, I told the weird owner that I liked his shirt. He took it off and gave it to me.\nStuart: See? Negative.\nScene: The gym.\nBarry: With your foil extended, kick your fwont weg up and push off with your back weg. Now you twy. And again. And again.\nRaj: Look at us. We\u2019re like the Rockettes.\nSheldon: En garde, Leonard. Prepare yourself for a rigorous touching.\nHoward: My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.\nRaj: My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.\nHoward: I thought you were Puss in Boots.\nRaj: Oh, yeah, right. Sorry. My name is Puss in Boots. You killed my father. Prepare to die.\nSheldon: I\u2019m looking forward to him teaching us glove-slapping.\nLeonard: What?\nSheldon: You know, when my honour is insulted, and I need to challenge someone to a duel by slapping them across the face with my glove.\nLeonard: When was your honour insulted?\nSheldon: My last physical.\nLeonard: Again, that doctor didn\u2019t insult your honour. Just checked your prostate.\nRaj: My name is Little Orphan Annie. You killed my father. Prepare to die.\nHoward: My name is Darth Vader. I am your father. Prepare to die.\nSheldon: Ah, this is fun.\nLeonard: Well, good. It\u2019s nice to see your mind off Amy.\nBarry: What\u2019s going on with Amy?\nSheldon: Not that it\u2019s any of your business, but she broke up with me.\nBarry: Weawwy? Good to know.\nSheldon: Good to know? What\u2019s that supposed to mean?\nLeonard: Oh. I hate to say it, but it sounds like he\u2019s interested in her.\nSheldon: Well, that\u2019s unacceptable.\nLeonard: Oh, buddy, I get that you don\u2019t like it, but it\u2019s not really up to you.\nSheldon: Yeah, but he\u2019s dumb, and his face is dumb.\nLeonard: Look, even if it\u2019s not him, Amy\u2019s probably going to date someone at some point.\nSheldon: You really think so?\nLeonard: Of course. She deserves to be happy.\nSheldon: How dare you.\nScene: Later.\nLeonard: Listen, I should warn you that maybe asking Amy out isn\u2019t a good idea.\nSheldon: Barry, a word?\nLeonard: And now the crazy version of what I just said.\nSheldon: If you intend to pursue Amy, you leave me with no choice but to put a stop to it.\nBarry: And how are you gonna do that?\nSheldon: By challenging you to a duel.\nBarry: You\u2019ve had one wesson. I\u2019ll destwoy you.\nSheldon: That is why the duel will take place at high noon, three years from today. If you\u2019re worth your salt as an instructor, I should be ready by then. Yeah, and be warned. I\u2019m going to touch you all over.\nLeonard: Wow. That, that was crazier than I thought.\nScene: The comic book store.\nStuart: All right, I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s true, but let\u2019s, let\u2019s consider for a moment that possibly I\u2019m the problem.\nPenny: Yeah.\nBernadette: You are.\nAmy: You can say it.\nStuart: Okay, fine. What, I mean, what can I do? I get so nervous around women.\nPenny: Well, you\u2019re talking to us now. I mean, you don\u2019t seem nervous.\nStuart: Well, that\u2019s \u2019cause I\u2019m doing that trick where you imagine the audience is naked. By the way, thumbs up, ladies.\nAmy: Do you not hear how creepy that sounds?\nStuart: It was a joke.\nBernadette: Was it?\nStuart: No, I\u2019m still doing it.\nPenny: Okay. Don\u2019t be offended, but, what went wrong with you?\nStuart: I, I guess I assumed at this point in my life, I would be married or in a relationship, or even have a pet that didn\u2019t run away or kill itself.\nBernadette: That really happened?\nStuart: I mean, I can\u2019t say for sure, but I swear that rabbit looked me right in the eye before it hopped in front of that car. Anyway, the longer I\u2019m alone, the more desperate I get.\nAmy: Stuart, believe it or not, I understand. You know, before I met Sheldon, I was alone for a really long time. I was so desperate for people to like me, when I met these guys, it took everything in my power to hide my insecurity.\nStuart: Okay, we\u2019re all feeling it. Yes, I\u2019ll go out with you.\nAmy: Suddenly, the rabbit thing makes sense.\nScene: A sports bar.\nLeonard: I\u2019m surprised you wanted to go to a sports bar, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Look at this blister. Like it or not, we\u2019re athletes now. Besides, a bar is where I belong. I\u2019m having female problems.\nLeonard: If you\u2019re cranky and retaining water, I have a theory.\nHoward: Sheldon, instead of focusing on Amy dating other guys, maybe you should start thinking about dating another girl.\nSheldon: That\u2019s ridiculous.\nRaj: Why? You never thought you\u2019d end up in a relationship, and then you met Amy. Maybe there\u2019s someone else out there for you.\nSheldon: True, but Penny\u2019s married, and so is Bernadette. And your girlfriend has red hair and white skin, which really rubs up against my clown phobia.\nLeonard: Maybe you should consider women who aren\u2019t in serious relationships with your closest friends?\nSheldon: There\u2019s that prostate doctor, but I\u2019m still mad at her. Oh, there\u2019s a woman. I\u2019ll make her my girlfriend.\nRaj: Whoa, whoa. Walking up to a strange woman in a bar usually doesn\u2019t work.\nSheldon: You\u2019re forgetting something. Ladies love jocks.\nRaj: How many sips of that beer did he have?\nLeonard: Three.\nHoward: Oh, boy.\nSheldon: Excuse me. I\u2019m recovering from a recent breakup, and I\u2019m told asking out another woman might make me feel better. And as Ash Ketchum said to Pikachu, I choose you.\nWoman: What?\nSheldon: It\u2019s a Pok\u00e9mon reference.\nWoman: I don\u2019t know what that means.\nSheldon: Well, we gave it a shot. How about you?\nOlder woman: I\u2019m married, and I\u2019m her grandmother.\nSheldon: Ah, what might have been. And you, give my regards to Barnum and Bailey.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment.\nBernadette: Stuart took that rejection like a pro.\nPenny: Well, he knew he was on the breast cam.\nAmy: I don\u2019t have much experience turning men down. It wasn\u2019t so much fun.\nBernadette: Oh, you get used to it. Some guys you have to turn down over and over.\nPenny: And sometimes we marry them anyway.\nAmy (Phone text sound): Huh. Well, this is weird.\nPenny: What?\nAmy: Barry Kripke just asked me out.\nBernadette: Oh. Look at you, two guys in one day.\nPenny: I told you things would change if you plucked your eyebrows.\nBernadette: What did he say?\nAmy: Hi, how are you? I was wondering if you\u2019d like to get a drink after work sometime.\nPenny: Well, what are you gonna do?\nAmy: I don\u2019t know. I guess I assumed that I would eventually date other people, but this is happening so fast.\nBernadette: What can it hurt?\nAmy: Well, I was hoping the next person I dated would be a little less like Sheldon.\nBernadette: You mean, not a scientist?\nPenny: I think she means not a weirdo.\nBernadette: Are you attracted to him?\nAmy: I don\u2019t know.\nPenny: All right, well, what happens if you imagine him naked?\nAmy: Oh, I don\u2019t have to imagine it.\nScene: The stairwell.\nSheldon: I smell funny. I taste salty.\nLeonard: You\u2019re just sweaty from exercise.\nSheldon: And kind of delicious. I wonder how many licks it would take to get to the centre of me.\nLeonard: I know it only takes one doctor\u2019s finger.\nAmy: Hello.\nSheldon: Hello.\nLeonard: We should let you guys talk.\nBernadette: Yeah.\nSheldon: You don\u2019t have to leave.\nLeonard: Look at me go.\nAmy: Uh, Bernadette, you\u2019re my ride.\nBernadette: Walk.\nAmy: How have you been?\nSheldon: I\u2019m doing all right. I tried fencing today.\nAmy: How\u2019d that go?\nSheldon: It was pretty easy. And I think my background in mathletics helped. Barry Kripke was there. I should let you know that he expressed interest in asking you out.\nAmy: Well, actually, he, he already did.\nSheldon: Okay. But don\u2019t get too attached to him. in two years, 364 days, he\u2019s a dead man.\nAmy: I said no.\nSheldon: Interesting. I asked two women out today, and they both said no.\nAmy: I didn\u2019t know you were interested in dating.\nSheldon: I\u2019ve been told it\u2019s a good way to move on.\nAmy: Oh. Okay. Anyway, um, it\u2019s nice to see you. You look good.\nSheldon: Thanks. And I taste good too.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s kitchen.\nBernadette: Howie?\nHoward: What\u2019s up?\nBernadette: Why does your Fitbit say you ran 174 miles yesterday?\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "4_15": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The University cafeteria\nRaj: Here\u2019s what I wonder about zombies. (Others all groan) What happens if they can\u2019t get any human flesh to eat? They can\u2019t starve to death, they\u2019re already dead.\nHoward: You take this one. I spent an hour last night on how do vampires shave when they can\u2019t see themselves in the mirror?\nSheldon: Well-groomed vampires meet in pairs and shave each other. Case closed.\nRaj: Yeah, okay, so, zombies.\nLeonard: I guess it depends on the zombies, Raj. Are we talking slow zombies, fast zombies? Like, in 28 Days, if those zombies didn\u2019t eat, they starved.\nHoward: You\u2019re thinking of 28 Days Later. 28 Days is where Sandra Bullock goes to rehab and puts the audience into an undead state\nRaj: Hey, don\u2019t bag on Sandra Bullock! You think it makes you look cultured, but you just come off as bitter.\nLeonard: Oh, Dr. Siebert, twelve o\u2019clock.\nHoward: Why\u2019s the president of the university slumming in the cafeteria?\nSheldon: Perhaps he\u2019s emulating Shakespeare\u2019s Henry V, who dressed as a commoner and mingled among them, to find out how he was being perceived by his subjects. Course, if he\u2019d have read any of the thirteen hundred e-mails I\u2019ve sent him on the subject of his administration, he could have saved himself the trouble.\nRaj: Or maybe he heard it\u2019s Tator Tot Tuesday. That\u2019s why I\u2019m here.\nDr. Seibert: Hey, there\u2019s my favorite geniuses! How are we doing today?\nSheldon: That depends, how much longer do you plan on fondling my shoulder?\nSeibert: Sorry, Dr. Cooper, I forgot you have a touch phobia.\nSheldon: It\u2019s not a touch phobia, it\u2019s a germ phobia. If you\u2019d like to go put on a pair of latex gloves,\nI\u2019ll let you check me for a hernia.\nSeibert: Yeah. So, listen, fellas, who\u2019s up for a little party this Saturday night? Open bar, good eats, might even be a few pretty girls.\nRaj: Sounds great!\nHoward: I\u2019m in!\nSheldon: Hold on. Just because the nice man is offering you candy, doesn\u2019t mean you should jump into his windowless van. What\u2019s the occasion?\nSeibert: Just a little fund-raiser for the university.\nSheldon: Aha! The tear-stained air mattress in the back of the van.\nSeibert: I understand your reticence, Dr. Cooper, and I sympathize, but the hard facts are, occasionally, we have to shake a few hands and kiss a few butts to raise money for our research.\nSheldon: I don\u2019t care, it\u2019s demeaning. And I refuse to be trotted out and shown off like a prize hog at the Texas State Fair. Which, by the way, is something you don\u2019t want to attend wearing a Star Trek ensign\u2019s uniform.\nSeibert: All right, let me put it this way. You\u2019re gonna put on a suit, you\u2019re gonna come to this party, and you\u2019re gonna explain your research to a bunch of old people, or I swear to God, I\u2019ll blind you with a hot spoon, like they did to that little boy in Slumdog Millionaire.\nRaj: Oh, you don\u2019t want that.\nSeibert: So, Saturday night! It\u2019s gonna be off the hook.\nSheldon: Ugh!\nSeibert: Get over it.\nRaj: Oh, boy! Tator tots and a party invitation? What a great day!\nCredits sequence. \n \nScene: The apartment.\nPenny: There you go.\nLeonard: Are you sure this is right?\nPenny: Yeah, just tuck that part in your pants;\u00a0 you\u2019ll be fine.\nHoward: Okay, let\u2019s go smooch some rich, wrinkled tuckus.\nPenny: Oh, Howard, I can\u2019t believe Bernadette let you go to a fancy party wearing a dickey.\nHoward: Excuse me, my girlfriend doesn\u2019t pick out my clothes. My mother does.\nLeonard: Oh. We should get going.\nHoward: What about Sheldon?\nSheldon: Sheldon is not going.\nLeonard: Really? What do we tell Siebert?\nSheldon: Tell him Dr. Cooper feels that the best use of his time is to employ his rare and precious mental faculties to tear the mask off nature and stare at the face of God.\nPenny: Sheldon, it\u2019s Saturday night, you\u2019ll be doing laundry.\nSheldon: Don\u2019t tell him that, tell him the mask thing.\nScene: The party.\nHoward: Hey, put your tie back in your pants.\nLeonard: Thanks.\nRaj: Nice place. Reminds me of my parents\u2019 house back in New Delhi.\nHoward: You\u2019re kidding.\nRaj: No. We are very wealthy. But the only difference is, we have more servants.\nLeonard: More than this?\nRaj: More than we can use. You see, in India, we don\u2019t make the mistake of letting our poor people have dreams.\nSeibert: Ah. There\u2019s my band of brainiacs. Where\u2019s Dr. Cooper?\nLeonard: He\u2019s tearing the mask off nature to look at the face of God.\nSeibert: The board of directors insists he has a beautiful mind. I think he\u2019s just bananas. Come on, let me introduce you to one of the university\u2019s leading donors.\nRaj: I think we were misled about the cute girls.\nSeibert: Mrs. Latham, I\u2019d like you to meet three of our outstanding young researchers. This is Dr. Leonard Hofstadter, Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali and Howard Wolowitz.\nMrs Latham: Well, what happened to you, Wolowitz, couldn\u2019t stick with it long enough to get your PhD?\nHoward: I\u2019m an engineer. Most engineers don\u2019t bother with a PhD. But you may be interested to know I designed the zero-gravity waste-disposal system for NASA.\nMrs Latham: Got it, you\u2019re a space plumber.\nHoward: I\u2019m gonna go hit the bar.\nMrs Latham: Tell me about these two.\nRaj: Do him first.\nSeibert: Dr. Hofstadter is representing our experimental physics program tonight. I think you\u2019ll really enjoy hearing about his fascinating work.\nMrs Latham: Right. Fascinate me.\nLeonard: Uh.. b.. d.. uh.. uh..\nMrs Latham: They\u2019re cute when they\u2019re about to wet themselves, aren\u2019t they? I\u2019ll make it easy for you. When you arrive at the lab in the morning, what sort of machine do you turn on?\nLeonard: Coffee maker?\nMrs Latham: All right, Dr. Kooth\u2026 uh, whatever it is, you\u2019re up.\nRaj: It\u2019s Koothrappali. I have to tinkle.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: And so, instead of bowing to pressure, and going to that pointless soiree, I stayed right here and did a load of whites.\nAmy (on webcam): Well, normally I respect your macho rebellious attitude toward The Man, but, in this case, I think you\u2019ve made a foolish mistake.\nSheldon: Unlikely. But make your case. Keeping in mind that your critical attitude is ruining our Saturday night together, and I\u2019m not above minimizing your window.\nAmy: Sheldon, like it or not, until you manage to upload your intelligence into a self-sustaining orbiting satellite, equipped with high-speed Internet and a cloaking device, you will be dependent on other members of the human race.\nSheldon: That\u2019s it. Prepare to be minimized.\nAmy: I\u2019m not finished. All scientists have to fund-raise, Sheldon. How do you think I paid for my lab?\nI went to Saudi Arabia and met with a prince who had an interest in neurobiology.\nSheldon: Your lab is funded by some Middle-Eastern dilettante?\nAmy: Technically, Faisal is my fiance. But I do have a state-of-the-art two-photon microscope and a place to stay in Riyadh for the winter.\nSheldon: Well, that explains those puzzling camel race photos on your Facebook page.\nAmy: And consider this, without you to make the case for the physics department, the task will fall to people like Leonard and Rajesh.\nSheldon: Are you trying to scare me? \u2018Cause you\u2019re succeeding.\nAmy: Well, then prepare to be terrified. If your friends are unconvincing, this year\u2019s donations might go to, say, the geology department.\nSheldon: Oh, dear,not, not the dirt people!\nAmy: Or worse, it could go to the liberal arts.\nSheldon: No!\nAmy: Millions of dollars being showered on poets, literary theorists and students of gender studies.\nSheldon: Oh, the humanities!\nScene: The party.\nLeonard: On the bright side, I don\u2019t think President Siebert will be making us go to any more fund-raisers.\nHoward: It was so much easier at my bar mitzvah. The old people just came up to you, pinched your cheek and handed you a savings bond.\nRaj: Oh, don\u2019t be such gloomy Gusses. Look at the size of these shrimp! At what point do we start calling them lobsters?\nLeonard: Face it, Raj, we crashed and burned tonight.\nMrs Latham: Oh, you didn\u2019t do that badly.\nLeonard: Mrs. Latham, the first machine I turn on in the morning is the helium-neon laser, \u2019cause it needs to warm up.\nMrs Latham: I no longer care, dear. But don\u2019t worry, I really enjoyed meeting you this evening.\nLeonard: You\u2019re kidding. That was good for you? \u2018Cause I was sweating through my T-shirt.\nMrs Latham: Excellent! There\u2019s nothing I like better than making smart people feel ill at ease.\nLeonard: Why?\nMrs Latham: Oh, I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s one of the fun things you get to do when you have lots of money. Watch. Hey! Who said you could eat that shrimp? See? Fun.\nSheldon (behind them): No, no, no, I\u2019m just here for your money. I don\u2019t want to shake anyone\u2019s germy hands. Explain it to them, Siebert.\nScene: The apartment. \nSheldon (on phone): I must confess I don\u2019t understand you, President Siebert. First you say you want me to appear at your fund-raisers, but now you say you never want me to go anywhere near your fund-raisers. Forgive me, but that sounds like a mixed message. Here we go again. If there\u2019s simply no talking to me, why did you call? I\u2019m sorry, someone\u2019s on the other line. Why don\u2019t you see if you can organize your thoughts, and we\u2019ll try again later. Cooper-Hofstadter residence. Go for Cooper.\nGood morning, Mrs. Latham. Well, yes, of course I remember you. A woman well past her prime seeking to augment her social status by doling out her late husband\u2019s ill-gotten gains. So, how much money are you going to give me? I\u2019m not crazy, my mother had me tested. Well, if you\u2019re not going to give me money, then why are you calling? She wants to talk to you. Who\u2019s crazy now?\nLeonard: Hello, Mrs. Latham. Yes, I live with him. I don\u2019t, I, I really don\u2019t know why. Tonight? Sure, that\u2019d be great. Okay, I\u2019ll, I\u2019ll see you then. Bye. She wants to have dinner and talk about my research.\nSheldon: An entire dinner to talk about your research? Where you going, the drive-thru at Jack in the Box?\nLeonard: Well, wherever we\u2019re going, she\u2019s sending a car to pick me up.\nSheldon: Okay, I see what\u2019s happening.\nLeonard: What?\nSheldon: My stature intimidates her, so she\u2019s using you to get to me. Crafty old gal.\nLeonard: Excuse me, but you are not the only distinguished scientist in this apartment. I\u2019ve been published in peer-reviewed journals, I received a Dissertation of the Year award for experimental particle physics.\nSheldon: No, that can\u2019t be it. And since you seem to have forgotten, the reason we live together is we\u2019re best friends. And I got your back, Jack.\nSecne: Mrs Latham\u2019s car.\nLeonard: That was a great meal.\nMrs Latham: I\u2019m glad you enjoyed it.\nLeonard: The only time I eat this well is when my mom\u2019s in town and she takes me out to dinner.\nMrs Latham: Is that so?\nLeonard: You kind of remind me of her. She enjoys making people uncomfortable, too.\nMrs Latham: Well, you remind me of a boy I dated in college.\nLeonard: No kidding.\nMrs Latham: Sweet boy. Very smart. If only he\u2019d had money.\nLeonard: Yeah, um, so, hey, speaking of money, how are you feeling about helping the physics department get a cryogenic centrifugal pump and molecular sieve?\nMrs Latham: Well, I must say, you make a very persuasive case for it.\nLeonard: Oh, good, good.\nMrs Latham: And I\u2019m seriously considering taking it to the next level.\nLeonard: Terrific. Great. What level is that? (She grabs him and kisses him) Okay, now you don\u2019t remind me of my mom.\nScene: The apartment.\n \nSheldon: I\u2019m sorry, so, eventually, zombies are going to attack the rehab facility where Sandra Bullock is?\nPenny: Yes, Sheldon. Keep watching.\nSheldon: You know, it\u2019s a shame, all that work she\u2019s doing to get sober, only to be torn apart and eaten alive.\nHoward: Hey. How was dinner?\nLeonard: Swell. I need a drink. Do we have any alcohol?\nSheldon: No. But we have potatoes, I could make you vodka. It\u2019ll take two weeks.\nPenny: Leonard, are you okay?\nLeonard: Um, I\u2019m not sure.\nHoward: What\u2019s going on?\nLeonard: Well, Mrs. Latham said she was seriously considering donating money so we could get a cryogenic centrifugal pump.\nSheldon: Oh, wow!\nHoward: Yes!\nLeonard: Then she stuck her tongue down my throat.\nSheldon: Why?\nPenny: Okay, we can\u2019t keep explaining everything. Read that book we got you.\nLeonard: She hit on me.\nHoward: Wait-wait-wait. Are you telling us that old lady wanted to have sex with you in exchange for giving your department millions of dollars?\nLeonard: I think so.\nHoward: You lucky duck.\nPenny: You\u2019re really a broken toy, aren\u2019t you?\nLeonard: I was able to get out of there before anything else happened, but she wants to see me again tomorrow night.\nSheldon: Excellent! What are you planning to wear?\nLeonard: What?\nSheldon: Penny, you\u2019re an expert on trading sexual favours for material gain, walk him through this.\nLeonard: Well, n-no, hold on a second, I\u2019m not going to sleep with her.\nSheldon: But we need a cryogenic centrifugal pump.\nLeonard: Well, forget it! It\u2019s not gonna happen.\nSheldon: Well, come now, Leonard, this may be your only chance to make a real contribution to science!\nLeonard: I repeat, not gonna happen.\nPenny: What was all that about me trading sexual favours for material gain?\nSheldon: It was a compliment. I believe in giving credit where credit is due.\nScene: The apartment, the following night.\nSheldon (on phone): Okay, fine. I\u2019ll tell him. Leonard, Mrs. Latham\u2019s car is here for you.\nLeonard: I won\u2019t be too late. I\u2019m just gonna make a final pitch for the funding and then say good night.\nSheldon: Hold on, I have something for you.\nLeonard: What\u2019s this?\nSheldon: Just a few things you may need tonight. There\u2019s, uh, baby oil, condoms and, uh, a little something I procured from the school of pharmacology. They say it is to Viagra as Viagra is to a green M&M.\nLeonard: I am not going to have sex with her.\nSheldon: Maybe this will overcome your reluctance. I went on the Internet and found a photograph of a 25-year-old Mrs. Latham to get your libido humming. Check out those saddle shoes. Rar!\nLeonard: Are you insane? I\u2019m not going to prostitute myself just so we can get some new equipment.\nSheldon: Oh, come on! Why not?\nLeonard: Good night, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Given how much time you spend engaging in pointless self-abuse, you might consider, just this once, using your genitalia to actually accomplish something!\nPenny: He still won\u2019t shag the old lady, huh?\nSheldon: No. But thank you for asking.\nScene: Mrs Latham\u2019s car.\nLeonard: Hey. Hi.\nMrs Latham: Hello, Leonard. I hope you\u2019re hungry.\nLeonard: I\u2019m very hungry. For food, right?\nMrs Latham: Oh, I made you uncomfortable last night. I\u2019m so sorry.\nLeonard: No, that\u2019s okay.\nMrs Latham: No, it most certainly is not. Leonard, I\u2019m making the donation to your department regardless of what happens between us.\nLeonard: Really?\nMrs Latham: Well, of course. There\u2019s no quid pro quo here. You and your colleagues are doing remarkable research, and you deserve the money.\nLeonard: Oh. Then what was last night about?\nMrs Latham: I took a shot, sue me.\nLeonard: Oh.\nMrs Latham: You\u2019re a very handsome man, Leonard.\nLeonard: Thank you.\nMrs Latham: It was foolish of me to think someone your age might ever be interested in someone like me.\nLeonard: Oh, don\u2019t say that. You\u2019re a very attractive woman.\nMrs Latham: Oh, please.\nLeonard: No, it\u2019s true.\nMrs Latham: Well, aren\u2019t you sweet. Just for the record, you\u2019d remember a night with me for the rest of your life.\nLeonard: I\u2019m sure I would. But why, why, exactly?\nMrs Latham: You\u2019re a very smart man. How do you think I landed such a rich husband?\nLeonard: I hadn\u2019t really given it much thought.\nMrs Latham: Well, think about it.\nLeonard: Do you mean?\nMrs Latham: Yep. I\u2019m that good.\nLeonard: Oh, what the hell.\nScene: The stairwell. Leonard is returning home looking dishevelled.\nPenny: Good morning, slut.\nLeonard: What?\nPenny: Oh, please, I recognize the walk of shame when I see it. All you\u2019re missing is a little smeared mascara and a purse with panties wadded up in it.\nSheldon: What\u2019s going on?\nLeonard: Oh, nothing\u2019s going on. Excuse me.\nSheldon: Are you just getting home?\nLeonard: Yeah.\nSheldon: That\u2019s a good sign, right?\nPenny: Oh, yeah.\nSheldon: I\u2019m so proud of you! You sold yourself out like a common streetwalker!\nLeonard: No, I didn\u2019t do it for the money.\nSheldon: She stiffed you?\nPenny: I believe that\u2019s what your roommate did to her.\nSheldon: What?\nPenny: Again, read the book we gave you.\nLeonard: No, I mean, I, I, I got the money first.\nSheldon: Smart. Get paid up front. Yeah, I think you have a real knack for gigolo work, Leonard.\nLeonard: Uh, I\u2019m gonna go lie down.\nSheldon: That\u2019s a good idea, get your rest. There are a lot more rich old ladies out there, and Daddy needs a new linear accelerator. And I thought he didn\u2019t learn anything from his relationship with you.\nPenny: Hey!\nSheldon: Another compliment! Learn to recognize them.\nScene: The cafeteria.\nSeibert: Ah, there he is! The man of the hour! He took one for the team!\nLeonard: I didn\u2019t do it for the money!\nSeibert: Keep telling yourself that, it makes it easier. Trust me, I know.\nRaj: Cool, buddy! That\u2019s awesome!\nHoward: How was she?\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "8_3": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The apartment.\nHoward: So, how does this game work? I just throw it, like a real ball?\nLeonard: Yeah, just nice and easy, right over the plate.\nHoward: All right.\nRaj: You suck, Wolowitz.\nHoward: What\u2019s that about?\nRaj: I\u2019m heckling you. It\u2019s a beloved part of baseball.\nSheldon: He\u2019s right. And given that you\u2019re probably still waiting to be picked for a game that was played in fifth grade, I\u2019m sure you do suck.\nPenny: Hi. What\u2019s going on?\nLeonard: Baseball.\nPenny: Okay, this is not what I meant when I said go outside and play.\nLeonard: He\u2019s practicing.\nPenny: For what?\nHoward: The Angels wanted an astronaut to throw out the first pitch, so guess who they called?\nPenny: What, you? Really?\nHoward: Well, a lot of people who weren\u2019t available, but then me.\nPenny: That\u2019s so cool. Congratulations. I guess that makes you the athlete of the group.\nSheldon: Well, not just him. May I remind you that you\u2019re talking to the seeker, beater, chaser and water boy of the third place Griffith Park Quidditch team.\nPenny: I know. Watching your boyfriend run around with a broomstick between his legs isn\u2019t something you forget.\nLeonard: C\u2019mon now, throw one.\nHoward: All right, here we go.\nRaj: You look like a jackass.\nHoward: Cut it out. You\u2019re hurting my feelings.\nLeonard: Now you know why we\u2019re not outside.\nScene: The stairwell.\nSheldon: Did you enjoy my lecture?\nAmy: No, and neither did our waiter.\nSheldon: Well, if you\u2019re going to serve Cornish game hen, you should either be familiar with the history of Cornwall or be prepared to learn it.\nAmy: It\u2019s hard to argue with that. And I know because I saw a sad man with a pepper mill desperately try and fail.\nPenny: Hey, how was dinner?\nSheldon: Good, I had Cornish game hen.\nLeonard: Oh, that poor waiter.\nAmy: Sheldon, how about tomorrow night we see a movie?\nPenny: You guys are going out two nights in a row?\nSheldon: I missed a number of date nights while I was on my train trip, and I\u2019m contractually obligated to make them up under the terms of the Relationship Agreement.\nPenny: That\u2019s so hot.\nAmy: It\u2019s better than hot, it\u2019s binding.\nSheldon: If you\u2019re free tomorrow night, I\u2019d love to have you join us on a double date.\nPenny: Aw.\nAmy: You are aware that a double date doesn\u2019t count as two dates.\nSheldon: Oh. Well, then come or don\u2019t. I don\u2019t care.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s apartment.\nBernadette: I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re sore.\nHoward: Hey, even professional pitchers need a rubdown after the game.\nBernadette: But they throw an actual ball. You were throwing air at a TV.\nHoward: For your information, I also gave Leonard one hell of a high five.\nBernadette: I\u2019m kind of surprised you agreed to do this in front of a stadium full of people.\nHoward: They\u2019re doing Space Day and NASA asked me. I felt like I couldn\u2019t say no.\nBernadette: Okay. Well, if you want, I could help you practice. I played a lot of softball growing up.\nHoward: Thank you, that would be great.\nBernadette: Great. And while we\u2019re at it, maybe we could butch up your run for when you head out to the mound.\nHoward: What\u2019s wrong with the way I run?\nBernadette; Oh, just kidding. Nothing.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment.\nPenny: Sheldon, I\u2019m surprised you\u2019d choose to go to a pub.\nSheldon: At our committee meeting, Amy made a motion for a picnic in a park, but I tacked so many amendments on that thing it sank like a lead balloon.\nAmy: I then suggested a pub.\nSheldon: Yeah, which I was initially sceptical of until I saw online that they serve Yorkshire pudding.\nLeonard: You don\u2019t even like Yorkshire pudding.\nSheldon: No, it\u2019s yucky, but informing people about the history of Yorkshire is yummy, yum-yum.\nAmy: After a lively debate, that proposal passed by a two-zero margin.\nLeonard: Nice to see a busy couple keep the spark of bureaucracy alive.\nSheldon: Ignore them, Amy. They\u2019re just jealous because they\u2019ll never have a relationship as good as ours.\nPenny: Isn\u2019t this when he says bazooka or something?\nSheldon: I wasn\u2019t making a joke, I was merely stating fact. Amy and I have a superior relationship to yours.\nLeonard: You don\u2019t honestly think that, do you?\nSheldon: Leonard, I assumed you knew. The ranking of relationships in our circle by quality is me and Amy, Howard and Bernadette, Raj and his girlfriend, Penny and Chardonnay, Penny and you.\nLeonard: There isn\u2019t any ranking. And if there were, we wouldn\u2019t be at the bottom of it.\nPenny: Yeah, and actually, I drink Sauvignon Blanc.\nLeonard: That\u2019s the part you have a problem with?\nPenny: Relax.\nAmy: There they go, fighting again. You\u2019d never hear her talk that way to Sauvignon Blanc.\nScene: A gymnasium. \nRaj: So you never played baseball as a kid, not even Little League?\nHoward: Well, I was going to, but the day of tryouts I found my dad\u2019s Playboy collection. Threw my arm out.\nBernadette: All right, the pitcher\u2019s mound in Major League Baseball is sixty feet, six inches away from home plate.\nHoward: Great. You take this and say when to stop. How much further?\nBernadette: Keep going.\nHoward: How about now?\nBernadette: I\u2019ll let you know.\nHoward: Are you saying stop and we\u2019re just too far away to hear you?\nBernadette: Okay, stop.\nHoward: Are you kidding me?!\nBernadette: That\u2019s sixty feet.\nHoward: There\u2019s no way this is sixty feet.\nBernadette: I\u2019m looking at it.\nHoward: You realize this isn\u2019t one of those times I want you to exaggerate how long something is.\nScene: Amy\u2019s car.\nLeonard: Okay, I got to, I, I, I, I got to ask. What makes you think that your relationship is so wonderful and ours isn\u2019t?\nSheldon: For starters, we enjoy spending time together.\nLeonard: So do we. And I\u2019ve seen you guys ignore each other for hours doing totally different things.\nSheldon: It\u2019s called parallel play.\nLeonard: Yeah, toddlers do that.\nSheldon: Not as well as we do.\nLeonard: You believe this guy? He has to be the best at everything.\nPenny: So what? Why do you even care?\nSheldon: Oh, listen to them. Not even married and the honeymoon\u2019s over.\nLeonard: Whatever. You can\u2019t even go on a date without checking your relationship agreement.\nSheldon: If you\u2019ve got a problem basing a relationship on a contract, I\u2019d like to tell you about 13 plucky colonies that entered a relationship agreement called the U.S. Constitution. And it may not be cool to say so, but I think that love affair is still pretty hot today.\nAmy: It\u2019s a good thing I\u2019m not wearing flag underwear right now, \u2019cause there\u2019s about to be a fire.\nScene: The gym.\nBernadette: Okay, it\u2019s not that hard. You just look to where you want to throw it, step towards where you want to throw, and throw it.\nHoward: That\u2019s your help? That\u2019s like saying here\u2019s how you fly a plane, get in the airplane, know where you want to go and fly it.\nBernadette: Just throw the ball. Let\u2019s see what we\u2019re working with.\nRaj: Come on Howard, fire it in.\nBernadette: Throw the damn ball!\nScene: The pub.\nAmy: So when do you guys plan on getting married?\nPenny: Uh, we\u2019re not sure. But I want to wait long enough to prove to my mother I\u2019m not pregnant.\nSheldon: May I have one of your fries?\nAmy: Of course. Can I have a bite of your burger?\nSheldon: Absolutely not.\nLeonard: Some perfect couple. He won\u2019t even share his food with her.\nSheldon: It has avocado on it. She\u2019s allergic to avocado. Are you so jealous of our relationship you want Amy to die?\nLeonard: I\u2019m not jealous. I just think it\u2019s silly for you to compare relationships like they\u2019re something that can be quantified.\nSheldon: Everything is quantifiable. That French fry? A seven. Spider-Man? A nine. The number nine? Oddly, only a four.\nLeonard: How ridiculous is he?\nPenny: A hundred.\nLeonard: Sheldon, you\u2019re just assigning random numbers to things based on your opinion.\nSheldon: No, I\u2019m not. French fries have three variables, crispiness, saltiness and shape. Which is why a curly fry only gets a two. If I wanted curls for dinner, I\u2019d order a clown wig.\nPenny: Well, a relationship is more complicated than a French fry.\nSheldon: Not according to the work of Berscheid, Snyder and Omoto.\nPenny: Oh, what did those rascals do now?\nAmy: They developed the Relationship Closeness Inventory, which predicts the stability of a couple based on behaviour.\nSheldon: Yeah, not to be confused with the French Fry Goodness Inventory. That\u2019s pure Cooper.\nLeonard: So, this is accurate?\nSheldon: It\u2019s been around for 25 years, and has been extensively corroborated by other researchers.\nPenny: Well, kind of takes the romance out of relationships.\nSheldon: Kind of? It does it perfectly.\nAmy: Sheldon and I got an eight-point-two out of ten.\nLeonard: Fine. We\u2019ll take it right now.\nPenny: No, don\u2019t.\nLeonard: What?\nPenny: Just don\u2019t take it.\nLeonard: Why not?\nPenny: \u2018Cause it\u2019s stupid. Who cares what number it is?\nLeonard: Come on. It\u2019ll be fun.\nPenny: I said I don\u2019t want you to. I\u2019m getting another drink.\nLeonard: Sorry.\nAmy: I\u2019m gonna let you count this as two dates. They\u2019re a lot of work.\nScene: The gym.\nBernadette: Think he\u2019s getting any better?\nRaj: Yup.\nHoward: That was a close one.\nBernadette: Okay.\nRaj: Is it too late for him to cancel?\nBernadette: I think so.\nHoward: Heads up! Watch out!\nScene: The pub.\nLeonard: Are you mad at me?\nPenny: No, stop being stupid.\nLeonard: Um, whew? Is this about the test, or is this about us?\nPenny: Look, I don\u2019t need a score on a test to make me worry about something I\u2019m already worried about.\nLeonard: What are you worried about?\nPenny: That we\u2019re engaged and have nothing in common, and it scares me.\nLeonard: Yeah, that scares me, too.\nPenny: It does?\nLeonard: Sometimes.\nPenny: Well, that\u2019s not good. You being blindly infatuated with me was the rock we were building this relationship on.\nLeonard: Okay, well, this might make you feel better. Uh, we\u2019re both scared that our marriage will be a disaster, and so, that\u2019s something that we have in common. Also, we both think I\u2019m not funny. Huh? See, you\u2019re not laughing.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s apartment. \nMike (on Skype): Hey, Froot Loops, what\u2019s up?\nHoward: Hey, Mike. Listen, NASA asked me to throw out the first pitch at an Angels game. You got any advice?\nMike: Yeah. Don\u2019t do it. What else you up to?\nHoward: Why shouldn\u2019t I do it?\nMike: There\u2019s no upside. If you do well, no one cares. And if you screw up, you\u2019re an idiot on YouTube forever.\nHoward: But it\u2019s for a good cause. What about all the kids that\u2019ll be there?\nMike: That\u2019s what I\u2019m telling you. Kids are the worst. My own daughter tweeted I have a giant nose.\nHoward: Well, maybe I\u2019ll do a good job.\nMike: I don\u2019t know. In space, you couldn\u2019t even toss me a pen, and that was in zero gravity.\nHoward: Okay, thanks for the pep talk.\nMike: Anytime, Froot Loops. Give your wife a hug for me. She\u2019s so much cuter than you, I don\u2019t know how you ever got her.\nBernadette: He\u2019s so nice.\nScene: The pub.\nPenny: Hey, sorry about that.\nAmy: No, we\u2019re sorry. We never should have been comparing relationships in the first place.\nSheldon: Why? We won. You know, I say, next, we take on Koothrappali and his dog. Really give ourselves a challenge.\nLeonard: I just want to say one more thing about this. Just because Penny and I are very different people does not mean that we\u2019re a bad couple.\nSheldon: The answer is one simple test away. Hmm? You know, it\u2019s like when I thought there was a possum in my closet. Did I sit around wondering? No, I sent Leonard in with a pointy stick and a bag.\nLeonard: I killed his Chewbacca slippers.\nPenny: Let\u2019s just take the test.\nLeonard: No, no, no, I don\u2019t want to.\nPenny: Oh, well, \u2019cause you know we\u2019re gonna do bad.\nLeonard: Because it doesn\u2019t matter. I don\u2019t care if we\u2019re a ten or a two.\nSheldon: Or a one. A one is possible.\nLeonard: Marriage is scary. You\u2019re scared, I\u2019m scared. But it doesn\u2019t make me not want to do it. It, it just makes me want to hold your hand and do it with you.\nPenny: Leonard.\nAmy: It would make me so happy if you said things like that.\nSheldon: We got an eight-point-two. Trust me, you\u2019re happy.\nScene: Angels Stadium\nRaj: Mmm, I love how they put a waterfall at centre field. It really ties the whole stadium together.\nPenny: Look at you, talking sports.\nLeonard: This is fun, huh? We get to see our friend throw out the first pitch, have a hot dog, watch the game.\nSheldon: Whoa. Nobody said anything about watching the game.\nAmy: Sheldon, what did you expect?\nSheldon: I expected to see Howard throw the baseball, finish my hot dog, and hightail it across the street to Disneyland just in time for Mickey\u2019s Soundsational Parade.\nAmy: I\u2019ll tell you what. If we stay, I\u2019ll buy you cotton candy and a bobblehead.\nSheldon: Who\u2019s the bobblehead of?\nAmy: Does it matter?\nSheldon: No, as long as it bobbles.\nBernadette: Howie, I am so proud of you.\nHoward: Thanks. I\u2019m proud of me, too.\nMan: You ready?\nHoward: Let\u2019s do it.\nMan: All right.\nHoward: Wish me luck.\nBernadette: Go get \u2019em.\nStadium Announcer: Ladies and gentlemen, in honour of Space Day at Angel Stadium, the first pitch will be thrown out by NASA astronaut Howard Wolowitz.\nHoward: Thank you. Thank you.\nPenny: Can he really throw a ball?\nLeonard: On our Quidditch team, he\u2026\nPenny: Yeah, that\u2019s a no.\nHoward: I have a message for the young people here today. When I was asked to throw the first pitch, a little voice in my head said I couldn\u2019t do it. So, I practiced and practiced, and you know what? That little voice was right, but then I remembered that I\u2019m not an athlete. I\u2019m a scientist. So, today\u2019s first pitch will be delivered to home plate by science. Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, I present to you a working prototype of the Mars Rover. And here\u2019s the wind-up, and the pitch.\nBernadette: Why is it going so slow?\nHoward: \u2018Cause I\u2019m an idiot who didn\u2019t think this through.\nSheldon: Okay, new plan. We go to Disneyland, play hide and seek on Tom Sawyer\u2019s Island, and then come back and see the end of the pitch.\nHoward: Okay, while we\u2019re waiting for the ball to arrive, here\u2019s some fun facts about Mars.\nMan in Crowd: You suck, Wolowitz!\nSheldon: He makes a valid point.\nHoward: Okay, booing isn\u2019t gonna make it go any faster.\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "6_18": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The apartment\u00a0\nLeonard: Look, I know you guys don\u2019t want to do this, but we have no choice. So, you can either bitch and whine or we can just get it over with.\nHoward: I got whine.\nSheldon: I got the B word.\nLeonard: Yeah, well, it\u2019s in our contract to serve on a university committee. And frankly, this is one I believe in. Okay, here we go. Encouraging more women to pursue a career in the sciences.\nHoward: Come on, if I was any good at convincing women to do stuff, I wouldn\u2019t have spent so much of my twenties in the shower.\nSheldon: If you ask me, this whole thing is a waste of our time.\nLeonard: Helping women? Y\nSheldon: Helping anyone. People should take care of themselves.\nLeonard: Oh, like yesterday, when you made me drive you to the dry cleaners, the pharmacy and the post office?\nSheldon: I\u2019m not saying people can\u2019t use tools. Even an otter picks up a rock when he wants a clam.\nLeonard: You don\u2019t think it\u2019s worthwhile to try to get more women working in science.\nSheldon: I think that\u2019s incredibly sexist of you. I believe in a gender-blind society like in Star Trek, where women and men of all races and creeds work side by side as equals.\nLeonard: You mean where they were advanced enough to invent an interstellar warp drive, but a black lady still answered the space phone?\nHoward: Oh, I did spend a lot of my shower time with Lieutenant Uhura.\nSheldon: Howard\u2019s disturbing recollections aside, I don\u2019t appreciate being forced to do banal committee work.\nLeonard: Yes, I know, you\u2019re too smart for this.\nSheldon: Exactly. It\u2019s like asking the Human Torch to heat up your frozen burrito.\nLeonard: Got it. All right, I\u2019m thinking one way to counter bias in the peer-review process, is for papers to be submitted under gender-neutral names. Like S. Smith instead of Samantha Smith.\nSheldon: I suppose there is a history of professional women using their initials so as not to be pre-judged. Harry Potter\u2019s J.K. Rowling, uh, Star Trek\u2019s D.C. Fontana.\nHoward: Van Nuys pole-dancer D.D. Melons. All right, I think we\u2019ve really helped women today. Let\u2019s fire up the old Xbox.\nLeonard: Guys, please don\u2019t make this a school project where I\u2019m the smart kid doing all the work while the slackers sit back and watch.\nSheldon: We\u2019re not. This time you\u2019re the smart kid doing all the work while the even smarter kids sit back and watch.\nHoward: So, you think I\u2019m one of the smarter kids?\nSheldon: No, you\u2019re a tool I was using to make my point.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: Guys, our topic is encouraging women in science, can you at least play a less sexist game\nSheldon: How is it sexist? My character wields a battle axe as well as any man.\nHoward: Not to mention she has mammary glands that could nurse a family of 30. And have enough milk left over to open a Baskin Robbins.\nSheldon: Mother, warrior-princess, franchise owner, I hear glass ceilings shattering all over town.\nLeonard: Sheldon, you\u2019re always saying how much smarter you are than me. Spend five seconds and come up with one idea on how to get more women into science.\nSheldon: All your ideas address the issue at a university level. By then it\u2019s too late. You need to design an outreach program that targets girls at the middle school level and sets them on an academic track towards the hard sciences.\nLeonard: That\u2019s actually good. Why didn\u2019t I think of that?\nSheldon: Some people are otters, some people are rocks.\nLeonard: I wonder if there\u2019s a way we could give the idea a trial run.\nHoward: Maybe I could call my old middle school, see if we can talk to some of the female students.\nLeonard: That\u2019s great, try to set up something for the three of us to go over there.\nSheldon: Oh, hold on. While I\u2019m comfortable speaking about science, I\u2019m not sure I know how to spark the interest of schoolchildren. Better Google it.\nHoward: What exactly are you looking up?\nSheldon: How do I get 12-year-old girls excited.\nLeonard and Howard (together): No!\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment.\nRaj: Thanks again for letting me crash girls\u2019 night.\nPenny: Are you kidding? You brought fancy wine and made fondue. I\u2019ve slept with guys for less. It\u2019s a joke. Based on real events.\nRaj: Anyway, I was hoping I could, uh, pick your brains a little. I\u2019m supposed to take Lucy out Friday and I need a killer first date.\nAmy: Well, evolutionary biology says that women are attracted to a man who is steady n the face of danger, so I recommend an unsafe environment. Seedy bar on the wrong side of the tracks, picnic near a lunatic asylum, a wine tasting on Skid Row.\nRaj: Uh, Lucy has some, uh, social anxiety issues. Maybe we could start with something simpler.\nBernadette: Why don\u2019t you take her to Disneyland? You go on Space Mountain, you\u2019re in the dark, she\u2019s holding onto you.\nPenny: Yeah, but you just have to remember, that ride is shorter than you think and they take a picture of you at the end, so make sure you got your clothes back on. It\u2019s a joke. Based on real events.\nRaj: Mm, Disneyland? I don\u2019t know. With all the crowds and the weird characters walking around, just reminds me too much of India.\nAmy: I haven\u2019t been to Disneyland since I was a kid. We should definitely go one weekend.\nBernadette: Weekends are too crowded.\nPenny: So, blow off work, go on a weekday.\nAmy: Hooky? I\u2019ve never played hooky in my life. My mom said that\u2019s how girls end up addicted to reefer and jazz music.\nPenny: It\u2019s more like how girls end up at a Best Western hotel with a 34-year-old guy named Luther.\nBernadette: Joke?\nPenny: I can laugh about it now.\nBernadette: So, what do you say? This Friday we ditch work and go to Disneyland?\nPenny: I\u2019m in.\nAmy: Me, too.\nRaj: Excuse me, I thought we were trying to solve my problem?\nPenny: Oh, yeah, right. Wait, what was your problem again?\nRaj: I am a man who can\u2019t talk to women, trying to figure out how to go on a romantic date with a girl who suffers from such crippling social anxiety she can\u2019t be around other people.\nPenny: Yeah, that\u2019s a toughie.\nBernadette: Let\u2019s think.\nAmy: Hmm. We doing just Disney or California Adventure, too?\nScene: A school hallway.\nLeonard: It\u2019s nice of your old school to let us try out our science talk on some female students.\nHoward: Well, they\u2019re actually pretty excited. I\u2019m their most famous alum. If you don\u2019t count the serial killer who ate all those prostitutes.\nSheldon: This must feel pretty good for you, coming back to your alma mater as an astronaut.\nHoward: Yeah, last time I was here, I was just a scrawny little nerd.\nLeonard: And now you\u2019re also an astronaut.\nHoward: So many memories. I mean, how many times in these hallways was I tripped, punched and spit on? Oh, look, here\u2019s my old locker. I have a masters in engineering and I still can\u2019t figure out how Scott Kapinski got me and my briefcase to fit in there. (Kid bumps into him) Hey.\nKid: What?\nHoward: Nothing.\nSheldon: Smart. We don\u2019t want any problems.\nScene: Bernadette\u2019s car.\nAmy: I can\u2019t believe I ditched work for Disneyland.\nBernadette: What did you tell your boss?\nAmy: Oh, I was very clever, I did it in stages. At seven o\u2019clock last night, I called about a problem at the lab and casually mentioned I was going out for seafood. At nine thirty, I called and told him that one of my scallops tasted weird. At eleven thirty, I called and said I was throwing up like a fire hose. At twelve forty-five, I called and made nothing but dry heaving sounds, and now I\u2019m going to Disneyland.\nBernadette: Penny, what did you say?\nPenny: I work at the Cheesecake Factory, I said bye.\nAmy: So, what are we gonna do first?\nBernadette: I don\u2019t know about you guys, but I\u2019m gonna make a beeline for the place that gives you a princess makeover.\nAmy: Ooh, that sounds like fun.\nPenny: You\u2019re kidding, right? We\u2019re not just gonna get drunk and go on rides?\nAmy: Come on, do it with us.\nPenny: All right, whatever. How does it work?\nBernadette: Okay, so, you pick your princess, Sleeping Beauty, Snow White, Cinderella, they give you hair, makeup, the works.\nPenny: Guess it would be fun to be Cinderella.\nAmy: Oh, I want to be Cinderella, too.\nPenny: Yeah.\nBernadette: We can\u2019t all be Cinderella.\nAmy: Then how do we decide?\nBernadette: Well, it\u2019s simple. This was my idea. I\u2019m driving. I\u2019m Cinderella. You bitches got a problem with that, we could stop the car right now.\nScene: A library.\nRaj: Excuse me, I\u2019m meeting a girl here. It\u2019s kind of our first date.\nMan: In a library?\nRaj: She and I are both a little awkward in social situations, so this seemed like a good idea.\nMan: People say I\u2019m a little awkward, too. May I join you?\nRaj: No, you can\u2019t join us. Just go, go climb back up whatever beanstalk you came down from.\nMan (to Lucy): You can do better.\nLucy: Oh, we\u2019re eating here? (Reading) We\u2019re having a texting date? (By text) I love that.\nRaj (by text): As you\u2019re reading, it will help to remember I have an adorable accent.\nScene: A classroom.\nLeonard: Okay, who\u2019s ready for some science? Me, too. Okay, I am Dr. Leonard Hofstadter. I am here with my friends Dr. Cooper and real-life astronaut Howard Wolowitz, and we are going to show you girls how cool a job in science can be. How cool, you ask? Well, how about negative 273 degrees, \u2019cause that\u2019s the temperature at which entropy reaches its minimum value. Did I just learn something new and have fun doing it? What? All right. So now let\u2019s bring out theoretical physicist Dr. Sheldon Cooper.\nSheldon: Hello, female children. Allow me to inspire you with a story about a great female scientist. Polish-born, French-educated Madame Curie. Co-discoverer of radioactivity, she was a hero of science, until her hair fell out, her vomit and stool became filled with blood, and she was poisoned to death by her own discovery. With a little hard work, I see no reason why that can\u2019t happen to any of you. Are we done? Can we go?\nLater.\nHoward: The thing to remember is you can go to outer space, too. I mean, look at me. I went to this very school. Those desks you\u2019re sitting in, I was once superglued to one of them.\nGirl: Did you go to the moon?\nHoward: No, but I did go to the International Space Station.\nGirl: Did you fly the rocket?\nHoward: No, but I was in the rocket. I didn\u2019t actually\u2026\nGirl: So you just flew around? That\u2019s kind of like my uncle. He\u2019s a flight attendant.\nHoward: No, I\u2019m an American hero. Your uncle brings people nuts, okay?\nLeonard: Alright, alright. Boy, we are learning a lot here, huh? Thank you, astronaut Howard. Um, I am what\u2019s called an experimental physicist, which is super-fun, because I get to test theories and work with lasers. Yes?\nGirl 2: How did you decide to become a scientist?\nLeonard: Uh, excellent question. Um, I suppose I\u2019ve always been into science, you know. My mother and father are scientists, so I was kind of led in that direction. Uh, pushed might be a better way to describe it. To be honest with you guys, when I was your age, I wanted to be a rap star. Like Snoop Dogg, but with a healthy respect for the police. Yeah, no, sure, you laugh. Just like my mother did. After I confided, I was derided and chided, my moms and I collided. She said my dreams were misguided. That\u2019s just a little freestyle.\nScene: The library.\nRaj (by text): My dad\u2019s a gynaecologist in India, so if you\u2019re over there and need a check up, as he likes to say, he\u2019s at your cervix.\nLucy(by text): That\u2019s terrible. Your dad should be sent to the pun-itentiary.\nRaj (by text): That\u2019s a fitting pun-ishment. I still don\u2019t know what you do for a living.\nLucy (by text): Web design.\nRaj (by text): Anything I might have seen?\nLucy (by text): I don\u2019t know. You ever look at porn Web sites?\nRaj (by text): No, never. What is porn?\nLucy (by text): Sorry. Autocorrect. That was supposed to say prom Web sites.\nRaj (by text): Ooh, fun. I love prom. The romance, the gowns, it\u2019s like a fairy tale come to life. Sorry. Autocorrect. That was supposed to say, I like sports.\nScene: The classroom.\nLeonard: I never wanted to play the cello. How do you meet girls playing the cello? Hey, you want to come over to my house and listen to me play an instrument that sounds like a suicidal bumblebee?\nHoward: Quick, pull the fire alarm. Let\u2019s get out of here.\nSheldon: Uh, hello again. Um, yeah, I don\u2019t know if women in general have been actively discouraged from pursuing the sciences, but it\u2019s clear you young women here, today, have been. While I was listening to my colleagues waste your time, it occurred to me that it might be much more meaningful to hear about women in science from actual women in science, and, uh, I happen to know two brilliant examples who have agreed to speak to you on the phone right now. Uh, Dr. Rostenkowski, Dr. Fowler, are you there?\nAmy (voice): We\u2019re here.\nSheldon: Thank you for taking time out of your very busy schedule to enlighten these young women.\nAmy: It\u2019s our pleasure. I\u2019m Dr. Fowler, and I\u2019m a neuroscientist.\nBernadette: And I\u2019m Dr. Rostenkowski Wolowitz, and I\u2019m a microbiologist.\nAmy: The world of science needs more women, but from a young age, we girls are encouraged to care more about the way we look than about the power of our minds.\nBernadette: That\u2019s true. Every one of you has the capacity to be anything you want to be.\nPenny: Unless you want to be Cinderella.\nBernadette: Come at me. See what happens.\nScene: The library.\nRaj (by text): This was really fun.\nLucy : My battery\u2019s dying, so I\u2019m just gonna talk. Thanks for today. I\u2019ve been trying to do more things that scare me, and coming here was definitely one of them. But it was also really nice. So thanks, and, um, I\u2019m gonna go. Maybe I could do one more scary thing before I go and give you a kiss good-bye? You know, if that\u2019s okay. Okay. Panic attack. Maybe next time.\nRaj: I\u2019m counting that as foreplay.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s apartment.\nHoward: Bernie, I\u2019m home. You have fun today?\nBernadette: Yes, and I have a surprise for you.\nHoward: Please be Cinderella. Please be Cinderella.\nBernadette: Well, hello, Prince Charming.\nHoward: Milady.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment.\nLeonard: Hey, how was your\u2026 what?\nPenny: I can explain. I played hooky with the girls, then we all went to Disneyland and got\u2026 What are you doing?\nLeonard (undressing): Disneyland. Go on, I\u2019m listening.\nScene: The apartment.\nAmy: Sheldon, all Snow White needs is one little kiss to wake up.\nSheldon: Heard you the first time.\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "9_13": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The apartment.\nPenny: Hey, so I saw a movie trailer the other day. How could Batman possibly fight Superman? I mean, isn\u2019t that dumb?\nBernadette: Maybe he uses Kryptonite.\nEmily: Well, Batman\u2019s got a lot of money. Maybe he builds a suit that can do everything Superman can do.\nPenny: No, no, no, no, no. I\u2019ve seen that movie. It\u2019s called Iron Man.\nLeonard: What is happening?\nHoward: I don\u2019t know.\nRaj: But it\u2019s beautiful.\nPenny: And now Ben Affleck is Batman?\nEmily: Oh, he was great in Shakespeare in Love.\nPenny: Ooh, we should watch that next girls\u2019 night.\nBernadette: We could do a double feature with the Leonardo Di Caprio Romeo and Juliet.\nPenny: Oh, I love me some Leo.\nLeonard: And it\u2019s gone.\nSheldon: Oh, hello, everyone. I am happy to report I\u2019m feeling much better.\nLeonard: Good for you.\nSheldon: My fever is gone, my sinuses are pressure-free, and my mucus is as clear as a Yosemite waterfall.\nHoward: Glad to hear it.\nSheldon: I\u2019ll be able to return to work tomorrow.\nRaj: Yay.\nSheldon: Well, why isn\u2019t everyone happy? Your little ray of sunshine is ready to beam again.\nPenny: You really don\u2019t know why?\nSheldon: No. But I knew that his yay was sarcastic. Not bad for a guy whose last bowel movement sounded like rain on a roof.\nLeonard: Let me refresh your memory.\nFlashback\nSheldon: Penny, rub Vicks on my chest.\nPenny: Sheldon, I cooked you breakfast. I made your bed. I checked your mouth for thrush. You can rub your own chest.\nSheldon: Oh, sure, grope every other male on the planet, but draw the line with me.\nFlashback\nBernadette: I brought you a little care package from work. It\u2019s our latest antiviral and the best decongestant we make.\nSheldon: I hope laughter is the best medicine, \u2019cause this care package is a joke.\nHoward: Hey, she came all the way here\u2026\nBernadette: You\u2019re gonna want to take these with food.\nFlashback\nRaj: Sheldon, stop being a baby and let Emily take a look at you.\nSheldon: She\u2019s a dermatologist.\nEmily: I went to medical school.\nSheldon: Well, in that case, try removing the irritating patch of brown skin standing next to you.\nFlashback\nLeonard: All right, here you go.\nSheldon: Leonard, I\u2019m dying.\nLeonard: You\u2019re not dying. It\u2019s just the flu.\nSheldon: I asked for chicken noodle. This is chicken and stars. It\u2019s killing me.\nBack to the present.\nSheldon: I never did get that chicken noodle, did I?\nCredits sequence.\nScene: Sheldon\u2019s bedroom.\nAmy (on Skype): Hi, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Hello.\nAmy: Are you feeling any better?\nSheldon: Physically, yes, but I\u2019m upset because everyone\u2019s mad at me for no good reason.\nAmy: Why don\u2019t you tell me what happened, and in a gentle, loving way, I\u2019ll explain to you why you\u2019re wrong.\nSheldon: You know how, when you\u2019re sick, you\u2019re allowed to be cranky and say whatever you want and other people\u2019s feelings don\u2019t matter?\nAmy: Ooh. Gentle and loving, this is gonna be tricky.\nSheldon: I had a hundred and one fever. If that\u2019s not a time to verbally abuse my loved ones, when is?\nAmy: Sheldon, when you\u2019re sick, you can be unbearable. That\u2019s why your friends have been known to work late or sneak out to the movies or stay at a neurobiology conference three days after it\u2019s ended.\nSheldon: You stayed in Michigan all week to avoid being around me?\nAmy: No, no, not just that. I mean, Detroit is beautiful when it\u2019s sleeting.\nSheldon: You know, I\u2019m not the only one who\u2019s unpleasant when they\u2019re sick. When Penny got food poisoning, she threw up so loudly I could barely hear the television.\nAmy: Ooh, I just heard something. Might be hail, might be gunfire. Either way, I\u2019m gonna go take pictures. Bye.\nScene: The comic book store.\nRaj: Hey, Stuart.\nStuart: Hey. Where\u2019s Sheldon? Still sick?\nLeonard: No, he\u2019s fine. We just needed a little break.\nStuart: Yeah, I get that. When I brought him his comics the other day he said, oh great, death is literally at my door.\nHoward: He was being a jerk to everyone. Don\u2019t take it personally.\nStuart: Oh, I\u2019m on so many antidepressants, I couldn\u2019t if I wanted to.\nRaj: I wish we could do more stuff without Sheldon.\nLeonard: I wish that all the time. Usually before I blow out birthday candles.\nHoward: You know, Amy took some time off from him. Really improved their relationship.\nRaj: Huh. Okay. As long as it doesn\u2019t end with us having coitus with him, I\u2019m in.\nHoward: We should all take a trip or something.\nLeonard: Well, you know, Penny and I have been talking about taking a weekend in Vegas. Maybe we should all go.\nHoward: Bernie would love that.\nRaj: Oh, Ooh, maybe we could get one of those party buses to take us there.\nLeonard: That sounds really fun.\nRaj: Yeah, that sounds fun. A party-bus party don\u2019t stop. Ooh, when I say party, you say bus.\nLeonard: No.\nHoward: No.\nLeonard: No.\nHoward: No.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: So, the guys and I were talking about renting a party bus and everyone going to Vegas.\nPenny: Oh, that could be fun. But just to be clear, you mean a party bus with booze and music, right, not, like, juice boxes and video games?\nLeonard: Yes. And Howard\u2019s birthday was a drop-off party, you didn\u2019t have to stay.\nPenny: Well, I\u2019m in. When are we going?\nLeonard: This weekend.\nSheldon: Oh, where are we going?\nLeonard: Well, Vegas, but\u2026\nSheldon: Ugh, Atlantic City without the taffy? No, thank you.\nLeonard: That\u2019s fine, \u2019cause actually you\u2019re not invited.\nSheldon: Well, now, well, that\u2019s hurtful.\nPenny: Oh, Sheldon, you don\u2019t even like it there.\nSheldon: I can consider a place America\u2019s urinal cake and still enjoy the occasional visit.\nLeonard: Not this time.\nSheldon: Oh, fine. Then I\u2019ll just hang out with Wolowitz.\nLeonard: He\u2019s coming, too.\nSheldon: Well, then Raj and I will\u2026\nLeonard: Nope.\nSheldon: Very well. Stuart.\nLeonard: Oh, great. Do that.\nSheldon: Ugh. Stuart.\nScene: Sheldon\u2019s bedroom. \nAmy (on Skype): Hi, Sheldon. What\u2019s new?\nSheldon: Our friends are jerks, and I\u2019m mad at all of them.\nAmy: I said what\u2019s new, but sure.\nSheldon: Can you believe they planned a trip to Las Vegas and didn\u2019t invite me?\nAmy: Did you refuse to apologize and act like they were stupid for being mad?\nSheldon: You know, I liked it better when there was still a little mystery left in our relationship.\nAmy: Everyone tried to take care of you, and you were nothing but mean to them.\nSheldon: I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re not on my side. I was on your side when someone stole your car radio.\nAmy: Who else\u2019s side could you have been on?\nSheldon: I don\u2019t know. A music-loving hobo with a heart of gold?\nAmy: Sheldon, I understand that you\u2019re upset because you feel left out, but I don\u2019t know why we\u2019re even talking about this. Just apologize to them.\nSheldon: Fine, if that\u2019s what it takes to go on their dumb trip.\nAmy: Maybe you could try apologizing because you actually feel bad. It\u2019s called empathy. It\u2019s something you could work on.\nSheldon: I have empathy. Watch. Leonard made me soup, and I was mean to him.\nAmy: Great. Now try it as if this isn\u2019t your first day as a person.\nSheldon: Fine. Leonard made me soup, and I was mean to him. Hey, I felt a little something. Let me try again. Leonard made me soup, and I was mean to him. I was mean to him. He must have felt terrible. Oh, now I feel terrible. Neat.\nAmy: Glad I could help.\nSheldon: Now let me see you feel bad for lying and staying in Detroit longer than you needed to.\nAmy: I feel so, so bad.\nSheldon: Hey, we\u2019re both great at this.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Leonard, get ready for an apology. And with the added twist of an M. Night Shyamalan movie, I\u2019m going to mean it.\nLeonard: Ah, so like every other M. Night Shyamalan movie I\u2019ve seen, you spoil it in advance.\nSheldon: Hey, if you didn\u2019t know Bruce Willis was dead the whole time, that\u2019s not on me. Okay. Here it comes. You tried to take care of me when I was sick, and I was mean to you. There\u2019s no excuse for that. And I\u2019m truly sorry.\nLeonard: Thank you. I appreciate that.\nSheldon: I want you to know that that is sincere. I do feel bad. I\u2019m not just saying it to be included on your trip.\nLeonard: Appreciate that, too.\nSheldon: Terrific. Now all that\u2019s left is for you to invite me to come, me to ask are you sure, you to say absolutely, and then me to bring it home with, how could I say no to that face?\nLeonard: You\u2019re still not coming.\nSheldon: What? I apologized and I meant it. I know that we don\u2019t play this game very often, but you\u2019re doing it wrong.\nLeonard: Sheldon, I accept your apology, but you upset a lot of people while you were sick. I\u2019m not in a position to just say you can come.\nSheldon: Well, all right. What if I apologize to all of them?\nLeonard: Fine, if you apologize to everyone, they all say it\u2019s okay, then yes, you can come.\nSheldon: Challenge accepted. Sounds like it\u2019s time for the Sheldon Cooper Apology Tour.\nLeonard: Well, I hope it\u2019s as much fun as the Sheldon Cooper Spell-Checks Local Menus Tour.\nSheldon: My goodness, do you remember comes with apsparagus?\nScene: Howard and Berndette\u2019s house.\nSheldon: Howard and Bernadette, you tried to comfort me when I was ill, and I treated you terribly. I\u2019m sorry.\nHoward: Wow. I\u2019m impressed.\nSheldon: No, no, no, wait. I\u2019m not done. Allow me to underscore my sentiment with a haunting rendition of Brenda Lee\u2019s I\u2019m Sorry played on the pan flute.\nHoward: Apology accepted.\nBernadette: Forgiven, forgiven.\nSheldon: All right, that\u2019s eight hours of practice down the drain. And to memorialise this occasion, here are your commemorative T-shirts.\nHoward: Sheldon Cooper apologized to me\nBernadette: And he made it all better.\nScene: The apartment bathroom.\nSheldon: All you did was offer maternal care and affection, and all you received in return was rude and insensitive behavior.\nPenny: Can this wait?\nSheldon: I\u2019m afraid it can\u2019t. The trip is tomorrow. And I have more apologies to make.\nPenny: Okay, fine, I accept your apology, now get out.\nSheldon: Wonderful. would you mind holding up this shirt while I take a quick\u2026?\nPenny: Leonard.\nScene: The comic book store.\nSheldon: You brought me my comic books when I wasn\u2019t feeling well. That, that was thoughtful. And I was insensitive. I\u2019m sorry.\nStuart: Thank you, Sheldon. I appreciate that.\nSheldon: And I want you to know that I mean it, you know? This isn\u2019t me just wanting to go on the trip to Las Vegas.\nStuart: What trip to Las Vegas?\nSheldon: The one everyone\u2019s taking this weekend on the party bus.\nStuart: Of course, I wasn\u2019t invited.\nSheldon: That would be my understanding. On a less painful subject, what size T-shirt do you take?\nScene: Raj\u2019s apartment.\nSheldon: Raj, you were being a good friend, and my illness was no excuse for my behaviour. I hope that you can accept my apology.\nRaj: Of course I do.\nSheldon: And, Emily, I\u2019m sorry for saying dermatologists aren\u2019t real doctors. And I\u2019m sure you\u2019re tired of hearing that.\nEmily: Do you honestly think I hear that a lot?\nSheldon: Well, I would imagine when your job is popping zits and squirting Botox into old lady faces\u2026\nRaj: Okay, okay, the point is that we accept your apology.\nEmily: Uh, maybe you do. He just insulted me again.\nRaj: Yeah, but he doesn\u2019t mean it.\nEmily: Why are you defending him?\nSheldon: I believe I can answer that. Uh, like me, Raj is demonstrating empathy. Now, why don\u2019t you accept my apology receive your free T-shirt, uh, I hope extra small is okay. For some reason Wolowitz took a medium.\nEmily: Well, I don\u2019t accept your apology.\nRaj: What are you doing?\nEmily: It\u2019s called standing up for myself. You should try it some time.\nRaj: Fine, how about this? You\u2019re making me uncomfortable by prolonging this ridiculous fight, and I wish you\u2019d stop.\nEmily: Oh, you want me to stop? No problem.\nRaj: No, come on, please don\u2019t leave.\nSheldon: Point of clarification, are you still going on the trip? Because if not\u2026\nEmily: Don\u2019t worry, you\u2019re good.\nSheldon: I caused that fight, I feel terrible. Wait, I can do that better. I caused that fight. I feel terrible. Yeah, wow, I don\u2019t know which one I like more.\nScene: The apartment.\nPenny: So, was the fight really bad?\nSheldon: No. As a fight, it was excellent. She used harsh language and slammed the door. Although as I say this, that might not have been what you were asking.\nLeonard: You think they\u2019ll still go on the trip?\nSheldon: All I know is after the fight I went to Emily\u2019s to smooth\u2026\nLeonard: They\u2019re not going on the trip.\nPenny: No.\nRaj: What is wrong with you?\nSheldon: Look at him, caring about what\u2019s wrong with me. That is some top-shelf empathy. Hey, well, we should start a club.\nRaj: You went to Emily\u2019s to apologise, and when you left, she was crying.\nSheldon: That is true. Well, I suppose I should apologize again.\nAll: No.\nPenny: Is she okay?\nRaj: Yeah, I calmed her down, but she\u2019s not going to Vegas if he\u2019s going.\nHoward: Wait, that\u2019s an option? I didn\u2019t know that was an option.\nSheldon: Well, that is fine, because I\u2019ve decided that I won\u2019t be joining you. I\u2019ve realized that the most genuine way to demonstrate the remorse I feel is to let you have this weekend to yourselves.\nRaj: That\u2019s very mature of you.\nSheldon: Well, I\u2019ve been on a little trip myself recently. Not to Sin City but to Sincere City. Where instead of genital warts, the only growth you\u2019ll come back with is personal growth.\nPenny: And there\u2019s your next T-shirt.\nScene: The party bus. \nHoward: Ooh, check out the stripper pole.\nBernadette: You know what that means.\nLeonard: That Raj\u2019ll be on it before we make it to the freeway?\nRaj: You know it. Oo-ah, oo-ah.\nBernadette: This is so cool.\nPenny: Here\u2019s some champagne.\nLeonard: Mm-hmm. Well, I would like to propose a toast to a well-deserved weekend of\u2026\nSheldon: Aha.\nLeonard: What are you doing?\nSheldon: My plan was to jump out at the state line, but one of my nose plugs fell into the toilet.\nPenny: You couldn\u2019t give us just one weekend?\nStuart: I told him this was a bad idea.\nLeonard: What do we do, kick them off?\nPenny: If we drop them off at a fire station, they have to take them, no questions asked.\nSheldon: Before you do, please give me one more chance to apologize to Emily.\nRaj: Oh, God.\nSheldon: Emily, as I\u2019m sure you know, I\u2019m considered an odd fellow. But what you don\u2019t know is that, while I often say the wrong thing, in my heart I mean well. I think that you are a smart and wonderful woman, you know? And we all think that you can do better than Koothrappali.\nRaj: You know, Sheldon\u2026\nEmily: Shh, let him finish.\nSheldon: So, for all the times I\u2019ve offended you and all the times that I\u2019ll offend you in the future, I\u2019m sorry.\nEmily: Thank you.\nSheldon: Good. Then I\u2019ll be leaving now.\nEmily: Oh, it\u2019s okay, Sheldon. Come with us.\nSheldon: Oh, that\u2019s very kind of you. But I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll all have a better time without me. Let\u2019s go, Stuart.\nStuart: But I want to stay.\nSheldon: Stuart, now.\nEmily: You know, I know he\u2019s a jerk, but I actually feel bad for him.\nPenny: And now you see the problem.\nLeonard: Come on, you pain in the ass.\nSheldon: That\u2019s me. Bye, Stuart.\nStuart: Wait. I\u2019m a pain in the ass, too.\nScene: Later on the party bus.\nSheldon: Are you relieved that you and Raj were able to patch things up?\nEmily: At the moment? No, not really.\nPenny: Shake it, baby.\nBernadette: Ooh, work that thing.\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "8_18": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The lobby.\nSheldon: Two one six four two zero one nine eight nine. And that, little lady, is pi to a thousand places.\nAmy: I\u2019d say I\u2019m sorry I asked, except I didn\u2019t.\nSheldon: Oh, look, it\u2019s the Scientific American that covered the paper Leonard and I wrote.\nAmy: Oh, let me see.\nSheldon: I have mixed feelings about doing interviews. I like the part where I talk. I do not like the part where the other man talks.\nAmy: Sheldon, this article doesn\u2019t mention Leonard at all.\nSheldon: Well, that can\u2019t be right.\nAmy: It only refers to Dr. Cooper and his team. Did you even talk about him?\nSheldon: All I did was answer a few questions about the theory. And then expressed my gratitude that Scientific American doesn\u2019t include any of those smelly perfume cards.\nAmy: Poor Leonard.\nSheldon: Why? The theory he came up with just got mentioned in Scientific American. He ought to be thrilled.\nAmy: He might not be.\nSheldon: Oh, maybe you\u2019re right. He is kind of a lump.\nAmy: Think about it. How would you feel if you were referred to as part of Leonard\u2019s team?\nSheldon: Oh, I\u2019d be incensed.\nAmy: So you see what I\u2019m getting at?\nSheldon: Squeaky wheel gets the grease?\nAmy: No.\nSheldon: Grass is always greener?\nAmy: Try again.\nSheldon: Well, I don\u2019t know, we\u2019re all Groot? Just tell me.\nAmy: Leonard is as much a part of this paper as you are, and he was overlooked. He\u2019s going to feel bad.\nSheldon: But it wasn\u2019t my fault. I didn\u2019t exclude him. And I didn\u2019t write the article.\nAmy: Remember that time you didn\u2019t get picked to pull the sword out of the stone at Disneyland and they let that other kid do it?\nSheldon: Oh, that kid. Poor Leonard.\nAmy: Exactly.\nSheldon: For the record, that kid was a terrible choice. If you cry when you drop your churro, you do not have what it takes to rule England.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: Howard\u2019s car.\nHoward: Thanks for helping us sort through all my mom\u2019s stuff.\nRaj: Of course. I know what it\u2019s like having to go through a loved one\u2019s possessions. My uncle was a worshipper of Krishna. But after he died, you know what we found? A statue of Shiva. It may not be Crips and Bloods, okay? But in India, it\u2019s a thing.\nBernadette: Well, it\u2019ll be good that you\u2019re there. Howard\u2019s been having trouble deciding what to keep and what to let go.\nHoward: Well, it\u2019s hard. A lot of Ma\u2019s stuff brings back fond memories.\nBernadette: Is that why you couldn\u2019t get rid of her drawer full of ketchup packets?\nHoward: Yes. It reminds me of us eating out and her saying quick, nobody\u2019s looking, fill your pockets with ketchup.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Leonard? Have you ever noticed that only my name is on the cable bill?\nLeonard: Yeah.\nSheldon: Good, good. And your name is on the electric bill and mine isn\u2019t. And I\u2019m okay with that.\nLeonard: Actually, your name is on the electric bill.\nSheldon: Oh, right. This is a disaster.\nLeonard: I don\u2019t even know what you\u2019re talking about and I agree.\nSheldon: Okay, I have to tell you something, but you\u2019re not going to like it.\nLeonard: What\u2019s going on?\nSheldon: An article was just published in Scientific American about our theory.\nLeonard: Did they hate it?\nSheldon: No. No, they loved it. They, uh, couldn\u2019t say enough nice things about it.\nLeonard: So what\u2019s the problem?\nSheldon: You know how the PennySaver only has my name\u2026\nLeonard: Sheldon.\nSheldon: They didn\u2019t mention you in the article. Only me.\nLeonard: Really?\nSheldon: I know. It\u2019s not fair. Let the anger go, buddy. You just, you relax all your muscles. Except for your pubococcygeus and anal sphincter. Let\u2019s keep those tight.\nLeonard: Uh, that, that\u2019s not necessary.\nSheldon: It is. They\u2019re what hold back the urine and the faeces. Look, maybe, maybe you shouldn\u2019t read it. It\u2019ll only make you feel worse.\nLeonard: Cooper and his team?\nSheldon: You should know I had nothing to do with that.\nLeonard: Uh, at least they\u2019re talking about the theory. I mean, that\u2019s what\u2019s important.\nSheldon: You know, you\u2019re right. Yeah. You know, it\u2019s like when Stan Lee and Steve Ditko created Spider-Man. Stan Lee may get all the credit, but Steve Ditko knows he was just as important. Even though Stan Lee gets to be in all the Marvel movies. And. and he\u2019s far richer. And he\u2019s a household name, you know? Whereas, you know, you say Ditko, and that sounds like a company that makes Dits.\nLeonard: That\u2019s not helping.\nSheldon: Well, I\u2019d give more examples, but, well, everyone in your position\u2019s so forgettable.\nScene: Mrs Wolowitz\u2019s House.\nHoward: Stuart, we\u2019re here.\nRaj: It\u2019s nice of you to let him keep staying at your mom\u2019s house.\nHoward: Yeah, well, I tried putting him out on the curb, but nobody took him.\nStuart: Hey. Just so you know, the power\u2019s out.\nBernadette: What happened?\nStuart: I called, they said a transformer blew. It\u2019s the whole block. Should be fixed by tomorrow.\nHoward: Wait, when did it go out?\nStuart: In the middle of the night.\nHoward: Oh, my God.\nBernadette: Howie, what\u2019s wrong?\nHoward: It\u2019s all defrosting.\nBernadette: It\u2019s okay. It\u2019s just food.\nHoward: It\u2019s not just food. This is the last food my mother ever made. This is her last brisket. This is her last meatloaf. This is her last. I have no idea what this is, but it\u2019s the last one.\nRaj: Everything okay?\nHoward: No. All Ma\u2019s food is gonna be ruined.\nBernadette: Well, why don\u2019t we take it home and put it in our freezer?\nRaj: You don\u2019t want to do that. Refreezing not only removes moisture, but it creates ice crystals in the fibres of the meat that can compromise its taste and texture. What? I saw a teachable moment. I dropped some culinary science.\nBernadette: What should we do?\nHoward: I\u2019ll tell you exactly what we\u2019re gonna do. We\u2019re gonna eat it.\nBernadette: There\u2019s, like, twenty pounds of food in there.\nHoward: All you said was I had to get rid of things. You didn\u2019t say they couldn\u2019t pass through my colon first.\nBernadette: Howie.\nHoward: Okay. Then how about this? Let\u2019s invite everyone over to dinner. It\u2019ll be like Ma\u2019s feeding us one last time.\nBernadette: I love that.\nRaj: Me, too. Oh, look, we\u2019ve got enough ketchup to cover every ounce of it.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment.\nPenny: I mean, who even reads Scientific American?\nLeonard: It\u2019s kind of a big deal.\nPenny: If it\u2019s such a big deal, how come the biggest celebrity they could get for the cover is a molecule?\nLeonard: Can we please just stop talking about it?\nPenny: I\u2019m sorry. What can I do?\nLeonard: Nothing, I\u2019m fine.\nPenny: No, no. I\u2019m gonna cheer you up. Here we go.\nLeonard: What are we doing?\nPenny: I am taking you shopping.\nLeonard: Oh.\nPenny: My baby is sad, and I\u2019m gonna make him happy again.\nLeonard: Look, I know shopping cheers you up, but it\u2019s just not really my thing.\nPenny: Well, what about this helicopter you control with an iPad?\nLeonard: Does it have a camera in it?\nPenny: It does have a camera in it.\nLeonard: Baby\u2019s listening.\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard? (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard? (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard?\nLeonard: What?\nSheldon: I spoke to the reporter at the magazine.\nLeonard: What happened? Did you tell him it was my idea?\nSheldon: I did.\nLeonard: Thank you. What did he say?\nSheldon: He said they made the editorial decision to only cite the lead scientist.\nLeonard: Why did he think you\u2019re the lead scientist? It was my idea.\nPenny: You know, for an extra four bucks, I can have this thing here tomorrow.\nSheldon: Well, I know it was your idea, but the reporter said he\u2019s been following my work for a while, and the only reason they even mentioned it in the magazine is \u2019cause my name is on it.\nPenny: You know what? I did it. What\u2019s four bucks?\nLeonard: If you\u2019re trying to make me feel better, it\u2019s not working.\nSheldon: Well then what if I told you that I added your name to the cable bill?\nLeonard: No.\nSheldon: Oh. That\u2019s just as well. They had me on hold for 20 minutes and I hung up. (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard? (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard? (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard? Also, Wolowitz invited us all to dinner, so I\u2019m ready whenever you are.\nScene: Amy\u2019s car.\nSheldon: All he had was an idea.\nAmy: Well, that is an important part.\nSheldon: Oh, please. I have ideas all day long. Reverse SeaWorld where dolphins are allowed to pet people. A new clothing size between medium and large called Marge. Snow White retold from the point of view of Sneezy. Why won\u2019t Doc prescribe him something? We finally find out.\nAmy: But Leonard\u2019s idea was good.\nSheldon: Fine. Then Grumpy, what\u2019s he so grumpy about? Maybe his girlfriend won\u2019t take his side.\nScene: Penny\u2019s car.\nLeonard: I\u2019m the one who thought of it.\nPenny: Well, didn\u2019t he do a lot of the work?\nLeonard: Yeah. But now he\u2019s happy to let people think he\u2019s responsible for everything.\nPenny: And that\u2019s why you get an iPad helicopter.\nScene: Amy\u2019s car.\nSheldon: Is it my fault I have a much bigger reputation than he does?\nAmy: It\u2019s not your fault.\nSheldon: Is it my fault that my name came first on the paper alphabetically?\nAmy: Not your fault.\nSheldon: Is it my fault that when the reporter cited me as the lead scientist I didn\u2019t correct him?\nAmy: Hey, look at that pretty bird.\nScene: Penny\u2019s car.\nLeonard: He always needs all the attention. He\u2019s such a baby.\nPenny: I know, I know.\nLeonard: I swear, he is never ever playing with my helicopter.\nScene: Mrs Wolowitz\u2019s kitchen.\nRaj: Okay, I\u2019ll start heating some of this stuff up.\nBernadette: Thanks.\nHoward: Oh, man. This is the boutonniere from my high school prom. A piece of cake from my Bar Mitzvah.\nBernadette: Did she throw anything away?\nHoward: No. If I find my foreskin, I\u2019m gonna kill myself.\nRaj: Okay, so we\u2019ve got, um, three briskets, four meatloafs, one lasagna.\nHoward: No, that\u2019s noodle kugel.\nRaj: One Jewish lasagna, two pound cakes that are about eight pounds each, and one giant container of matzoh ball soup.\nHoward: Ma always kept it on hand, in case I got sick. She thought she could cure anything with her cooking. Even the time I got food poisoning. From her cooking.\nBernadette: You okay?\nHoward: Yeah, I\u2019m okay. Let\u2019s get started.\nRaj: You got it.\nHoward: I\u2019m never gonna talk to her again.\nBernadette: Should we tell everyone not to come?\nHoward: No. I want to do this.\nBernadette: Okay. Well, I\u2019ll keep it together if you can.\nHoward: Okay.\nRaj: I\u2019m not making any promises.\nScene: Mrs Wolowitz\u2019s living room.\nStuart: Glad you guys could make it.\nLeonard: Of course.\nPenny: Wow, it looks really pretty in here.\nStuart: Yeah, turns out half a dozen menorahs really sets a mood.\nLeonard: So, Stuart, have you thought about what you\u2019d do if Howard sells the house?\nStuart: And there goes the mood.\nSheldon: Hi. Hello. Oh, and a special hello to Leonard, who needs to be mentioned by name.\nLeonard: Subtle.\nSheldon: But you got it, right?\nHoward: Hey, guys.\nAll: Hey. Hi. Hello.\nHoward: I just want everyone to know, uh, tonight\u2019s not a sad occasion.\nBernadette: Yeah, we just want to have the kind of dinner that we\u2019ve all had here so many times before.\nHoward: Good food, good friends, and sometime around midnight, heartburn that makes you pray for death.\nAmy: Do you need any help in the kitchen?\nBernadette: No, we got it. You guys make yourselves comfortable.\nPenny: All right, hey, you two, we\u2019re here for Howard right now, okay?\nAmy: Yes, so please behave yourselves.\nLeonard: Fine.\nSheldon: Of course.\nStuart: So I heard you two, uh, wrote a paper together. How\u2019s that going?\nScene: Mrs Wolowitz\u2019s dining room.\nPenny: This food is amazing.\nRaj: Mm, and not a vegetable in sight.\nHoward: That\u2019s not true. We\u2019ve got tomatoes right here.\nAmy: All these bright people sitting around a table by candlelight. Feels like we could be an 18th century French salon.\nSheldon: Indeed. Penny, a salon is a gathering where intellectuals entertained each other with sparkling conversations about issues of the day.\nPenny: Oh, so it\u2019s like The View.\nAmy: Sheldon, The View is a daytime talk show hosted by women.\nSheldon: Oh, I\u2019m aware. It features Whoopi Goldberg. She played Guinan on Star Trek: Next Gen. Penny, Next Gen refers to Star Trek\u2026\nPenny: Shut up.\nRaj: I would like to propose a salon topic.\nAmy: Ooh, please do, Rajesh.\nRaj: The lead in The Hunger Games is a woman. Marvel has made Tor a female.\nPenny: Wait, who\u2019s Tor?\nRaj: You know, Tor, the God of Tunder. As I was saying, is this a sign that our society is approaching gender equality?\nHoward: Certainly a lot more women are reading comic books now.\nStuart: It\u2019s true. At the store, I had to put a seat on the toilet.\nAmy: We won\u2019t know if there\u2019s equality until female Thor has a baby and the Avengers are cool with her pumping breast milk at work.\nHoward: I wonder if only a baby who is worthy can suckle at the bosom of Thor.\nPenny: Okay, new salon topic. Salons, dumb thing from a long time ago or interesting thing made dumb by talking about superheroes? Discuss.\nSheldon: I don\u2019t believe it matters what the topic is. What\u2019s crucial for a salon is that we conduct the discussion in an elevated and insightful way. It\u2019s all about the execution.\nLeonard: Of course you\u2019d focus on that rather than the inspiration. Uh, new salon topic. What\u2019s more important, an idea or its execution?\nBernadette: Oh, that\u2019s fine.\nSheldon: Yeah, good for you, Leonard. That\u2019s a lovely little notion. Kind of like, I wish I could talk to my uncle in Chicago. Yeah, now stand back while I invent the telephone. Hello? Oh, hold on. Leonard, it\u2019s your uncle. He says you just got burned.\nAmy: Sheldon.\nPenny: Guys.\nLeonard: No, it\u2019s okay. We\u2019re all adults trying to have an intelligent discussion. At least I am. Howard, what do you think?\nHoward: Well, I guess, as an engineer, I lean towards execution. I spend my days trying to take ideas and make them real.\nSheldon: Well said, old chap. I thought eloquence had died, here it stands before us. Starting today, it\u2019ll go Gettysburg Address, I have a dream, and what he just said.\nLeonard: Oh, now he\u2019s a genius? All you ever do is make fun of him and engineering.\nSheldon: Leonard, please. His mother just died.\nLeonard: You\u2019re being ridiculous.\nSheldon: Yeah, so are you.\nPenny: Guys, if I wanted to hear people be bitchy, I\u2019d go to my real salon.\nSheldon: Leonard, lots of people could\u2019ve had that idea, but very few people could\u2019ve worked out the math the way I did.\nLeonard: Lots of people also didn\u2019t have that idea, like everyone in the entire world except for me.\nSheldon: Oh, well, apparently Leonard thinks he\u2019s better than everyone in the whole world, including those fighting for our freedom. Yeah, well, I don\u2019t know about you, but I support our boys overseas.\nAmy: And girls.\nSheldon: Hey, you already ruined Thor, give it a rest.\nLeonard: So I\u2019m just supposed to be okay with you hogging all the credit?\nSheldon: I didn\u2019t hog anything. Unlike you and that weird lasagna with raisins in it.\nLeonard: You want some of this? I\u2019ll give you some.\nBernadette: Hey. Sheldon, Leonard, living room, right now!\nSheldon: She said my name first, that must kill you.\nBernadette (off): I don\u2019t know what you think you\u2019re doing, but this is a very difficult time for my husband. We\u2019re eating the last food his mother ever made, and you were gonna throw it at each other like children? Whatever it is you\u2019re fighting about, put it aside, go back in there and be a good friend to Howard or there\u2019s no dessert for either of you. Look at me when I\u2019m talking to you. And don\u2019t think\u2026\nHoward: You guys ever notice sometimes Bernadette sounds like my mom?\nAmy: I don\u2019t hear it.\nRaj: No, not at all.\nScene: Mrs Wolowitz\u2019s living room.\nPenny: I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve eaten that much in my entire life.\nHoward: It\u2019s why my people wandered the desert for 40 years. Took that long to walk it off.\nSheldon: You see, Penny, the Israelites were in the desert\u2026\nPenny: Shut up.\nRa: So glad you two are done fighting.\nLeonard: Right now, I\u2019m just trying to burp without throwing up.\nSheldon: Hang on. Physics Today mentioned the paper.\nStuart: What\u2019d they say?\nAmy: Who cares? Did they mention Leonard?\nSheldon: They did.\nAll: Yay.\nBernadette: Good news, I found more Tums.\nAll: Yay.\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "1_8": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The apartment. \nSheldon: Oh look, Saturn 3 is on.\nRaj: I don\u2019t want to watch Saturn 3. Deep Space Nine is better.\nSheldon: How is Deep Space Nine better than Saturn 3?\nRaj: Simple subtraction will tell you it\u2019s six better.\nLeonard: Compromise. Watch Babylon 5.\nSheldon: In what sense is that a compromise?\nLeonard: Well, five is partway between three\u2026 Never mind.\nRaj: I\u2019ll tell you what, how about we go rock-paper-scissors?\nSheldon: Ooh, I don\u2019t think so. No, anecdotal evidence suggests that in the game of rock-paper-scissors, players familiar with each other will tie 75 to 80% of the time due to the limited number of outcomes. I suggest rock-paper-scissors- lizard-Spock.\nRaj: What?\nSheldon: It\u2019s very simple. Look, scissors cuts paper. Paper covers rock. Rock crushes lizard. Lizard poisons Spock. Spock smashes scissors. Scissors decapitates lizard. Lizard eats paper. Paper disproves Spock. Spock vaporizes rock. And as it always has, rock crushes scissors.\nRaj: Okay, I think I got it. (They prepare)\nTogether: Rock-paper-scissors- lizard-Spock! (Both hold up the symbol for Spock) Oh!\nHoward (entering, wearing an eye patch): Hello, boys.\nLeonard: Ahoy, matey.\nHoward: Noticed the eye patch, did you? It\u2019s all part of a technique I\u2019ve been studying for picking up women. You employ a visual display designed to make yourself distinctive and memorable.\nSheldon: Oh yes, like the male peacock with brilliant plumage or the rutting baboon with engorged hindquarters.\nLeonard: Or in this case, the bar mitzvah boy with pinkeye.\nHoward: Mock me if you will, but it works. You show up at a club in something distinctive, scope out your target and toss out some negs.\nRaj: What are negs?\nHoward: A neg is a negative compliment that throws a pretty woman off her game, like \u201cNormally, I\u2019m not turned on by big teeth, but on you, they work.\u201d I\u2019ve got a whole list of \u2019em. Who wants to be my wingman?\nLeonard: You\u2019re not gonna need wingman, you\u2019re gonna need a paramedic.\nPenny (entering): Howard, your scooter\u2019s blocking my car. Aw, did you get pinkeye again?\nHoward: Step one, she notices the eye patch. May I say, Penny, not a lot of women could look as hot as you do with such greasy hair? (She reaches out, pulls his eye patch away from his face, then lets go allowing the elastic to spring it back into place.)\nPenny: Yeah, just move your stupid scooter before I pick it up and throw it in the dumpster.\nHoward: Ow.\nCredits sequence. \n\u00a0\nScene: The same.\nSheldon: I\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019m not going to watch the Clone Wars TV series until I\u2019ve seen the Clone Wars movie. I prefer to let George Lucas disappoint me in the order he intended.\nLeonard: Well, I want to watch it now.\nSheldon: Then I believe we\u2019ve arrived at another quintessential rock-paper-scissors- lizard-Spock moment.\nLeonard: Watch whatever you want.\nRaj: I saw what you did there.\nSheldon: What did I do?\nLeonard (answering phone): Hello. Hey, Howard. What\u2019s wrong? Okay. Okay, we\u2019ll be right there.\nSheldon: What happened?\nLeonard: Howard\u2019s at the Mars Rover lab. He says he\u2019s in trouble. Defcon 5.\nSheldon: Defcon 5? Well, there\u2019s no need to rush.\nLeonard: What?\nSheldon: Defcon 5 means no danger. Defcon 1 is a crisis.\nLeonard: How can 5 not be worse than 1?\nRaj: Yeah, Star Trek V, worse than I.\nSheldon: Okay, first of all, that\u2019s a comparison of quality, not intensity. Secondly, Star Trek I is orders-of-magnitude worse than Star Trek V.\nRaj: Are you joking? Star Trek V is the standard against which all badness is measured.\nSheldon: No, no, no. Star Trek V has specific failures in writing and direction, while Star Trek I fails across the board, art direction, costuming, music, sound editing.\nLeonard: Can we just forget I said Defcon and go?\nRaj: Star Trek V!\nScene: A corridor at the university\n\u00a0\nSheldon: All right, will you at least stipulate that Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home is inarguably the best?\nRaj: I have three words for you. Wrath of Khan.\nHoward: Oh, thank God, you\u2019re here.\nLeonard: What\u2019s the emergency?\nHoward: I got the Mars Rover stuck in a ditch.\nSheldon: Where?\nHoward: On a dusty highway just outside Bakersfield. Where do you think? On Mars!\nWoman (peering out of door): Howard, is everything okay?\nHoward: Yeah, baby, I\u2019ll be right in.\nSheldon: You brought a girl to the Mars Rover control room?\nHoward: Yeah, I picked her up in the bar. She\u2019s a doctor. One free barium enema and my mother won\u2019t care she\u2019s not Jewish.\nLeonard: Wait a minute, so the eye patch and the insults worked?\nHoward: No, there were three other guys with eye patches, iIt was a fiasco. What did work was, \u201cHow\u2019d you like to visit a secret government facility?\u201d\nSheldon: So what exactly do you want us to do?\nHoward: I need you and Raj to help me get the Rover out of the ditch, and I need you to get Stephanie out before somebody notices she\u2019s here. She doesn\u2019t exactly have clearance.\nSheldon: Really? They don\u2019t let strange women from honky-tonks come in and play with $200million government projects on distant planets?\nHoward: Yes, I was bad. Maybe she\u2019ll spank me. Can we please move on?\nGirl: Hey, Howard, you know, it\u2019s getting late, so do I get to drive this thing or what?\nHoward: Yeah. No. I\u2019m sorry, but something\u2019s come up. Kind of a Mars Rover, Mars Rover, can Howard come over, situation. So my friend Leonard is gonna take you home.\nGirl: Oh, okay. Let\u2019s go, friend Leonard.\nLeonard: Okay.\nHoward: I\u2019ll call ya.\nGirl: Yeah. So are you a scientist like Howard?\nLeonard: No one\u2019s a scientist like Howard.\nHoward: My mother is so gonna love her.\nSheldon: Oh, how nice. Maybe they can carpool when they visit you in federal prison.\nScene: Leonard\u2019s car. Leonard and the girl are kissing.\nGirl: I\u2019m sorry. I totally interrupted you. What, what, what were you saying?\nLeonard: Just said Howard\u2019s a terrific guy. He\u2019s got a great sense of humour, he loves his mother, a lot, some people say too much.\nGirl: I really like that you\u2019re such a loyal friend.\nLeonard: Yeah, I am loyal. You know, if you look at the big picture. Just, out of curiosity, did he ever have a shot with you?\nGirl: Are you insane? The guy was wearing an eye patch.\nLeonard: Then why did you?\nGirl: He said that I could drive a car on Mars.\nLeonard: Got it. So, can I see you again?\nGirl: You\u2019re not gonna see me now.\nLeonard: Ooh. Cool.\nScene: The Mars Rover control room.\n\u00a0\nHoward: Anything?\nRaj: Actually, I was just checking my e-mail. But, uh, no, the Rover is not responding.\nSheldon: I believe the appropriate metaphor here involves a river of excrement and a Native American water vessel without any means of propulsion.\nHoward: Hang on, there\u2019s got to be other options.\nRaj: You could try calling Triple-A, but based on NASA\u2019s latest timetable, they won\u2019t get there for 35 years.\nSheldon: Plus I understand you have to be standing next to the vehicle with your card when they arrive.\nRaj: Oh, snap.\nSheldon: Snap what?\nHoward: OK, I guess we have to turn to Plan B.\nRaj: What\u2019s Plan B?\nHoward: Erase all the hard drives, scrap the surveillance tapes, wipe our fingerprints off every surface and run.\nSheldon: Why wasn\u2019t that Plan A?\nScene: The apartment.\n\u00a0\nVoice from television: REPORTER: A NASA spokesman states that due to the loss of data, they will most likely be unable to determine the cause of the Mars Rover\u2019s malfunction. This is not the first time an exploratory mission to Mars has ended in disappointment.\nHoward: Thank God for Plan B.\nPenny: Howard, didn\u2019t you say you worked on the Mars Rover?\nHoward: No, you\u2019re mistaken.\nPenny: Yeah, when we first met, you said that if I went out with you, I could drive a car on Mars.\nHoward: I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\nLeonard: Psst! Psst!\nSheldon: Will you all excuse me? Leonard is subtly signalling that he\u2019d like to talk to me in private.\nPenny: No. Yeah, I remember specifically. You started by asking if I was from Mars because my ass was out of this world.\nHoward: Well, that does sound like me, but no.\nSheldon: Is there some problem?\nLeonard: Yeah. Listen, I have to kinda sneak out for a while.\nSheldon: All right, goodbye.\nLeonard: No, wait! If anyone asks you where I went, you don\u2019t know.\nSheldon: Where are you going?\nLeonard: I can\u2019t tell you that.\nSheldon: Who would ask me?\nLeonard: I can\u2019t tell you that, either.\nSheldon: So you brought me in here to inform me that you can\u2019t tell me where you\u2019re going and you can\u2019t tell me who might ask?\nLeonard: Yeah, I really didn\u2019t think this through.\nSheldon: Leonard, a moment.\nLeonard: What?\nSheldon: If someone, and of course, we don\u2019t know who this would be, does ask where you\u2019ve gone, what should I say?\nLeonard: I don\u2019t know. Just tell them I went to the office.\nSheldon: Are you going to the office?\nLeonard: No.\nSheldon: Then how can I say it convincingly?\nLeonard: Just say, Leonard went to the office.\nSheldon: All right. Leonard went to (exaggerated) the office.\nLeonard: What is? No, not like that! Just, Leonard went to the office.\nSheldon: This would have worked out a lot better if you\u2019d just told me you were going the office.\nLeonard: I\u2019m going to the office.\nSheldon: See? Why don\u2019t I believe you?\nLeonard: I\u2019m going out for a while.\nHoward: Okay.\nSheldon: Doesn\u2019t anyone want to know where he\u2019s going?\nPenny: Okay, where is he going?\nSheldon: Leonard is going to (exaggerated) the office.\nScene: The girl\u2019s apartment.\nLeonard: So how was work today?\nGirl: Busy. I removed an appendix, a gall bladder and about a foot and a half of bowel.\nLeonard: I\u2019m hoping that\u2019s three different guys.\nGirl: No, just the one. He didn\u2019t make it. So, how was your day?\nLeonard: Oh, you know, I\u2019m a physicist, so, I thought about stuff.\nGirl: That\u2019s it?\nLeonard: Well, I wrote some of it down.\nGirl: Are you done eating?\nLeonard: Uh, yeah.\nGirl: Oh, good.

It\u2019s Howard.\nScene: The laundry room\nPenny: Oh, hey.\nLeonard: Hey.\nPenny: New shirts?\nLeonard: Yeah, a couple.\nPenny: Nice.\nLeonard: \u00a0Thank you.\nPenny: So, who\u2019s the girl?\nLeonard: I\u2019m sorry?\nPenny: Well, last time you bought a new shirt was when we were dating.\nLeonard: So, uh, what we did was in fact dating?\nPenny: Well, yeah, we did have a date.\nLeonard: Exactly. Thank you. Do me a favour, tell Koothrappali that next time you see him.\nPenny: So, who is she?\nLeonard: Oh, she\u2019s a doctor.\nPenny: Oh, nice. A doctor doctor, or a you kind of doctor?\nLeonard: Doctor doctor. Surgical resident. Smart, pretty. Let me ask you something. If your friend thinks he\u2019s dating someone, but he\u2019s not because, in fact, you\u2019re dating her, does that make you a bad person?\nPenny: Well, that depends.\nLeonard: On what?\nPenny: Is that friend Wolowitz?\nLeonard: Yeah.\nPenny: Screw him. You\u2019re fine.\nLeonard: Are you sure?\nPenny: Well, have you slept with her yet? You dog! Good for you.\nLeonard: Does that change things?\nPenny: No.\nLeonard: So why\u2019d you ask?\nPenny: I\u2019m nosy. See ya.\nScene: Outside Howard\u2019s front door.\n\u00a0\nHoward\u2019s Mother (voice): Howard, get the door!\nHoward (voice): Really? Is that what you do when someone knocks? Thank you. I had no idea! (opening door) Hey, buddy. What brings you to my little slice of hell?\nHoward\u2019s Mother (voice): Who is it?!\nHoward: It\u2019s Leonard!\nHoward\u2019s Mother (voice): You\u2019re gonna have to play outside! I\u2019m not dressed to receive!\nHoward: No one cares, Ma! So, what\u2019s up?\nLeonard: Listen, I need to talk to you about something.\nHoward (his phone rings): Momentito. Yello. Oh, Stephanie, thanks for calling me back. I was worried\u2026 Oh\u2026 Uh-huh\u2026 Uh-huh\u2026 Uh-huh\u2026 No, I understand\u2026 Sure, we can be friends. Absolutely. Thanks for calling. Yeah, you have a nice day, too. (To Leonard) You are dead to me.\nScene: The apartment\n\u00a0\nRaj: Okay, who gets the extra dumpling?\nAll: Rock-paper-scissors- lizard-Spock.\nSheldon: Okay, one of us is going to have to stop putting up Spock.\nHoward: How do we decide that?\nAll: Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock. Oh!\nLeonard: Oh, hey, guys.\nSheldon: Hello.\nRaj: Hey.\nLeonard: Hi, Howard. Howard?\nHoward: Sheldon.\nSheldon: Howard is employing a schoolyard paradigm in which you are, for all intents and purposes, deceased. He intends to act on this by not speaking to you, feigning an inability to hear you when you speak and otherwise refusing to acknowledge your existence.\nLeonard: That\u2019s just ridiculous. Why are you cooperating with him?\nSheldon: I don\u2019t make the rules, Leonard.\nLeonard: Howard, come on, I didn\u2019t plan on this. These things just happen. Usually not to me, but they do happen.\nHoward: Did someone just feel a cold breeze?\nSheldon: I believe this is an extension of the death metaphor. The cold breeze is the so-called ectoplasmic issue of a disembodied soul passing by.\nRaj: You know, screw it, I\u2019m just gonna eat the dumpling.\nLeonard (answering door): Oh, hi, Steph, come on in.\nSteph: \u00a0Is this a bad time?\nLeonard: Yeah, but I don\u2019t see a better one on the horizon, so\u2026\nHoward: Oh, if it isn\u2019t Mrs. Dead to Me.\nSteph: Hello, Howard.\nHoward: Sheldon?\nSheldon: Look I\u2019m sorry, you violated the terms of your metaphor by acknowledging her existence. I\u2019m out.\nLeonard: He just won\u2019t listen to me.\nSteph: Okay, I guess it\u2019ll just be the three of us then.\nLeonard: Hmm. Lisa\u2019s gonna be disappointed.\nSteph: Yeah.\nHoward: Lisa?\nSteph: Yeah, my roommate. She just went through a really bad breakup and I thought she might like to meet somebody fun like you.\nHoward: Leonard, Stephanie, you\u2019re alive, it\u2019s a miracle!\nScene: The apartment kitchen. Howard is on the phone.\n\u00a0\nHoward: So, anyway, Lisa, I just wanted to tell you again how much I enjoyed the other night, and again, I\u2019m sorry for how it ended. But again, if you could let me know about Friday. My mother needs a head count so she can know how big a brisket to get.\nLeonard: Howard, Howard, look at this.\nHoward: Anyway, call me. It\u2019s Howard.\nVoice from TV: The possibility of life on Mars has long fascinated scientists and laypersons alike. It\u2019s unclear how the Mars Rover got into the crevice, but one thing\u2019s certain, the data which it has sent back contain the first clear indications that there may have been life on Mars. It\u2019s a scientific discovery that has staggering implications for all mankind. Unfortunately, we\u2019ll never know who\u2019s responsible.\nHoward: Son of a bitch.\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "4_19": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The apartment\nSheldon: Why hast thou forsaken me, O deity whose existence I doubt?\nPoliceman: Here.

What happened?\nPoliceman: Your friend here called 911 to report a robbery.\nLeonard: Oh, my God, what did they get?\nSheldon: What didn\u2019t they get? They got my enchanted weapons, my vicious gladiator armour, my wand of untainted power, and all my gold.\nLeonard: You called the police because someone hacked your World of Warcraft account?\nSheldon: What choice did I have?

Excuse me, Penny, but Doodle Jump is a game. Angry Birds is a game. World of Warcraft is a massively multi-player online role-playing\u2026 all right, technically it\u2019s a game.\nRaj: Bad news, the Nigerian prince may be a fraud.\nPenny: Okay, well, anyways, I brought you a day-old cheesecake to cheer you up!\nSheldon: Stale pastry is hollow succour to a man who is bereft of ostrich.\nPenny: Just say thank you.\nSheldon: I thought I just did.\nPenny: All right.

Can you believe that?\nBernadette: I feel like I\u2019m supposed to say that bitch, but I don\u2019t have enough information.\nPenny: I am the one who spent two years trying to get him to even go to the beach in the first place. And he was so phobic about stepping on medical waste, I had to carry him to the water.\nBernadette: I took Howard to the beach once. He almost burst into flames like a vampire.\nPenny: So what\u2019s the thanks I get for turning Leonard into quality boyfriend material?

He was either looking up at the ceiling, or down at his shoes.\nAmy: I\u2019m drunk.\nPenny: You know, for the first couple of months, whenever I would take off my bra, he would giggle and say, oh boy, my breast friends.\nBernadette: Well, if it makes you feel any better, I\u2019m never speaking to Priya again.\nPenny: No, don\u2019t do that. No reason to be mean to her.\nAmy: This may be the alcohol talking, but I believe there is. Are you familiar with the recent study of Tanzanian chimpanzees by Nishida and Hosaka out of Kyoto University?\nPenny: No, but I can name all the Kardashians.\nAmy: Primates, such as ourselves, have a natural instinct to ostracize ill-mannered members of the troop. Bernadette\u2019s urge to shun, scowl or fling her waste at Priya is hard-wired into her DNA.\nBernadette: I don\u2019t have an urge to fling my waste.\nAmy: Believe me, it\u2019s there, we all have it. Hit me with some more booze, and I\u2019ll show you.\nScene: The apartment\nHoward: All right, here we are, this is the tavern where all the black-market weapon trades go down.\nRaj: I don\u2019t think my character should be in a place like this. Everyone\u2019s undressing her with their eyes.\nHoward: Maybe if you stop dropping your sword and bending over to pick it up.\nLeonard: Okay, what exactly are we looking for?\nHoward: Redheaded troll, goes by the name of Glumly. According to the message boards, if you want to move stolen goods and it\u2019s after school hours, he\u2019s your guy.\nPriya: Leonard, is this going to take much longer? I thought we were going to spend some time together.\nLeonard: Uh, we are. In the meantime, you\u2019re welcome to whip up a quick character and join us.\nPriya: Seriously?\nLeonard: Well, you have to put in a credit card number, but it\u2019s fun.\nPriya: Maybe I should just go home.\nHoward: Our troll just walked in! I got him!\nLeonard: We got him. We\u2019re almost done.\nHoward: So, how do you guys want to play this?\nSheldon: Be ruthless. You tell him if he doesn\u2019t start talking, we\u2019ll register a complaint with his Internet service provider.\nRaj: Sheldon, what if he gets his Internet from his cable company? He could lose his HBO and all their delightful original programming.\nSheldon: I don\u2019t care! I\u2019m losin\u2019 it, man!\nLeonard: Why don\u2019t we play this smart? Try a little good goblin, bad goblin.\nPriya: Oh, dear Lord.\nHoward: Nah, I think we have to be more subtle.\nRaj: Okay, I see where this is going. Fine, I\u2019ll have sex with him.\nLeonard: That\u2019s not where it was going.\nRaj: Good, because I would hate that.\nPriya: Leonard, you\u2019re busy, let\u2019s talk tomorrow.\nLeonard: Oh, wait. Hang on. Are you upset?\nPriya: No, no, I think it\u2019s sexy to date a boy trapped in a man\u2019s body.\nLeonard: Good, good. I\u2019ll tell you what happens.\nSheldon: And people think I don\u2019t get sarcasm.\nScene: The hallway. \nAmy: Well, well, well. Look who it is.\nPenny: Okay, be nice.\nPriya: Hello.\nPenny: Hi. We\u2019re just heading out for a drink.\nAmy: Because I do that now.\nBernadette: Count your blessings you\u2019re not a Tanzanian chimp.\nPriya: What?\nPenny: Don\u2019t listen to her, she\u2019s had a lot of ice cream. Do you want to join us?\nPriya: Oh, thank you, but I have work to do.\nAmy: Four women walk down the stairs, how many reach the lobby?\nScene: The cafeteria.\nLeonard: Did your sister say anything when you got home last night?\nRaj: Oh, no, don\u2019t put me in the middle of this. I\u2019m not going to be your go-between.\nLeonard: Come on, help me out. Am I in trouble?\nRaj: There\u2019s no reason to worry.\nLeonard: That\u2019s a relief.\nRaj: I\u2019m sure many women in happy relationships spend their nights skyping with their ex-boyfriend Sanjay.\nHoward: Good news, gentlemen, I found our hacker.\nSheldon: What?\nLeonard: Really?\nHoward: Yeah. No one can hide from me, not Waldo, not Carmen San Diego, not even topless Natalie Portman.\nSheldon: I\u2019ve never said these words before, but good job, Howard!\nHoward: Thanks. Our culprit is one Mr. Todd Zarnecki, 2711 Ocean View Road, Carlsbad, California.\nSheldon: The name and the address drip with evil.\nRaj: What else do we know about him?\nHoward: Well, quite a bit, actually.\nLeonard: I\u2019ll bet he\u2019s some loser who lives with his parents.\nHoward: Yes, he does live with his parents. Here\u2019s a Google Earth shot of their house.\nSheldon: Excellent! It\u2019s in a cul-de-sac. We can box him in.\nLeonard: Hold on, you\u2019re thinking of going there?\nSheldon: Carlsbad is only a couple of hours away.\nLeonard: Fine. You walk up to the house, knock on the door and demand your stuff back. What if he says no?\nSheldon: I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve been following the news, Leonard, but there have been some terrific advancements in the field of torture.\nLeonard: No one\u2019s getting tortured.\nSheldon: Fine, we\u2019ll abide by the Geneva Convention. But ask yourself this, in the course of our lives, how much lunch money has been taken from us? How many kites? How many Scooby-Doo Trapper Keepers?\nRaj: I totally had one of those.\nSheldon: Of course you did. It was a fun and practical way of organizing your school work. But the bullies took it from us. Well, no more. Tonight, we take back our dignity, our birthright and our pride. What do you say? Who\u2019s with me?\nRaj: I have a hip-hop aerobics class at five, could we go after?\nSheldon: Sure.\nHoward: Also, tonight\u2019s the Sabbath and my mother and I have a tradition of lighting the candles and\nwatching Wheel of Fortune, so If we could leave at eight, we\u2019d still be able to regain our birthright at ten, ten thirty latest.\nSheldon: Fine. Leonard?\nLeonard: Oh, geez, I don\u2019t know if I can ditch Priya two nights in a row.\nRaj: Oh, come on, man. Bros before\u2026 my sister.\nLeonard: Aw, screw it. I\u2019m in.\nRaj: Me, too.\nHoward: And me.\nSheldon: One moment. (Places a tissue on their hands before adding his own) I\u2019m hell-bent on catching a cyber criminal, not the common cold.\nScene: Howard\u2019s house\nSheldon: I\u2019m sorry, I thought this delay was so you could watch Wheel of Fortune with your mother.\nHoward: I am. She\u2019s just bleaching her moustache. Check it out. Hey, Ma! Before and After! Four words, 17 letters, two N\u2019s, one V.\nHoward\u2019s Mother (off): Fanny pack of wolves.\nLeonard: That\u2019s incredible.\nHoward: Yeah, she\u2019s kind of a Wheel savant.\nLeonard (phone rings): Uh-oh, that\u2019s Priya.\nRaj: Sitar music for her ringtone is not cool, dude.\nLeonard: Hit the\u2026 Hey, sweetie. Yeah, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m gonna be working late. I, I, I miss you, too. Okay, sure, I\u2019ll call you when I get home. Okay, bye-bye.\nRaj: Very nice. You lie to my sister.\nHoward: That\u2019s the nicest thing he does to your sister.\nRaj (phone rings): Oh, guess who.\nLeonard: Cover for me.\nRaj: Hello, Priya. What\u2019s up? How would I know if Leonard\u2019s at work or not? Don\u2019t be suspicious. Look, if you want your relationship with Leonard to continue, you\u2019re going to have to believe whatever wild-eyed, cockamamie excuse the white devil has the nerve to offer you. Okay? Yeah, bye-bye. You owe me.\nHoward: New puzzle, Ma. Same name. One N, two D\u2019s, three O\u2019s.\nHoward\u2019s Mother (off): Whoopi and Rube Goldberg!\nSheldon: That\u2019s uncanny.\nHoward: I know. It\u2019s her superpower. Well, that and jiggling her arm fat.\nScene: Leonard\u2019s car. \nLeonard: I can\u2019t believe we\u2019re going all the way to San Diego to confront this guy.\nHoward: Yeah, we\u2019re kind of bad-asses, aren\u2019t we?\nLeonard: Totally.\nRaj: Hey, how about we stay the night and hit Legoland in the morning?\nSheldon: Sea World is better. It has Shamu, who is literally tons of fun. But for the moment, let\u2019s stay focused on Todd Zarnecki.\nRaj: Yeah, we\u2019re coming for you, Todd Zarnecki. And for the record, Legoland is more interactive.\nSheldon: I almost feel sorry for the poor fool, sitting in his split-level suburban ranch, unaware that a vengeful horde is barrelling down the San Diego Freeway at 71 miles an hour. Ease up there, lead foot. You trying to get us killed?\nRaj: I took the liberty of burning us a mix of heroic questing music.\nSheldon: This says Beyonce Bootylicious Dance Mix.\nRaj: It\u2019s a re-writable CD. Just put it in.\nHoward: Beyonce? Really?\nRaj: She\u2019s curvy and she owns it. I like that.\nLeonard (as Ride of the Valkyries begins): Oh, yeah, I\u2019m feeling it.\nSheldon: We are winged fury! Which is still no excuse for going over the posted speed limit.\nScene: Stuck in a traffic tailback.\nHoward: Next time we go to kick someone\u2019s ass, we take the train.\nSheldon: I always prefer the train.\nScene: Outside Todd Zarnecki\u2019s house.\nLeonard: Sheldon, let\u2019s go.\nSheldon: Coming.\nHoward: Why did you bring that?\nSheldon: No weapon strikes more fear into a man\u2019s heart than a Klingon bat\u2019leth.\nLeonard: Okay, let\u2019s get clear on something. We\u2019re just going to tell this guy to transfer all of your stuff back into your account and then be on our way. No one\u2019s bat\u2019lething anybody.\nSheldon: So my blade shall not taste blood tonight?\nLeonard: No.\nSheldon: Well, now I just feel silly holding it.\nLeonard: Come on.\nSheldon: Can I at least kick down the door?\nLeonard: You\u2019re welcome to try, but the other day, it took you 15 minutes to get into a FedEx box. (Rings bell)\nVoice Inside: Who is it?\nSheldon: Your doom!\nRaj: Don\u2019t say your doom. Who opens the door for their doom?\nSheldon: Good point. Basket of puppies.\nHuge man (opening door): What?\nLeonard: Uh, Sheldon?\nSheldon: Are you Todd Zarnecki?\nTodd: Yeah. Who are you?\nSheldon: I am Sheldor of Azeroth. I want my things back.\nTodd: I don\u2019t think so. Let me see that.\nSheldon: Careful. That\u2019s a collectible.\nTodd: I know. I\u2019ve always wanted one. (Closes door)\nSheldon: Well, he\u2019s even more cunning than we thought.\nScene: Leonard\u2019s car.\nSheldon: You know, the joke\u2019s on him. Without the certificate of authenticity, that bat\u2019leth is worthless.\nHoward: Yeah, he walked right into our trap.\nRaj: Legoland seems like a hollow dream now.\nLeonard: Oh-oh.\nRaj: What\u2019s the matter?\nLeonard: Something\u2019s wrong, I\u2019m not getting any gas. Anybody know anything about internal combustion engines?\nSheldon: Of course.\nRaj: Very basic.\nHoward: 19th-century technology.\nLeonard: Does anybody know how to fix an internal combustion engine?\nSheldon: No.\nHoward: No, not a clue.\nLeonard: Well, we\u2019d better call somebody to come pick us up.\nSheldon: It\u2019d be swell if they had a train.\nScene: Penny\u2019s car.\nSheldon: Thank you, Penny.\nPenny: No problem. So, Leonard, I think it\u2019s interesting you didn\u2019t call your girlfriend to come get you.\nLeonard: Uh, I kind of told her I was working.\nPenny: So you lied to her. Also interesting.\nLeonard: Yeah, she doesn\u2019t really understand the whole Warcraft adventure-role-playing thing.\nPenny: Well, doesn\u2019t matter if she gets it, as long as she\u2019s pretty.\nHoward: This one\u2019s funny, Leonard. How come you couldn\u2019t make it work with her?\nPenny: So did you at least get Sheldon\u2019s fake stuff back?\nSheldon: No. We failed in our noble quest.\nPenny: How come?\nSheldon: Todd Zarnecki was mean.\nPenny: All right. Hang on.\nLeonard: What are you doing?\nPenny: I\u2019m gonna show you how we finish a quest in Nebraska. Oh. Beyonce. (Ride of the Valkyries) This ain\u2019t no Beyonce.\nScene: Todd Zarnecki\u2019s house. Todd answers the door. \nTodd: Now what?\nPenny: Give my friend his stuff back.\nTodd: I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\nPenny: Well, then, good news. Today\u2019s the day a girl\u2019s finally going to touch you in your little special place. (Kicks him in the groin) Now give him his stuff back.\nTodd: Okay.\nSheldon: We did it! I said, we.\nScene: The lobby. \nPriya: Oh, hold the door.\nPenny: Oh, hi.\nPriya: Hi.\nPenny: Going to see Leonard?\nPriya: Yes. How have you been?\nPenny: Fine. You?\nPriya: Very well, thank you.\n(They ascend all three flights of stairs in silence.)\nPenny: Alright, well great seeing you.\nPriya: Yeah, you too.\nPenny: Amy\u2019s right. I do want to fling my poop at her.\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "8_24": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The apartment.\nAmy: Can you believe it\u2019s been five years since our first date?\nSheldon: I know. Do you think I should start watching The Flash TV show?\nAmy: That\u2019s what you\u2019re thinking about?\nSheldon: Well, one of the things.\nAmy: Are any of them me?\nSheldon: Yes. I thought, I can\u2019t decide if I should watch The Flash TV show. I know, I\u2019ll ask Amy. Anyway.\nAmy: What are you doing?\nSheldon: You\u2019re right, you did kind of kill the mood.\nAmy: I didn\u2019t kill anything. You did, talking about your stupid TV show.\nSheldon: Excuse me. Starting to watch a television show that might run for years isn\u2019t a decision to take lightly. I\u2019m wrestling with a big commitment issue here.\nAmy: Really? That\u2019s the commitment issue you\u2019re wrestling with? Sheldon, do you understand the irony of your fixation on a man with super speed, while after five years all I can get out of you is a distracted make-out session on a couch?\nSheldon: Irony\u2019s not really my strong suit. But I have been getting better with sarcasm, if you want to give that a try.\nAmy: Oh, sure, I\u2019d love to.\nSheldon: Whenever you\u2019re ready.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The comic book store.\nStuart: I don\u2019t want to rush you, but I\u2019m closing a little early tonight.\nRaj: Ooh. Hot date?\nStuart: Uh, no. I overheard Bernadette tell Howard she was making him a meat loaf, and you don\u2019t have to not ask me twice.\nEmily: If I stick a light bulb on this, wouldn\u2019t it make a great lamp for my bedroom?\nRaj: You\u2019re kidding, right?\nEmily: Oh. Is this freaking you out?\nRaj: I guess I\u2019m just more of a Pottery Barn, Crate and Barrel kind of guy. Maybe Pier 1 if I really want to cut loose.\nEmily: All right. Never mind.\nRaj: No, no, no. Hey, you should totally get it. In fact, I\u2019ll buy it for you.\nStuart: Sold.\nEmily: Raj, you don\u2019t have to do that.\nStuart: Too late. No returns.\nScene: The stairwell.\nLeonard: That was really intense.\nPenny: Well, now we know, next time we go to the farmers\u2019 market, the order is petting zoo first, then buy vegetables.\nLeonard: Hey.\nSheldon: Oh, good. You\u2019re here. I need your assistance.\nLeonard: Can it wait until I put a Band-Aid on a goat bite?\nSheldon: What happened?\nPenny: Oh, your buddy got mugged by some baby farm animals.\nSheldon: Been there.\nPenny: Mmm. So what do you need help with?\nSheldon: Amy\u2019s mad at me, and I\u2019m not clear why.\nPenny: Okay. Were you talking before she got upset?\nSheldon: Yes.\nPenny: That\u2019s probably it. What\u2019d you say to her?\nSheldon: Well, I just asked her if I should start watching the new Flash TV series.\nPenny: And that made her angry?\nSheldon: Baffling, right? We were necking like a couple of hooligans under the school bleachers. I stopped so I could ask the question. Next thing I know, good-bye, kissy face. Hello, yelly face.\nPenny: Well, Sheldon, when you\u2019re kissing a girl, she expects the attention to be on her.\nSheldon: It was. I asked her if she thought I should watch The Flash.\nPenny: Yeah. I\u2019m tapping out. Leonard?\nLeonard: I\u2019m gonna guess that your main concern is the time commitment of watching an entire season of a new show.\nSheldon: Oh, no, not just a season. If I\u2019m in, I\u2019m in for the whole run, even if the quality declines.\nLeonard: I get it. Smallville almost wrecked you.\nSheldon: Yeah. Exactly. You know, I waited ten years to see a guy everyone knows can fly, fly.\nPenny: Wait, what is wrong with you two? He was talking about television during their date night.\nSheldon: Oh, not just date night, our fifth anniversary.\nPenny: Okay, see, that\u2019s even dumber than you wondering if being bitten by a goat would give you the powers of a goat.\nSheldon: If that happens, don\u2019t make me wait ten years to watch you eat a tin can.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s house.\nRaj: You guys ever notice that Emily has a bit of a twisted side?\nBernadette: You mean \u2019cause she has weird tattoos?\nRaj: No, because she wants to have sex with me in a graveyard.\nHoward: One more time?\nRaj: She and I were supposed to watch the new Avengers movie tonight, but it was sold out. So I said, what else do you want to do? She said, let\u2019s go to a cemetery and do it on somebody\u2019s grave.\nHoward: Like, a random person or somebody she knew?\nRaj: What difference does it make?\nHoward: Well, if it\u2019s her father\u2019s grave and they didn\u2019t get along, then you know she holds a grudge.\nBernadette: The only issue is that everybody has their own thing, and as long as it\u2019s two consenting adults, I guess I don\u2019t see the harm in it.\nRaj: Well, what if it\u2019s one consenting adult and one adult who pretends to consent because he\u2019s afraid of being alone?\nBernadette: Well, then I guess bring a blanket. The grass gets damp at night.\nRaj: I don\u2019t know, guys. Maybe this relationship isn\u2019t for me. Maybe I should break up with her.\nHoward: Right. You\u2019re gonna break up with a girl who has sex with you. Can you believe this guy?\nBernadette: I think if Raj wants to break up with a girl, he can do it.\nHoward: How are you saying that with a straight face?\nBernadette: I don\u2019t know.\nRaj: You guys are being jerks.\nHoward: Buddy, other than Jenny Craig, you\u2019ve never broken up with a girl in your life.\nRaj: You\u2019re one to talk. You\u2019ve been complaining about Stuart living here for the past year. I don\u2019t see you showing him the door.\nHoward: That\u2019s not the same thing. Emily\u2019s a person. Stuart\u2019s more like an infestation, something you spray for.\nRaj: Baloney, okay? You two are as afraid of hurting someone\u2019s feelings as I am.\nBernadette: That\u2019s not true. We were just laughing right in your face.\nScene: The apartment. \nPenny: Thanks for cooking.\nLeonard: Mmm. My pleasure.\nPenny: That carrot was delicious.\nLeonard: Yeah. I wish I\u2019d fought harder for the rest of \u2019em.\nPenny: Still haven\u2019t heard from her?\nSheldon: No, and I\u2019m confused. It\u2019s been nearly 24 hours. Amy should have figured out she\u2019s wrong by now.\nPenny: Hey, I don\u2019t think she\u2019s wrong about you going too slow in the relationship.\nSheldon: Too slow?\nPenny: Yeah, you\u2019ve been going out for years. You haven\u2019t even slept together.\nSheldon: That\u2019s right. It\u2019s called foreplay. And I could make the case that you two aren\u2019t moving forward in your relationship.\nPenny: Uh, hello.\nSheldon: Hello.\nPenny: No. Sheldon, we\u2019re getting married.\nSheldon: But you\u2019ve been engaged for over a year now, and you don\u2019t even have a wedding date.\nPenny: Well, we will. We\u2019re just not in a rush.\nSheldon: Okay.\nLeonard: We\u2019re gonna set a date.\nSheldon: Okay. If you say so.\nPenny: Yeah, it\u2019s just, things are good right now.\nLeonard: Really good.\nPenny: I\u2019m focusing on my job.\nLeonard: And we\u2019ve been busy with our paper.\nPenny: So busy.\nLeonard: Yeah, we\u2019ll pick a date when we pick a date.\nPenny: Yeah.\nSheldon: Okay.\nPenny: You know, I can see why Amy\u2019s mad at you.\nSheldon: Yeah, shut up, Sheldon.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s house.\nBernadette: Did you eat all my yoghurt?\nHoward: You mean the one that makes ladies do the thing that ladies pretend they don\u2019t do even though they do?\nBernadette: You know which yoghurt I mean.\nHoward: I didn\u2019t touch it. Must have been Stuart.\nBernadette: Maybe Raj is right. Maybe it\u2019s time we tell him he needs to move out.\nHoward: We should have done it months ago.\nBernadette: I know, but his store was reopening, and then there were the holidays, and then he was sick.\nHoward: Yeah, right. Sick. He didn\u2019t have jaundice. He just looks like that.\nBernadette: All right. Tonight\u2019s the night.\nHoward: Agreed. When he gets home, I\u2019m dropping the hammer.\nBernadette: Ooh, I like when you take charge.\nHoward: Oh, I\u2019m not taking charge, you\u2019re the hammer.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: So, why haven\u2019t we picked a date?\nPenny: You know why.\nLeonard: Well, of course I know why. But just for fun, why?\nPenny: Not in a rush, busy with work\u2026\nSheldon: Things are good right now.\nPenny: Really good.\nLeonard: You still want to get married, right?\nPenny: Oh, my God. Yes. Why would you even ask that?\nLeonard: I don\u2019t know. Because we don\u2019t have a date?\nPenny: Well, you want a date, pick a date.\nLeonard: It\u2019s not just the date. We haven\u2019t talked about anything. Big wedding, small wedding, indoor, outdoor?\nSheldon: Outdoor? Oh. I can RSVP no right now.\nPenny: Okay, indoor it is. Big or small?\nLeonard: Is your dad paying for it?\nPenny: I doubt it.\nLeonard: Okay, two friends each.\nPenny: All right, well, I want it in a church.\nLeonard: Fine. I want black-tie.\nPenny: Fine. I want to release butterflies.\nSheldon: Seriously? Airborne worms?\nLeonard: Okay. Well, then it\u2019s settled. Small indoor church wedding, black-tie, no butterflies.\nPenny: Sounds perfect.\nLeonard: Great.\nSheldon: You still didn\u2019t pick a date.\nPenny: Stay out of it.\nLeonard: Shut up.\nScene: A graveyard.\nEmily: Mmm. It\u2019s a beautiful night.\nRaj: Oh, yes, we\u2019ve got the moon and the trees and Elizabeth McNulty, who apparently died when she was the same age I am.\nEmily: Makes you feel alive, doesn\u2019t it?\nRaj: So does enjoying a meal at a well-lit restaurant, but here we are.\nEmily: You aren\u2019t scared, are you?\nRaj: Of ghosts, no. Of you, little bit.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: I\u2019m sorry I\u2019ve upset you. I shouldn\u2019t have asked so many questions.\nPenny: No, it\u2019s okay.\nLeonard: Yeah, maybe it\u2019s good you got us talking about this stuff.\nSheldon: Well, look at that, even when I\u2019m causing problems, I make the world a better place. Hey, next, why don\u2019t we tackle your penchant for whining and Penny\u2019s love of the ol\u2019 glug-glug?\nPenny: Uh, Sheldon, I think we\u2019re good for now.\nSheldon: Ah, well, very well. So does this mean you\u2019ll finally pick a wedding date?\nPenny: Here we go again. Why is everyone so concerned with us setting a date? We\u2019re committed to each other. We\u2019re happy. A ceremony isn\u2019t gonna change anything.\nSheldon: So you\u2019re never getting married? It\u2019s his whining, isn\u2019t it?\nLeonard: Sheldon, I\u2019m not a whiner.\nSheldon: It\u2019s amusing that he doesn\u2019t hear it.\nLeonard: Look, all she\u2019s saying is we are in love so it doesn\u2019t matter if we get married tomorrow or a year from now or 50 years from now.\nPenny: Ew, 50? We\u2019ll be old and gross.\nLeonard: Yeah, but we\u2019ll be old and gross together.\nSheldon: My aunt and uncle were married 63 years. Towards the end, it was like watching cheese melt.\nPenny: Um, I\u2019m free tonight.\nLeonard: Are you saying you want to get married?\nPenny: Vegas isn\u2019t that far away.\nLeonard: I\u2019m in. Let\u2019s do it.\nSheldon: After all these years. I\u2019m really happy for the two of you.\nPenny: Oh, thank you.\nLeonard: Thanks.\nSheldon: Now get out of my spot.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s house.\nHoward: Bernie, Stuart just pulled up. So remember, the key is to be firm. Show no weakness.\nBernadette: Right.\nHoward: Good luck.\nBernadette: Howard Joel Wolowitz, you get back here.\nHoward: Never should have told you my middle name.\nStuart: Hey, guys.\nHoward: Hey, you got a minute?\nStuart: Sure. Uh, let me just put this stuff in the fridge. I felt bad for finishing your yoghurt, so I bought more. And, Howard, your favourite fruit is in season. Crunch Berries.\nBernadette: Don\u2019t let that sway you.\nHoward: It\u2019s hard not to. They taste so much better than real berries.\nStuart: What\u2019s up?\nBernadette: So, we need to talk.\nScene: The graveyard.\nEmily: You okay?\nRaj: I think we should talk.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s house.\nStuart: Is everything okay?\nBernadette: Well, you\u2019ve been living here a while now.\nStuart: I know. I may sell comic books at work, but the real superheroes are sitting right in front of me.\nBernadette: Yeah.\nHoward: His middle name is David. Go.\nScene: The graveyard.\nRaj: Look, I care about you a lot, but we are very different people.\nEmily: Are you breaking up with me?\nRaj: No, no, I\u2019m just pointing out that you\u2019re dark on the inside and I\u2019m dark on the outside.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s house.\nBernadette: So, anyway, what I\u2019m trying to say is\u2026 (phone rings)\nHoward: You need to take that?\nStuart: It\u2019s just my dad, probably calling to wish me a happy birthday. I\u2019ll call him back. You were saying?\nScene: The graveyard.\nEmily: Look, Raj, be honest with me. If you want to end things, just do it. Don\u2019t expect me to do it for you.\nRaj: End things? I\u2019m trying to tell you that I love you.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s house.\nHoward and Bernadette (singing): Happy birthday to you.\nScene: Leonard\u2019s car.\nPenny: Wow, there\u2019s a Denny\u2019s in Vegas you can actually get married in.\nLeonard: Doesn\u2019t sound very romantic.\nPenny: Yeah, but we could get heart-shaped pancakes.\nLeonard: I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll find a decent chapel.\nPenny: Yeah. This is crazy.\nLeonard: I know. You think people are gonna be mad?\nPenny: Maybe. But this isn\u2019t about them, it\u2019s about us.\nLeonard: It is. It is about us.\nPenny: And you know what the best part is? We took our time. I mean, we met, we were friends for a couple years, then we got together, and then we got untogether, then we worked out all our problems, and now we know everything about each other, we can just go forward with no surprises and no regrets.\nLeonard: Right. No surprises.\nPenny: And no regrets.\nLeonard: Uh, well, there, there\u2019s one thing I feel I should tell you.\nPenny: What?\nLeonard: You know, so we can go into this with no secrets between us.\nPenny: What?\nLeonard: Remember, uh, a couple years back when I was on that research ship in the North Sea?\nPenny: Yeah.\nLeonard: Okay, well, there, there was a lot of drinking and craziness going on.\nPenny: No, you told me.\nLeonard: Okay, um, well, there was this girl.\nPenny: What did you do?\nLeonard: Nothing really. It was just kissing.\nPenny: And then what?\nLeonard: And then nothing. I stopped it. But it still bothers me, and I wanted you to know.\nPenny: All right.\nLeonard: Did you ever do anything like this since we\u2019ve been?\nPenny: Nope, never.\nLeonard: Oh, that\u2019s too bad.\nPenny: You know, can I ask you a question?\nLeonard: Hmm?\nPenny: Why are you telling me this now?\nLeonard: Well, like I said, we\u2019re about to get married, and I, I want a clean slate. No secrets.\nPenny: Really? Because to me, it seems like we\u2019re about to get married and you\u2019re trying to sabotage it.\nLeonard: Would you rather I didn\u2019t tell you?\nPenny: No, I don\u2019t want there to be secrets between us.\nLeonard: See, now I\u2019m confused. I mean, what, what am I supposed to do?\nPenny: Uh, keep your mouth off other women.\nLeonard: I can do that. Uh, uh, from now on, this mouth, you and food, that\u2019s it.\nPenny: Okay.\nLeonard: Yeah?\nPenny: Look, I\u2019m not happy this happened, but I think I can get past it. I mean, we weren\u2019t engaged at the time, and it was just kissing.\nLeonard: Right.\nPenny: Just kissing.\nLeonard: It wasn\u2019t even very good. She was a smoker, I\u2019d just been seasick.\nPenny: Okay, that\u2019s enough. Stop talking.\nLeonard: So, we\u2019re still getting married?\nPenny: Yes.\nLeonard: Because we love each other.\nPenny: Yes.\nLeonard: And it\u2019s the happiest day of our lives.\nPenny: Ha-ha, don\u2019t push it.\nScene: The apartment. \nAmy (on skype): Hello.\nSheldon: Hello. Listen, I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about relationships and how difficult they can be, and I think\u2026\nAmy: I\u2019ve been thinking about them, too, Sheldon. Being your girlfriend is so challenging. Emotionally, physically. I\u2019ve been incredibly patient for years.\nSheldon: Strongly disagree. Go on.\nAmy: Okay, well, this isn\u2019t easy to say, because I love you, but I need some time to take a step back and re-evaluate our situation.\nSheldon: Oh.\nAmy: I hope you understand.\nSheldon: Okay.\nAmy: Bye, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Well, Gollum, you\u2019re an expert on rings. What do I do with this one?\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "3_15": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The university cafeteria.\nHoward (on the phone): Yeah, I miss you, too, sweetie. Listen, I got to go, but I\u2019ll see you tonight? Okay. Bye-bye. Yeah, bye-bye. No, you hang up first. Hello?\nRaj: Dude, I\u2019m glad you finally got a girlfriend, but do you have to do all that lovey-dovey stuff in front of those of us who don\u2019t?\nSheldon: Actually, he might have to. There\u2019s an economic concept known as a positional good in which an object is only valued by the possessor because it\u2019s not possessed by others. The term was coined in 1976 by economist Fred Hirsch to replace the more colloquial, but less precise neener-neener.\nHoward: That\u2019s not true. My happiness is not dependent on my best friend being miserable and alone.\nRaj: Thank you.\nHoward: Although, I\u2019d be lying if I said it wasn\u2019t a little bit of a perk.\nLeonard: Who\u2019s miserable and alone?\nRaj: Me.\nLeonard: Oh. I used to be like that. Then I got a girlfriend.\nSheldon: In pre-1976 terms, neener-neener.\nLeonard: Hey, what are you and Bernadette doing for your first Valentine\u2019s Day?\nHoward: Yeah, I am pulling out all the stops. There\u2019s a $39.95 lover\u2019s special at P.F. Chang\u2019s. Egg rolls, dumplings, bottomless wok, and you get your picture taken on the big marble horse out front.\nSheldon: Given that Saint Valentine was a third century Roman priest who was stoned and beheaded, wouldn\u2019t a more appropriate celebration of the evening be taking one\u2019s steady gal to witness a brutal murder?\nHoward: I understand your point, but given a choice, Jews always go with Chinese food.\nRaj: Well, if anyone\u2019s interested, I\u2019ll be spending this Valentine\u2019s Day the same way I spend every Valentine\u2019s Day. Buying a rotisserie chicken from the supermarket, taking it home, standing over the sink and eating it out of the package with my bare hands like an animal.\nLeonard: Okay, so to sum up: one giant marble horse, one asinine comment, one lonely man and his chicken. And let\u2019s see, who\u2019s left? Oh, that\u2019s right. My plans. Isn\u2019t anyone going to ask?\nRaj: Fine, tell us you\u2019re going to have sex with Penny.\nLeonard: That\u2019s not what I was going to tell you.\nRaj: It\u2019s okay. I don\u2019t mind hearing about your sex life. It\u2019s his that bugs me.\nLeonard: Guess who the university is sending to Switzerland to attend a conference and see the CERN supercollider on February 14?\nSheldon: Professor Norton, although, God knows why. He hasn\u2019t published anything of note since he won that Nobel Prize.\nLeonard: Actually, Professor Norton can\u2019t make it. He threw his back out rock climbing.\nHoward: I heard he threw his back out climbing on his new girlfriend.\nRaj: The big-boobed weather girl on Channel 2?\nHoward: That\u2019s the one.\nLeonard: In any case, they\u2019re asking me to fill in for him.\nSheldon: In Switzerland or with the big-boobed weather girl?\nLeonard: Switzerland. And I get to bring a guest!\nHoward: Oh, man!\nRaj: No way, dude!\nSheldon: This is incredible! I\u2019m so happy, I\u2019m not even going to question their judgment in picking you. I\u2019m just going to run home and start packing.\nRaj: Why wouldn\u2019t you take Penny?\nLeonard: I am taking Penny.\nRaj: Oh. Well, then I anticipate an awkward situation when you get home.\nCredits sequence. \nScene: Sheldon\u2019s bedroom. \nLeonard: Sheldon, you got a minute?\nSheldon: Of course, my good friend. Come in. Help me out, which ski hat says apr\u00e8s supercollider?\nLeonard: Sheldon, I\u2019m not taking you to Switzerland.\nSheldon: Well, of course you are. Who else would you take?\nLeonard: Penny.\nSheldon: What? That\u2019s absurd. Penny has no interest in subatomic particle research.\nLeonard: Yes, but it\u2019ll be Valentine\u2019s Day. We can go sightseeing and skiing and make love in front of a roaring fire in the shadow of the snowcapped Alps.\nSheldon: But Penny has no interest in subatomic particle research.\nLeonard: I\u2019m sorry, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Sorry? I\u2019ve been dreaming about going to the Large Hadron Collider since I was nine years old.\nLeonard: Yeah, well, I\u2019ve been dreaming about spending Valentine\u2019s Day with a girl since I was six.\nSheldon: Shame on you! That\u2019s no dream for a scientist!\nScene: The apartment.\nPenny: Okay, what\u2019s the big surprise?\nLeonard: Just a minute. This tray contains clues as to what you and I are going to be doing on Valentine\u2019s Day.\nPenny: Oh. Wow. Okay. Let\u2019s see. We\u2019ve got, uh, milk chocolate, Swiss cheese, fondue. My lactose-intolerant boyfriend is going to eat all this, then I\u2019m going to climb on his back and rocket to the moon?\nLeonard: No. But it does involve air travel. Okay, um, let me slice this Swiss cheese with my Swiss army knife, and then you can wash it down with a cup of Swiss Miss instant cocoa.\nPenny: Okay, I\u2019m starting to think Swiss is key here.\nLeonard: Uh-huh.\nPenny: We\u2019re going to Disneyland and ride the Matterhorn?\nLeonard: How does that involve air travel?\nPenny: We\u2019re going to Disney World and ride the Matterhorn?\nLeonard: No.\nPenny: Okay, sweetie, this started out fun, but I\u2019m over it.\nLeonard: We\u2019re going to Switzerland to see the CERN supercollider! And ski. We\u2019ll also go skiing.\nPenny: We\u2019re going skiing in Switzerland?!\nLeonard: Well, you\u2019ll ski, I\u2019ll fall, but, yeah, we will be in Switzerland for Valentine\u2019s Day.\nPenny: Oh, my God, Leonard! That\u2019s incredible!\nSheldon: Not so fast. You might want to hold off on lighting your rabeliechtli, Penny.\nPenny: My Rabe-what-ly?\nSheldon: Rabeliechtli. It means turnip light and refers to a traditional lantern hand-carved from a root vegetable and used to celebrate certain Swiss festivals. Which you will not be celebrating because, A, these festivals occur in the fall, and B, you will not be going to Switzerland.\nLeonard: Sheldon, we\u2019ve been through this. I\u2019m taking Penny.\nSheldon: Afraid not. Do you recognize this?\nLeonard: Not the roommate agreement.\nSheldon: Indeed, the roommate agreement. I call your attention to the Friendship Rider in Appendix C, Future Commitments. Number 37, in the event one friend is ever invited to visit the Large Hadron Collider, now under construction in Switzerland, he shall invite the other friend to accompany him.\nLeonard: Oh, for God\u2019s sakes.\nPenny: You actually put that in an agreement?\nLeonard: Yeah. We also put in what happens if one of us wins a MacArthur Grant, or if one of us gets superpowers, or if one of us is bitten by a zombie.\nSheldon: He can\u2019t kill me, even if I turn.\nPenny: Is there anything in there about if one of you gets a girlfriend?\nSheldon: No, that seemed a little farfetched.\nLeonard: Sheldon, do you really expect to enforce this?\nSheldon: I\u2019ve lived up to all my commitments under the agreement. At least once a day I ask how you are, even though I simply don\u2019t care. I no longer stage spontaneous biohazard drills after 10 pm And I abandoned my goal to master Tuvan throat singing.\nPenny: Okay, I know I shouldn\u2019t ask, but what is\u2026?\nLeonard: No.\nSheldon (after demonstrating): I\u2019d be much further along if I\u2019d been allowed to practice.\nLeonard: Look, Sheldon, I know it\u2019s in the agreement, and if you turn into a zombie, I promise I will not kill you. In fact, I\u2019ll even let you eat my brains. But I am taking Penny to Switzerland.\nSheldon: Is that your final decision?\nLeonard: It is.\nSheldon: Very well.\nPenny: It\u2019s not over, is it?\nLeonard: What do you think? (The sound of Tuvan throat singing comes from Sheldon\u2019s bedroom.)\n \nScene: Leonard\u2019s car.\nLeonard: Got a bit of traffic this morning, huh? Think it\u2019s gonna rain? Instead of underpants, I covered my crotch with potato salad this morning. Thoughts? Okay, I know what\u2019ll cheer you up, let\u2019s play one of your driving games.\nSheldon: All right. This game is called Traitors. I will name three historical figures, you put them in order of the heinousness of their betrayal. Benedict Arnold, Judas, Dr. Leonard Hofstadter.\nLeonard: You really think I belong with Benedict Arnold and Judas?\nSheldon: You\u2019re right. Judas had the decency to hang himself after what he did.\nLeonard: Come on, Sheldon. Can\u2019t you at least try to understand how much this means to me?\nSheldon: Round two, Leonard Hofstadter, Darth Vader, Rupert Murdoch.\nLeonard: Rupert Murdoch?\nSheldon: He owns Fox, and they cancelled Firefly. Hint, he and Darth Vader are tied for number 2.\nScene: The university cafeteria. \nHoward: I\u2019m sorry I couldn\u2019t hang with you last night. I had a date with Bernadette.\nRaj: I know. I saw the Tweet.\nHoward: So, what did you end up doing?\nRaj: Not much. Nuked a burrito. Prayed to the Hindu god Urvashi that your bowels would loosen and your penis would droop like a willow tree.\nLeonard: You seen Sheldon?\nRaj: No. Is he still mad about the supercollider?\nLeonard: Yeah. He thinks I betrayed him. I mean, come on, what would you guys do if you were me?\nHoward: I\u2019d take Sheldon to Switzerland.\nLeonard: Seriously?\nHoward: Absolutely. And I\u2019d leave him there. (Sheldon enters, puts a tray in front of Leonard, and exits.)\nRaj: What the hell is that?\nLeonard: Uh, let\u2019s see. Yup, 30 pieces of silverware.\nScene: Leonard\u2019s bedroom.\nSheldon: Morning, old chum.\nLeonard: What\u2019s going on?\nSheldon: I\u2019ve made you breakfast. Juice, coffee, and pancakes in the shape of some of your favorite fictional characters. See, here\u2019s Frodo.\nLeonard: You made Frodo pancakes?\nSheldon: Yeah, I used coconut shavings to do the hair on his feet. If you need to void your bladder before eating, I can keep them warm with this beret that I thoroughly laundered and pressed into service as a pancake cosy.\nLeonard: Why are you doing this?\nSheldon: It\u2019s by way of an apology for my recent behaviour. I\u2019ve had some time to reflect and I\u2019ve come to realize that friendship is not an aggregation of written agreements. It\u2019s a result of two people respecting and caring for each other. Butterscotch scone?\nLeonard: Thanks. It\u2019s good.\nSheldon: What you\u2019re tasting is respect and affection. And about a pound of Crisco. After you\u2019ve finished breakfast, I thought we could spend the day watching the final season of Babylon 5 with director commentary.\nLeonard: You hate Babylon 5.\nSheldon: I do. It fails as drama, science fiction, and it\u2019s hopelessly derivative. But you like it, and you\u2019re my friend.\nLeonard: Okay, great. Still not taking you to Switzerland.\nSheldon: Drat. No Frodo for you.\nScene: The laundry room.\nSheldon: Hello.\nPenny: Hello.\nSheldon: Alright, let\u2019s dispense with the friendly banter, I believe you know why I\u2019m here.\nPenny: Well, I always figured it was to study us, discover our weaknesses, and report back to your alien overlords.\nSheldon: Yes, amusing. Extraordinary intelligence might well appear extraterrestrial to you, but let me be more specific. I believe you know why I\u2019m here in the laundry room.\nPenny: Better acoustics for your throat singing?\nSheldon (trying it): It\u2019s actually not bad. But my true purpose in being here will be revealed in this brief PowerPoint presentation. Lights. Why Sheldon Cooper, PhD, should go to Switzerland to see the CERN supercollider. A PowerPoint presentation by Sheldon Cooper, PhD.\nPenny: Oh, for God\u2019s sakes.\nSheldon: Here we have a highly gifted researcher in the field of particle physics whose work has brought him to the precipice of forever changing mankind\u2019s understanding of the universe. AKA me. And here we have a waitress brushing her teeth with her finger. AKA you.\nPenny: I\u2019m sorry. Is this supposed to be buttering me up?\nSheldon: Please hold all questions to the end of the presentation. This is the Large Hadron Collider at CERN in Switzerland, the product of decades of planning and construction. It is a Mecca for physicists the world over. This is Bath and Body Works on Colorado Boulevard. They sell scented soaps and lotions, some of which contain glitter. Now, let\u2019s see if we can match the individual to the appropriate destination.\nPenny: Okay, show\u2019s over.\nSheldon: No, it\u2019s not. I\u2019ve got five more slides.\nPenny: Sheldon, this is Leonard\u2019s decision. He invited me to Switzerland, and I intend to go.\nSheldon: Very well. Enjoy yourself. You\u2019re going to be in the presence of something that I\u2019ve dreamed of seeing for decades. I just hope you\u2019ll be able to appreciate the magnitude of where you are and what it represents.\nPenny: I\u2019ll talk to Leonard.\nSheldon: You will?\nPenny: Yes. If it means that much to you, you should go.\nSheldon (Hugging her): Oh, Penny, thank you!\nPenny: You\u2019re welcome.\nSheldon: Since I rarely hug, I\u2019m relying on your expertise regarding duration.\nPenny: I think we\u2019re there.\nSheldon: Oh, good. Bye-bye.\nScene: The apartment.\nRaj: You know what? Even though I don\u2019t have a girlfriend, I can still have a good time on Valentine\u2019s Day.\nHoward: Trust me, you can\u2019t. I\u2019ve tried.\nRaj: No, no, no, I\u2019m going to have a me day. First I\u2019m going to go to one of those spas in Koreatown, take a steam and get a massage. Then I\u2019m going to stop at a pet store and get licked by puppies.\nLeonard: Sheldon, I need to talk to you.\nSheldon: All right, my friend. Would you like some cholermus?\nLeonard: Some what?\nSheldon: Cholermus. It\u2019s a traditional Swiss breakfast dish. I\u2019m preparing my gastrointestinal system for the exotic cuisine of Switzerland.\nLeonard: You\u2019re not going to Switzerland!\nSheldon: Oh, but I am. Didn\u2019t Penny tell you the good news?\nLeonard: She told me that you went behind my back to guilt her into letting you go instead of her.\nSheldon: Yes, that good news.\nLeonard: Well, forget it. I was the one who was invited, I get to decide who goes with me, and it\u2019s Penny, not you!\nSheldon: Howard, could you lower the lights? I have a short PowerPoint presentation.\nLeonard: I don\u2019t need to see your presentation. This discussion is over!\nSheldon: That\u2019s a somewhat ambiguous response. Am I going or not?\nLeonard: Sheldon, at this point, I would go by myself before I would take you.\nSheldon: Really?\nLeonard: Yeah, really.\nSheldon: Well then, you leave me no alternative. From this moment forward, we can be roommates, but we will no longer be friends.\nLeonard: I\u2019m sorry you feel that way.\nSheldon: I don\u2019t think you\u2019re fully aware of the ramifications here, Leonard.\nLeonard: Why don\u2019t you enlighten me?\nSheldon: With the friendship clause of our roommate agreement nullified you are no longer entitled to accompany me to go swimming at Bill Gates\u2019 house should I be invited.\nHoward: Ooh, that\u2019s gotta sting.\nScene: Penny\u2019s bedroom.\nLeonard: Just think, this time tomorrow we\u2019ll be in Geneva, Switzerland for our first Valentine\u2019s Day.\nPenny: I know! I went shopping today and bought special undies for the occasion.\nLeonard: Thermal? \u2018Cause it\u2019s gonna be cold.\nPenny: Think it through, Leonard.\nLeonard: Oh!\nPenny: Oh!\nLeonard (Penny sneezes): Gesundheit. Or as they say in Switzerland, gesundheit. You getting a cold?\nPenny: No, no, it\u2019s probably just allergies.\nLeonard: Do you want an allergy pill? \u2018Cause I have \u2019em all. Prescription, nonprescription, foreign, domestic, experimental.\nPenny: Do any of them work?\nLeonard: Not really, I\u2019m just an enthusiast.\n(Time passes. Sound of Penny retching in the bathroom)\nLeonard: Penny? You okay?\nPenny: Did that sound okay to you? Do not come in here!\nLeonard: What\u2019s going on?\nPenny: I\u2019m having a tea party. What do you think\u2019s going on? I think I might have the flu. Or the plague.\nLeonard: Well, our plane leaves at 9 a.m. Do you think you\u2019ll feel better by then?\nPenny: Yep. \u2018Cause I\u2019m gonna be dead.\nScene: Outside Sheldon\u2019s bedroom.\nLeonard: Hey, Sheldon? Listen, Penny is pretty sick and she\u2019s not going to be able to go to Switzerland. So if you\u2019re still interested, you\u2019re welcome to come. (Sound of Sheldon vomiting in the bathroom)\nSheldon: Great. I\u2019ll start packing. In a minute. (Vomits again) Oh, look, it\u2019s the cholermus.\nScene: The apartment.\n \nPenny: Here\u2019s your soup.\nSheldon: Chicken?\nPenny: Yes.\nSheldon: With the little stars?\nPenny: Yes.\nSheldon: Heated to 180 degrees?\nPenny: Why don\u2019t I pour it in your lap, and you can tell me.\nSheldon: You don\u2019t have to be mean. I\u2019m sick.\nPenny: Yeah, well, I\u2019m sick, too.\nSheldon: Not my problem. I just don\u2019t understand how this happened to me. I\u2019m scrupulous about my hygiene. I regularly disinfect my hands, and I avoid contact with other people on general principle.\nPenny: I don\u2019t know what to tell you, Sheldon.\nSheldon (remembering the hug): It\u2019s you! I touched you!\nPenny: Happy Valentine\u2019s Day.\nScene: A Swiss hotel room. \nRaj: Oh, my goodness, look at this room! Champagne! Roses! Oh, and little chocolates! This is going to be the best Valentine\u2019s Day ever.\nLeonard: Yeah, I forgot about all this.\nRaj: But I never will.\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "2_3": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The apartment. Sheldon is on the sofa, using his laptop. He is wearing a headset.\nSheldon: Fellow warriors, this is Sheldor the Conqueror. We are about to enter Axel\u2019s fortress. Now this is a long run, so let\u2019s do another bladder check. Alright Barry, we\u2019ll wait for you again, but you really should see a doctor. (There is banging at the door.) Sheldor is AFK. (Goes out to find Penny having trouble getting into her apartment.) Penny, are you experiencing some sort of difficulty?\nPenny: Yes, I can\u2019t get my stupid door open.\nSheldon: You appear to have put your car key in the door lock, are you aware of that?\nPenny: Yeah!\nSheldon: Alright then. (Turns to return inside. One of the grocery bags Penny is holding falls to the floor spilling groceries.) \nPenny: Dammit, dammit, dammit, dammit, dammit, dammit.\nSheldon: Would it be possible for you to do this a little more quietly?\nPenny: I can\u2019t get the damned key out.\nSheldon: Well that\u2019s not surprising. That Baldwin lock on your door uses traditional edge mounted cylinders, whereas the key for your Volkswagon uses a centre cylinder system.\nPenny: Thankyou, Sheldon.\nSheldon: You\u2019re welcome. Point of inquiry, why did you put your car key in the door lock?\nPenny: Why? I\u2019ll tell you why. Because today I had an audition, it took me two hours to get there, I waited an hour for my turn, and before I could even start they told me I looked too Midwest for the part. Too Midwest? What the hell does that even mean?\nSheldon: Well, the American Midwest was mostly settled by Scandinavian and Germanic peoples who, well they have a characteristic facial bone structure\u2026.\nPenny: I know what it means, Sheldon! God, you know, I have been in L.A. for almost two years now, and I haven\u2019t got a single acting job, I have accomplished nothing, haven\u2019t gotten a raise at work, haven\u2019t even had sex in six months, and just now when I was walking up those stairs a fly flew in my mouth and I ate it.\nSheldon: Well, actually, insects are a dietary staple in many cultures, they\u2019re almost pure protein.\nPenny (picking up the bag she has just repacked, whereupon the bottom falls out and the groceries fall to the floor again): Oh, sonofabitch!\nSheldon: I believe the condensation on your frozen foods weakened the structural integrity of the bag. But returning to your key conundrum, perhaps you should call a locksmith and have him open the door for you.\nPenny: I did, and he said he\u2019ll get here when he gets here.\nSheldon: And you\u2019re frustrated because he phrased his reply in the form of a meaningless tautology?\nPenny: No! I am frustrated because I am a failure at everything and my breath smells like fly. (Bursts into tears.)\nSheldon: There there. (Reluctantly) Would you prefer to wait in our apartment?\nPenny: No Sheldon, I\u2019d rather sit on this freezing cold floor sobbing like a three year-old.\nSheldon: Alright then. (Turns to go inside again.) \nPenny: For God\u2019s sake! (Stomps into apartment.)\nSheldon: Just when I think I\u2019ve gotten the hang of sarcasm.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: Inside the apartment.\nSheldon: Make yourself comfortable. (Sits in Sheldon\u2019s place.) Not there. (Sits on other end of sofa. Puts feet on table. Sheldon looks disapprovingly. Removes feet from table. Sheldon sits and replaces headset.) Sheldor is back online.\nPenny: Sheldor?\nSheldon: The Conqueror.\nPenny: What are you doing?\nSheldon: AFK. I\u2019m playing Age of Conan, an online multiplayer game set in the universe of Robert E. Howard\u2019s Conan the Barbarian.\nPenny: Oh.\nSheldon: Sheldor, back online.\nPenny: What\u2019s AFK?\nSheldon: AFK. Away from keyboard.\nPenny: OIC.\nSheldon: What does that stand for?\nPenny: Oh, I see?\nSheldon: Yes, but what does it stand for?\nScene: The stairwell. Leonard arrives and sees the spilled groceries. A cat is lapping at a spilled pot of ice-cream. Cut to inside. Penny now has the laptop, Sheldon is instructing her.\nSheldon: Now just click on the enchanted boots to put them on.\nPenny: Oh, I don\u2019t know. Can I see them in another colour?\nSheldon: Just click on them. Congratulations, you are now a level three warrior.\nLeonard: What\u2019s going on?\nPenny: Leonard, guess what, I\u2019m a level three warrior.\nLeonard: Great, you know there are groceries outside of your apartment?\nPenny: Yeah yeah yeah, shhh!\nLeonard: I only bring it up because your ice-cream is melting and it\u2019s starting to attract wildlife.\nPenny: Uh-huh, yeah, do I stay in the jungle or go towards the beach?\nSheldon: It doesn\u2019t matter, right now you\u2019re looking for treasure.\nPenny: Okay. (Leonard motions for Sheldon to talk in the kitchen.) Wait, wait, where are you going?\nSheldon: You\u2019re okay, if you run into crocodiles just kick them with your boots.\nLeonard: Want to catch me up?\nSheldon: Well let\u2019s see, uh, she attempted to open her apartment with her car key, because her face is overly Midwestern, um, she hasn\u2019t had sex in six months, and she ate a fly.\nLeonard: Uh-huh. Seriously, six months?\nPenny: Oh my God, a treasure chest, I\u2019m rich!\nSheldon: Level three and she thinks she\u2019s rich! What a noob.\nScene: The apartment. Raj is pouring a white liquid into the main dish of a stereo speaker covered in cling film.\nRaj: Okay, we\u2019re all set.\nHoward: Let her rip.\n(Leonard turns on stereo with a remote. Rhythmic bass-heavy music plays. The liquid begins dancing on the speaker.) \nPenny (entering, carrying a laptop): Hi!\nLeonard: Hey, check it out, it\u2019s just corn starch and water.\nSheldon: They make up a non-Newtonian fluid which is liquid, but solid under the percussive action of the speaker.\nHoward: That\u2019s what makes it get all funky.\nPenny: Yeah, okay. Listen, I need to talk to Sheldon.\nHoward (after Raj whispers in his ear): No, that\u2019s what she said, Sheldon.\nPenny: Okay, look, I bought the game, and I\u2019ve been exploring the Island of Tordage but I can\u2019t figure out how to get past the guard captain.\nSheldon: Do you have the enchanted sword?\nPenny: No, no, I\u2019ve a bronze dagger.\nSheldon: You can\u2019t slay the guard captain with a bronze dagger, my Lord it\u2019s like the car key in your apartment door all over again.\nPenny: Alright, alright, how do I get the sword?\nSheldon: Well, have you been to the Temple of Mithra?\nPenny: Is that the place on the hill with the weird priests in front of it?\nSheldon: No, no, no, it\u2019s\u2026 oh for God\u2019s sakes, gimme. (Takes laptop.)\nPenny: Thank you, I really appreciate this.\nSheldon: You\u2019re going to have to learn to do these things for yourself, Penny.\nPenny: Don\u2019t patronise me, just get the sword.\nHoward: What the frak?\nLeonard: Beats me. They were playing all last night too.\nRaj: It\u2019s like some kind of weird comic book crossover.\nHoward: Like if Hulk were dating Peppermint Patty.\nRaj: I always thought Peppermint Patty was a lesbian?\nLeonard: No, that\u2019s Marcie. Peppermint Patty\u2019s just athletic.\nSheldon: There you go, one enchanted sword.\nPenny: Right, gimme, gimme, gimme, I want to kill the guard captain. (Leaves).\nSheldon: That girl needs to get a life.\nScene: Sheldon\u2019s bedroom. There is a knock on the door. Penny enters.\nPenny (whispering): Sheldon. (Sing-song) Shel-don.\nSheldon: Danger, danger.\nPenny: No danger, look, it\u2019s just me, Penny, look, I got to level 25 and reached Purple Lotus Swamp, right?\nSheldon: You\u2019re in my bedroom.\nPenny: Yeah. Leonard gave me an emergency key.\nSheldon: People can\u2019t be in my bedroom.\nPenny: Okay, well can we go talk in the living room?\nSheldon: I\u2019m not wearing pyjama bottoms.\nPenny: Why not?\nSheldon: I spilled grape juice.\nPenny: Well, wear different pyjamas.\nSheldon: I can\u2019t wear different pyjamas, these are my Monday pyjamas. Penny, people cannot be in my bedroom.\nPenny: Okay, just tell me, is it too soon to join a quest to the Black Castle?\nSheldon: You were invited on a quest to the Black Castle?\nPenny: Yeah, yeah, by some guys in Budapest, I\u2019m just not sure it\u2019s the right move for my character.\nSheldon: Of course it\u2019s not, you\u2019re only a level 25, the Hungarians are just using you for dragon fodder.\nPenny: Really? Boy, you\u2019d think you could trust a horde of Hungarian barbarians.\nCut to Leonard, exiting his bedroom.\nSheldon (off): Please Penny, enough, I have to sleep.\nPenny (off): Okay, well you were great, thanks. (Comes out door) Oh, hey Leonard, listen, don\u2019t got in Sheldon\u2019s room, he\u2019s not wearing bottoms.\nLeonard (knocking on door): Sheldon, you want to catch me up again?\nScene: Dr Gablehauser\u2019s office. Sheldon and Leslie are standing across the desk. \nGablehauser: People, I am very busy today.\nSheldon: I realise that Dr Gablehauser but it is your job, as head of the department, to mediate all inter-departmental disputes. University policy manual chapter four, subsection two, mediation of inter-departmental disputes.\nGablehauser: Fine. Dr Winkle, what colourful name did you call Dr Cooper this time?\nLeslie: Dr Dumbass.\nGablehauser: Dr Cooper, Dr Winkle apologises.\nSheldon: No she doesn\u2019t.\nLeslie: No I don\u2019t.\nSheldon: Here\u2019s the problem. I was clearly signed up to use the mainframe in Buckman 204, and Dr Winkle just wantonly ripped the sign-up sheet off the wall.\nLeslie: It wasn\u2019t even an official sign-up sheet. He printed it himself and he put his name down in every slot for the next six months.\nSheldon: If it is a crime to ensure that the universities resources are not being squandered chasing sub-atomic wild geese then I plead guilty. (His phone rings.) Oh, Penny!\nGablehauser: You need to get that Dr Cooper?\nSheldon: God, no.\nLeslie: Well don\u2019t turn it off, you might miss your call from the Nobel committee letting you know you\u2019ve been nominated as dumbass laureate of the year.\nSheldon: Oh yeah, well, you wouldn\u2019t even be nominated. Dr Gablehauser, I have a series of important multi-bit calculations and simulations to run. All she\u2019s doing is reducing irrelevant data and making a mock\u2026\nGablehauser (as phone rings): Excuse me. Gablehauser. (Holding phone out to Sheldon) It\u2019s for you.\nSheldon: Hello. Penny, this is not a good time. No, I told you, you\u2019re not prepared for the Sanctum of Burning Souls. You need to be in a group of at least five for that quest, and one should be a level 35 healer. Penny, I can\u2019t log on and help you. We\u2019ll talk when I get home. (Puts phone down) I\u2019m not getting the computing time, am I?\nLeslie: Dumbass.\nScene: The apartment. Sheldon enters.\nSheldon: Leonard, you have to do something about Penny. She is interfering with my sleep, she\u2019s interfering with my work, and if I had another significant aspect of my life, I\u2019m sure she\u2019d be interfering with that too.\nLeonard: Why should I do something, you\u2019re the one who introduced her to online gaming.\nSheldon: Well, yes, but you\u2019re the one who said hello to her when she moved in. If you\u2019d simply restrained yourself none of this would be happening.\nLeonard: Why don\u2019t you just tell her to leave you alone.\nSheldon: I did. I told her, I texted her, I sent out a very emphatic twitter. I even changed my facebook status to Sheldon Cooper wishes Penny would leave him alone. I don\u2019t know what else to do.\nLeonard: Well, what am I supposed to do?\nSheldon: I don\u2019t know, but if you don\u2019t figure something out, I warn you I shall become very difficult to live with.\nLeonard: You mean, up until now we\u2019ve been experiencing the happy funtime Sheldon?\nSheldon: Yes.\nLeonard: I\u2019ll go talk to her.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment. She is on her laptop and talking into a headset.\nPenny: No, Fritz, I need you on my flank. No, I don\u2019t know German. Flankenzie, flankenzie!\nLeonard (knocking and entering): Hey Penny.\nPenny: Busy.\nLeonard: Yeah, I see that. Shouldn\u2019t you be at work?\nPenny: I don\u2019t work on Mondays.\nLeonard: It\u2019s Thursday. Listen, Penny.\nPenny: Uh, Queen Penelope AFK. What?\nLeonard: Okay, um, here\u2019s the thing, um, sometimes people, good people, you know, they start playing these games and they find themselves through no fault of their own, you know, kind of, addicted.\nPenny: Yeah, get to the point, I\u2019m about to level up here.\nLeonard: Well, i-i-i-it\u2019s just if a person doesn\u2019t have a sense of achievement in their real life it\u2019s easy to lose themselves in a virtual world where they get a false sense of accomplishment.\nPenny: Yeah, jabber jabber jabber, okay boys, Queen Penelope\u2019s back online.\nLeonard: Penny, you\u2019ve got cheetos in your hair.\nPenny (pulling cheeto out of hair): Oh, thanks. (Eats it.)\nLeonard: Wow.\nScene: Same \u2013 later. Penny is attacking a multi-headed monster with a sword on the screen.A muscular warrior in a cape walks onto the screen.\nWarrior: Hey Penny, it\u2019s me again, Leonard.\nPenny- warrior: Leonard, I said not now.\nLeonard-warrior: Yeah, I know, I\u2019m just a little concerned about you.\nPenny-warrior: I said not now. (Chops off his head.)\nLeonard-warrior\u2019s head: Okay, maybe later.\nScene: The university lunch room.\nRaj: Hey guys.\nLeonard and Howard: Hey.\nRaj (indicating Sheldon): Hey, what\u2019s with him?\nLeonard: Penny\u2019s been keeping him up at night.\nHoward: Me too. But probably in a different way.\nLeonard: She\u2019s gotten really hooked on Age of Conan, she\u2019s playing non-stop.\nRaj: Ah, yes, online gaming addiction. There\u2019s nothing worse than having that multi-player monkey on your back.\nLeonard: Sheldon, wake up.\nSheldon: Danger, danger.\nLeslie (arriving): Afternoon men. Sheldon.\nSheldon: Oh yeah, well your attempt at juvenilizing me by excluding me from the set of adult males\u2026. oh, I\u2019m too tired to do this.\nLeslie: Right, I heard you\u2019ve been pulling all nighters with middle-earth Barbie.\nSheldon: She comes into my room. No-one\u2019s supposed to be in my room.\nLeslie: Well, I would postulate that she\u2019s escaping into the online world to compensate for her sexual frustration.\nHoward: I do that too. But probably in a different way.\nLeonard: That\u2019s not what she\u2019s doing, Leslie, she\u2019s just trying to shore up her self esteem, it has nothing to do with sex.\nLeslie: Everything has to do with sex.\nHoward: Mmmm, testify. (Puts up hand for a handslap.)\nLeslie: I\u2019m not touching that.\nLeonard: Leslie, you are way off base here.\nSheldon: Hang on, Leonard, while I have no respect for Leslie as a scientist, or a human being for that matter, we have to concede her undeniable expertise in the interrelated fields of promiscuity and general sluttiness.\nLeslie: Thank you. My point is that Tinkerbell just needs to get her some.\nSheldon: Some what? Oh, yes, some sexual intercourse.\nHoward: I\u2019ll take the bullet.\nLeonard: Excuse me, this whole idea is insane.\nSheldon: Yeah, yeah, enough debate, I\u2019m going to take action. (Leans over to a good looking man on a nearby table.) Excuse me, are you currently involved in a sexual relationship?\nMan: No.\nSheldon: Would you like to be?\nMan: Uh, sure, why not?\nLeonard: Sheldon\u2026\nSheldon: Zip it pip it. Can I have your phone number?\nMan: Uh\u2026 (checks out Sheldon\u2019s package) Yeah, yeah. (Pulls out pen and writes it on Sheldon\u2019s hand.)\nSheldon: There, problem solved.\nLeslie: Dumbass.\nScene: Penny\u2019s flat. Penny is on her laptop. Everything around her is littered with empty food packaging and red bull cans. She burps loudly. Sheldon is sitting on the sofa.\nPenny: Okay, I\u2019m at the gate to the Treasury of the Ancients, I\u2019m going in.\nSheldon: Stay close to the wall. Avoid the mummies.\nPenny: Got it.\nSheldon: I must say, you\u2019re playing very well for a woman of 23?\nPenny: 22.\nSheldon: Right. 22. (Cut to his screen, he is filling in an online dating profile.)\nPenny: Oh, here come the mummies, which spell do I use? The hateful strike, or the frenzy stance?\nSheldon: What happened to the rest of your group?\nPenny: I dumped them, they\u2019re a bunch of wussies.\nSheldon: Frenzy stance.\nPenny: Frenzy, frenzy, frenzy, frenzy, frenzy!\nSheldon: So listen, would you describe your ideal vacation as a wild adventure to unknown lands, or staying at home curled up with a good book?\nPenny: What?\nSheldon: These are market research questions. I\u2019m filling out the online registration for your game.\nPenny: Oh, okay, wild adventure. Oh, frenzy stance isn\u2019t working, die you undead mummy, die!\nSheldon: Drink a healing potion.\nPenny: Thank you.\nSheldon: You\u2019re welcome. Anyhow, on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being always initiated by him, and 5 being always initiated by you, how do you prefer your sexual encounters to begin?\nPenny: That\u2019s on the registration?\nSheldon: Oh yes, it\u2019s quite extensive. But if we complete it, we get a free expansion pack, 75 additional quests.\nPenny: Ooh, awesome, okay, I totally like to initiate I\u2019m a big old five.\nSheldon: Good to know. Big old five.\nScene: The apartment. Leonard enters. There is a strange man sitting on the sofa.\nLeonard: Hello.\nMan: Hi.\nSheldon: Leonard, this is Tom.\nLeonard: Hi Tom. Sheldon? Didn\u2019t I explain to you about your little mistake in the cafeteria?\nSheldon: Yes, you were very clear, as was everyone else at the table. Tom, however, has been chosen by science as a suitable mate for Penny.\nLeonard: Chosen by science?\nSheldon: Well, what passes for science on dating sites. They claim to use heuristic algorithms, but it may well be hokum.\nLeonard: You got Penny to sign up for online dating?\nSheldon: No, of course not. No, I used trickery and deceit.\nLeonard: This is bad.\nSheldon: Tom is a paramedic with the fire department, but he\u2019s going to med school at night, uh, he likes the outdoors, and, uh, strong women who initiate sex.\nLeonard: Really, really bad.\nSheldon: I\u2019m surprised you struck out with Penny. Apparently she\u2019s a big old five.\nPenny (entering, looking ratty in baggy clothes and with her hair unwashed): Sheldon, what do you want.\nSheldon: Oh, good, you got my note. Penny, I\u2019d like you to meet Tom, uh, Penny, this is Tom, Tom, may I present Penny.\nTom: Hi Penny.\nPenny: Yeah, Hi, listen, as long as I\u2019m here, I\u2019m on a quest with a bunch of noobs, they don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing, we\u2019ve got one assassin, three spellcasters and no tank.\nSheldon: Can we talk about this later.\nPenny: No, no, no, no, I need you now.\nSheldon: But wouldn\u2019t you prefer to socialise with Tom, who is a sexually passive outdoorsman.\nPenny: Whatever, I\u2019ll figure it out myself.\nTom: Bye, Penny. I\u2019m sorry, dude, she didn\u2019t look anything like her picture.\nLeonard: They never do.\nScene: Inside the game. Penny-warrior is standing next to a battle horse. \nWarrior: Hello, fair Penny.\nPenny-warrior: Who are you?\nWarrior: It is I, Sir Howard of Wolowitz. Can I interest you in an afternoon of spirited questing, followed by a flagon of ale at yon virtual tavern?\nPenny-warrior: Yeah, sure, why not?\nPenny: Oh my God, I need help. (Closes laptop and throws it away.) \nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "9_14": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The foyer.\nSheldon: Here\u2019s a fun Postal fact. The inner side of our mailbox is under federal jurisdiction. So, if you broke my right thumb, that\u2019s Pasadena city police. But if you broke my left thumb, that\u2019s the FBI.\nLeonard: If I\u2019m going to jail, I\u2019m killing him, not breaking his thumb.\nPenny: Yeah.\nSheldon: Oh, I got a letter from my Meemaw. Umm. Smell this.\nPenny: What is that?\nSheldon: Uh, roses, bengay, and Dr. Scholls\u2019 foot powder.\nPenny: Ah, yeah, Grandma by Calvin Klein. You know, the last time I got a hand written letter it was from someone who told me I parked like a blind person.\nLeonard: That someone has a name.\nSheldon: Uh, thank you. Oh, Meemaw got a new set of teeth. Oh, but then she found her old ones. Oh, so now the new ones are just gonna be her church teeth.\nLeonard: Fun. Like your Comic-Con Spock ears and your around the house Spock ears.\nPenny: I park fine.\nSheldon: Oh, my goodness, she\u2019s coming to visit!\nLeonard: Oh, it\u2019ll be nice to finally meet her.\nSheldon: Oh, you are going to love her. She is the kindest, sweetest woman you\u2019ll ever meet. Unless you\u2019re a gopher digging up her vegetable garden. In that case, you can expect to have your head bashed in with a shovel.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The airport arrivals area.\nSheldon: That\u2019s not her. That\u2019s not her. That\u2019s not her. That\u2019s not her. That\u2019s not her. That\u2019s not her. That\u2019s not her. That\u2019s not her.\nLeonard: Really? The old Asian man is not your Meemaw?\nSheldon: And that\u2019s not helpful. You know, I got her an iPhone for Christmas. I\u2019ll see where she is.\nLeonard: Oh, that\u2019s nice. Most people her age don\u2019t embrace technology.\nSheldon: Oh, no, she doesn\u2019t even know she has it. No, I had my sister slip it in her bag so that I can track her like a sea turtle.\nLeonard: Same as when we lost you at the zoo.\nSheldon: Uh, for the hundredth time, I smelled kettle corn and couldn\u2019t find the cart.\nLeonard: Still doesn\u2019t explain how you ended up on the freeway divider.\nMeemaw: Moon Pie.\nSheldon: Meemaw. I\u2019m so happy to see you.\nMeemaw: I\u2019m so happy to see you, too.\nSheldon: Oh. You got even smaller. I love it. Uh, Meemaw, this is Leonard. Leonard, this is my Meemaw.\nLeonard: Hi. So nice to finally meet you. Let me take this for you, Meemaw.\nMeemaw: Thank you.\nSheldon: No. Oh, no. Now you call her Constance. I call her Meemaw. You have your own Meemaw. It\u2019s not my fault she died when you were four.\nMeemaw: Is that nice to say to your friend?\nSheldon: It isn\u2019t, Meemaw. Sorry, Leonard.\nLeonard: Can you please live with us forever?\nScene: The comic book store.\nHoward: That\u2019s ridiculous. If you had a superpower, and spent your whole life being told to suppress it, when you finally decide to embrace that power, why hide in isolation?\nRaj: I\u2019m sorry, and how much money did your version of Frozen make?\nHoward: I\u2019m just saying, instead of Let it Go, she should really sing, Look At Me Hiding in a Freezer Like a Dove Bar.\nRaj: She built an ice castle, made a snow monster and gave herself a complete makeover in one day. You know what I saw you do today? Eat a block of cream cheese straight from the foil and lie about it to your wife.\nGirl: Sorry for eavesdropping, but did you know they actually had the song Let It Go in place before they finalized the story?\nRaj: Yeah, that\u2019s true. In fact, they liked the song so much, they retooled the whole script around it.\nGirl: Which is probably why that movie sucks.\nHoward: Here we are talking about Frozen, and yet, you got burned.\nRaj: I\u2019m so sorry but, how can you not like that movie?\nGirl: I just think it gets more credit than it deserves.\nHoward: Oh, that\u2019s what I said an hour ago.\nGirl: Wow. You\u2019ve been talking about Frozen for an hour?\nHoward: You should\u2019ve seen us after The Good Dinosaur.\nRaj: It was a classic western set in the post-Jurassic period, and it changed my life.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Are you comfortable?\nMeemaw: Very. It\u2019s nice to rest after 800 flights of stairs.\nSheldon: You were so cute, huffin\u2019 and puffin\u2019. There\u2019s Amy. I just know you\u2019re gonna hit it off. You both have the same fashion sense. Hello. Come in, say hi to my Meemaw.\nAmy: Hi. Nice to meet you.\nMeemaw: Nice to meet you, too.\nAmy: How was your trip?\nMeemaw: Wonderful. And the pilot did such a good job, I gave him a butterscotch.\nAmy: That\u2019s great. And look at you, sitting in Sheldon\u2019s spot. You know, I don\u2019t even get to sit there.\nSheldon: Yeah. And you never will. Ooh, hey, oh, ask her to do the tissue thing. Do it, ask her.\nAmy: Can I have a tissue?\nMeemaw: Of course.\nSheldon: Isn\u2019t that the best? She\u2019s like Grandma Spider-Man.\nMeemaw: He\u2019s been saying that since he was little. I still don\u2019t know what it means.\nSheldon: Oh, well, you two sit down and get to know each other. I\u2019ll get your room ready.\nMeemaw: Oh, now don\u2019t you go looking through my suitcase for presents.\nSheldon: If I did, would I find any?\nMeemaw: Maybe. But you also might find my brassieres and bloomers.\nSheldon: That\u2019s a risk I\u2019m willing to take.\nAmy: Well, this is so nice. He\u2019s so excited to have you here and\u2026\nMeemaw: Okay, now let\u2019s you and me get something straight. He may think that I came to bake him cookies, but the real reason is to size you up.\nAmy: S, s, si, size me up?\nMeemaw: Sheldon\u2019s mother may be okay with you, but I\u2019m not so easy.\nAmy: Well, I, I\u2019m, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll like me once you get to know me.\nMeemaw: Oh, you better hope so.\nSheldon: A Texas Special cattle and calf car train set with authentic horn and bell. Thank you, Meemaw.\nMeemaw: Oh, you\u2019re welcome, Moon Pie.\nSheldon: Amy, why don\u2019t you look excited? Well, you get to watch me play with this.\nScene: The comic book store.\nRaj: Oh, I see you\u2019re reading Saga.\nGirl: Yeah, I hear it\u2019s pretty good.\nRaj: It is, and not a lot of comics have a woman with wings breastfeeding a baby right on the cover.\nGirl: I\u2019ll take your word for it.\nHoward: You should. He\u2019s really looked.\nRaj: I\u2019m Raj, by the way. This is Howard.\nHoward: Hi.\nGirl: Claire.\nRaj: Well, I\u2019ve never seen you here before, Claire.\nClaire: It\u2019s my first time. I\u2019m looking for inspiration for this movie I\u2019m writing.\nHoward: You\u2019re a screenwriter?\nClaire: Well, screenwriter, slash bartender, slash, a month away from living in my car.\nRaj: Yeah, I get that. I\u2019m a scientist, slash party planner, slash small-dog enthusiast, slash guy who probably should have stopped at scientist.\nClaire: You\u2019re really a scientist?\nRaj: Well, astrophysicist.\nClaire: That\u2019s perfect. Do you think I could pick your brain for my movie some time? It\u2019s animated sci-fi for kids.\nRaj: Sure. I love animated movies.\nHoward: He does, and he has the Lilo & Stitch collector plates to prove it.\nRaj: Excuse me for wanting a little magic in my life.\nClaire: Here\u2019s my number. Give me a call, we\u2019ll get together.\nRaj: Yeah, great.\nClaire: See ya.\nRaj: Yeah, bye.\nHoward: What are you doing? You have a girlfriend.\nRaj: So?\nHoward: So, how do you think she\u2019d feel about you helping a beautiful girl with her screenplay?\nRaj: I wouldn\u2019t say she\u2019s beautiful.\nHoward: Really? You don\u2019t think she\u2019s attractive?\nRaj: I do. I just wouldn\u2019t tell my girlfriend.\nScene: The apartment.\nPenny: Constance, are you sure I can\u2019t pour you some wine?\nMeemaw: Oh, no wine for me. Sheldon\u2019s bringing me my whiskey.\nSheldon: Here you go, Meemaw. I made it just how you like, a lot in a glass.\nMeemaw: Thank you, Moon Pie.\nAmy: I\u2019m curious. Why do you call Sheldon Moon Pie?\nMeemaw: \u2018Cause he\u2019s so nummy-nummy.\nLeonard and Penny: She could just eat him up.\nSheldon: And I call her Meemaw because, well, just, well, look at her.\nMeemaw: It\u2019s interesting that Leonard and Penny know about his nickname and you don\u2019t.\nAmy: Oh, well, you know, now, now that I\u2019m hearing it, it does sound familiar.\nSheldon: How could it? I never told you, and you never bothered to ask.\nAmy: Well, now I know.\nSheldon: Yeah.\nMeemaw: So, Penny, I understand you have a new job.\nPenny: Yes. I\u2019m a pharmaceutical sales rep.\nMeemaw: Oh. It\u2019s so wonderful that you modern gals can have it all. A husband and a full-time career.\nAmy: I have a relationship and a full-time career, too.\nMeemaw: That doesn\u2019t bode well.\nAmy: Why not? You, you just said it\u2019s okay for her to work.\nMeemaw: Well, Leonard doesn\u2019t need as much tending to as Sheldon does. And as Moon Pie explained, Leonard\u2019s work is more of a hobby.\nLeonard: That\u2019s my best friend.\nPenny: Yeah.\nAmy: Look, I, I get that you\u2019re protective of your grandson, but he\u2019s an adult now. Maybe I understand what he needs better than you do.\nMeemaw: I appreciate your honesty, dear.\nAmy: Thank you.\nMeemaw: And here\u2019s some more honesty. I don\u2019t like you very much.\nAmy: Well, maybe I don\u2019t like you either.\nSheldon: Well, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. You have to like each other. Well, we have a 4:30 reservation at Applebee\u2019s.\nAmy: I think I should leave.\nSheldon: But why? Other than you two fighting, we\u2019re having such a good time.\nAmy: The minute you left the room, your precious meemaw started giving me a really hard time. I don\u2019t need this.\nMeemaw: Let her go. And under no circumstance will you give her that engagement ring.\nAmy: What ring?\nLeonard: Maybe we should give them some privacy.\nPenny: Yeah, yeah, yeah. You go ahead. I\u2019ll catch up with you.\nAmy: You have an engagement ring?\nSheldon: Yes.\nAmy: Penny, did you know about this?\nPenny: All right, let\u2019s go.\nAmy: When did you get an engagement ring?\nSheldon: My mother gave it to me, and I had been thinking about giving it to you, but then we broke up.\nMeemaw: Well, thank goodness for that.\nAmy: Sheldon, will you please tell your grandmother to stay out of this?\nSheldon: Oh, I don\u2019t think I could do that.\nMeemaw: Sheldon, tell this girl that my ring will never be on her finger.\nSheldon: I\u2019m gonna opt out of that one, too.\nAmy: Who said I even want to be engaged to him? And if I do, I, I don\u2019t need your hand-me-downs.\nSheldon: All right, all right, look, l, let\u2019s all, let\u2019s remain calm and analyse this situation. Now, I realize that you\u2019ve only known each other for less than a day, but is it possible this crankiness is because your cycles have synced?\nMeemaw: You leave the room and let the grown-ups talk. Now.\nAmy: Don\u2019t speak to him like he\u2019s a child.\nSheldon: Thank you. I\u2019m gonna go next door and play with Leonard.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s kitchen.\nBernadette: Okay, so you met this girl, you exchanged numbers, and you\u2019re gonna meet up with her.\nRaj: Just to help her with her screenplay.\nBernadette: Oh. Well, I guess that\u2019s not so bad.\nHoward: You weren\u2019t there. He was really flirting.\nRaj: Hey, it\u2019s not my fault if American women project their fantasies on foreigners with the kind of magical voice that grants wishes.\nBernadette: I\u2019m sure it was harmless. People flirt. No big deal.\nHoward: Really? So it\u2019s okay if I fl\u2026\nBernadette: Not you. I own your ass. The real question is, where are you with Emily?\nRaj: Uh, it\u2019s hard to say. I think we\u2019re good, but things like this make me wonder if Emily\u2019s really the right person for me. I mean, did you guys ever have doubts about each other?\nHoward: No. Never.\nBernadette: Absolutely.\nHoward: What?\nBernadette: Howie, you forget how much of our early dates involved you doing magic and me doing this.\nHoward: Fine. I had reservations about you, too.\nBernadette: No, you didn\u2019t.\nHoward: No, I didn\u2019t.\nBernadette: Well, it doesn\u2019t matter now, \u2019cause I love how things worked out.\nHoward: Me, too. And I think you\u2019re even more beautiful than this rose.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment.\nPenny: Wow. You know, the last time I saw my grandma, the most exciting thing was watching the ash of her cigarette get longer and wondering if it was gonna fall in her pudding.\nLeonard: Did it?\nPenny: Yeah, right in there. She ate it and everything.\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard and Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard and Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard and Penny.\nPenny: Come in.\nLeonard: Hey. What happened? Is Amy gone?\nSheldon: No. They asked me to leave so they could speak privately.\nPenny: Uh-oh.\nSheldon: Yeah, I know. It was quite tense. So here\u2019s the million dollar question, uh, who wants to pop over there and get my trains?\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s kitchen.\nRaj: All right. I\u2019ve made up my mind. I\u2019m gonna do the right thing, call this girl, and let her know that I\u2019m in a relationship.\nHoward: Okay, so far we\u2019ve heard, made up my mind I\u2019m dumping Emily.\nBernadette: Made up my mind to date both of them by pretending to be twin brothers.\nHoward: And made up my mind, I\u2019ll ask for a threesome and if they say no, play it off as a joke.\nRaj: I\u2019m calling her. And the threesome didn\u2019t deserve the belly laugh it got.\nBernadette: You\u2019re right. It could totally happen.\nClaire (voice): Hello?\nRaj: Hi. Hi. Yeah, it\u2019s Raj. Rajesh. We met at the comic book store.\nClaire: Hey, what\u2019s up? Figure out what time you\u2019re free?\nRaj: Actually, that\u2019s why I\u2019m calling. I, um, I just, I need to let you know that I have a girlfriend.\nClaire: Okay. Good for you.\nRaj: Well, no, no. I, I didn\u2019t want to mislead you after you asked me out.\nClaire: I didn\u2019t ask you out. I just need help with my screenplay.\nRaj: Wait, are you saying that we didn\u2019t have a vibe?\nClaire: Why do you care if we have a vibe? You have a girlfriend.\nRaj: Come on, I just told you I had a girlfriend. The least you can do is tell me if we had a vibe.\nClaire: Sure, we had a vibe.\nRaj: I knew it. Okay, we did have a vibe. This is exciting. What\u2019s my next move?\nBernadette: You still have a girlfriend.\nRaj: Right. Good catch. Anyway, so I\u2019m sorry to waste your time. And, uh, and good luck with your screenplay.\nClaire: Hang on. We\u2019re both adults. We can still get together without it meaning anything.\nRaj: Not me. Ever since you admitted we had a vibe, I\u2019ve been planning our wedding.\nClaire: Look, it\u2019s just coffee. I\u2019ll ask you some questions about science, and if you propose, I promise to say no.\nRaj: Okay. That hurts a little, but okay.\nClaire: Great. I\u2019ll text you.\nRaj: Bye. All right. So, uh, we\u2019re meeting for coffee like two adults. Everybody\u2019s happy. Easy peasy.\nBernadette: Are you gonna tell Emily?\nRaj: Yeah, of course. We have no secrets.\nHoward: When are you gonna tell Emily?\nRaj: He lied about the cream cheese. He ate the whole thing. I saw him.\nScene: The apartment. \nAmy: Look, I know you think I\u2019m not right for Sheldon, but trust me, I\u2019m his best shot. You have no idea how much I put up with.\nMeemaw: I know more than you think I do.\nAmy: Really? You know what it\u2019s like to have date night ruined because Google changed their font?\nMeemaw: Young lady, if you think I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to live with a stubborn, egotistical man, then you\u2019re wrong. \u2018Cause that was my husband.\nAmy: Really?\nMeemaw: There were days I wanted to fill his pockets with corn and toss him in the pigpen.\nAmy: Well, if you understand, then why are you giving me such a hard time?\nMeemaw: Because when you broke up with Sheldon, it hurt him deeply, and I don\u2019t want to see that happen again.\nPenny: Hi. Sorry. Sheldon would like to say something to you.\nSheldon: No, I wouldn\u2019t.\nLeonard: Just get in here.\nSheldon: Hello.\nPenny: Go ahead.\nSheldon: Meemaw, look, I\u2019m sorry, but I have to defend my girlfriend to you.\nAmy: Oh, Sheldon, thank you.\nSheldon: Oh, great, now you\u2019re gonna get emotional. I always looked up to you and Pop-Pop. I, I know what a challenging man he could be, but I saw you stand by him and-and make him into a better person.\nMeemaw: I did.\nSheldon: Yeah, well, that is exactly what I\u2019ve been doing the last five years with this little work in progress.\nLeonard: He never disappoints, does he?\nAmy: I think what Sheldon means to say is we\u2019ve both grown together. Isn\u2019t that right?\nSheldon: Well\u2026\nPenny: Say yes.\nSheldon: Yes.\nMeemaw: Fine. If you feel so strongly, I won\u2019t stand in your way.\nSheldon: Thank you.\nAmy: So if he wanted to give me that engagement ring, we would have your blessing?\nMeemaw: I suppose.\nSheldon: I just gave you my virginity, woman. Cool your jets.\nScene: The comic book store.\nRaj: Yeah, see, if you just change the story to the destruction of our galaxy, then a super massive black hole could work.\nClaire: This is great. Thank you so much. I just got to figure out a way for everyone to die that isn\u2019t too scary for children.\nFantasy seqeunce.\nRaj: And that\u2019s how Mommy and Daddy met.\nClaire: Hey, did you ever tell Emily about us?\nRaj: I will.\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "8_10": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Hello. I\u2019m Doctor Sheldon Cooper, and welcome to Sheldon Cooper presents Fun with Flags, the final episode flagtacular. I knew it was coming. Still scary. Now, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re thinking, the final episode? Who will stand between us and flag ignorance?\nAmy: I know I was thinking that. Is this a show on flags or mind reading?\nSheldon: But the truth is I can no longer balance a full-time career, a popular Internet show, and a girlfriend.\nAmy: And he really does have one, you jerks on the comment board.\nSheldon: So as they say, all good things must come to an end.\nAmy: After only 232 episodes.\nSheldon: 233 if we include the one somebody forgot to press record on.\nAmy: You said you weren\u2019t gonna bring that up.\nSheldon: And you said you pressed record. Anyway, please sit back, relax, and join us as we take our final lap, as indicated by the waving of this racing flag. And, of course, white flags can also represent surrender, the Stewards of Gondor, and the Japanese Minamoto clan, but I\u2019m sure you remember that from episode sixty-two, White Flags, Who\u2019s Wavin\u2019 \u2018Em and Why?\nAmy: That was a good one.\nSheldon: It was so good.\nCredits sequence. \nScene: An office at the university.\nRaj: You know, I thought cleaning out a dead professor\u2019s office was gonna just be boring, but then I found his dentures and realized it\u2019s also gross.\nHoward: Doesn\u2019t Professor Abbott\u2019s family want any of this stuff?\nLeonard: I don\u2019t think he had a family.\nRaj: That\u2019s rough.\nLeonard: I know. You can spend your whole life working, and at the end all that\u2019s left are some papers in a box.\nHoward: Makes you think. Oh, well.\nLeonard: Hey. Hey, we\u2019re supposed to look through all this stuff before we throw it away in case it\u2019s important.\nHoward: I did. It\u2019s all outdated or disproved.\nRaj: I don\u2019t know. This old pen kind of proves gravity. When I tilt it, her bathing suit falls right off.\nHoward: Oh, my dad used to have a pen like that. I dated it all through sixth grade.\nLeonard: It still feels weird just throwing away his work like this.\nHoward: Don\u2019t feel bad. Someday someone will be throwing out your work, too.\nLeonard: That someone was Sheldon, and the day was yesterday. Hey, look at this. Dear Roger, to be opened upon your first great discovery. Love, Mom. Wow, look at the date. He saved this fifty years and never got to open it.\nHoward: That\u2019s intense.\nRaj: Poor Roger Abbott.\nHoward: Roger Abbott sounds just like Roger Rabbit.\nRaj: Roger Abbott, Roger Abbott, Roger Abbott. Oh, my God, Leonard, I know he\u2019s dead, but try it. It\u2019s fun. Roger Abbott, Roger Abbott.\nScene: A hotel conference room.\nDan: Penny. Oh, my rookie of the year.\nPenny: Oh, Dan. My boss who didn\u2019t want to hire me and now\u2019s a little hug machine.\nDan: Oh, look at you. Brand-new and already the third best sales rep.\nPenny: Aw.\nDan: Yes. Why don\u2019t you come over to my table.\nPenny: I\u2019ll be right there. Bernadette\u2019s just parking the car.\nDan: Oh, good. Bernadette. Cute, sweet, vicious little Bernadette.\nPenny: Come on. She\u2019s not that bad.\nDan: Oh, yeah? At the company picnic she yelled at me and my grandson for losing the three-legged race. I mean, he still calls her that mean kid with the big boobies.\nPenny: I know she can be a little intense, but, I swear, she is so sweet once you get past all the\u2026\nBernadette: Hey, what are you talking about?\nPenny: Oh. We were just talking about how much we love working with you. Isn\u2019t that right? Dan?\nScene: The apartment. \nSheldon: Over the years here at Fun With Flags, we\u2019ve had an opportunity to learn, laugh, wonder.\nAmy: And, yes, even shed a tear or two.\nSheldon: Like when you do a two-hour Fourth of July spectacular and it doesn\u2019t get recorded.\nAmy: How many times do I have to say I\u2019m sorry?\nSheldon: How about four thousand. One for every domino I set up to make that American flag. Please enjoy these highlights.\nHighlight 1\nSheldon: Crikey, what flag do we have today?\nAmy: Australia, mate.\nHighlight 2\nSheldon: And now it\u2019s time for the speed round of Flag or Not a Flag.\nKripke: Fwag, fwag, not a fwag, fwag, I am cwushing this.\nHighlight 3\nAmy: Say, Betsy Ross, what you working on?\nSheldon: I have no idea. Because the story of me sewing the first American flag is unsupported poppycock.\nAmy: Then who did sew it, hmm?\nSheldon: Don\u2019t ask me. I\u2019m just a simple seamstress whose descendants are out to make a quick buck.\nHighlight 4\nSheldon: Fancy a dip, my dear?\nAmy: I do.\nSheldon: Wait, that purple flag indicates that marine pests, such as jellyfish, are present.\nAmy: Wow, that flag is a lifesaver.\nSheldon: No. This is. Stop looking at my legs.\nHighlight 5\nKripke: Not a fwag, fwag, fwag, not a fwag. Fwag. Ugh cwap.\nScene: The office.\nRaj: When stuff like this gets me down, you know what I like to do?\nHoward: Sing Hakuna Matata like an eight-year-old girl?\nRaj: Wrong, smarty-pants. It\u2019s Everything Is Awesome from The Lego Movie.\nLeonard: Look at these notebooks. They\u2019re full of pages and pages of data. He clearly spent years on this.\nHoward: Mmm. It\u2019s just columns of random numbers. Toss it.\nLeonard: Well, but what if this was a potential breakthrough for him? What if, what if this is the thing that would\u2019ve finally let him open that bottle of champagne?\nRaj: Maybe he didn\u2019t know what to pair champagne with. Strawberries, caviar, oysters. All good choices. Yeah, that look right there is why people eat before they come to your parties.\nLeonard: This has to mean something.\nHoward: Well, there\u2019s no discernible pattern that I can see, but it shouldn\u2019t be too hard to run the numbers and check.\nLeonard: Well, maybe we can get some time on the supercomputer.\nHoward: Sure. We could try multiple regressions with varying physical and experimental constants.\nLeonard: Oh, we could run a pattern-matching algorithm against well-known unsolved physics problems.\nHoward: Ooh, it might be a substitution cipher. We could start with basic cryptanalysis.\nRaj: Or we could talk to this guy he used to share an office with.\nHoward: Oh, let\u2019s do that.\nLeonard: Because you don\u2019t know how to do cryptanalysis, do you?\nHoward: Yeah, I\u2019m not even sure if it\u2019s the right word.\nScene: The conference room. \nPenny: So, Dan, you have a grandson. How old is he?\nDan: Seven.\nBernadette: Oh, yeah. I remember him from the picnic. He was the one crying like a wuss the whole time.\nPenny: I heard he was being picked on by a mean kid.\nBernadette: Just builds character. Like my dad said, nobody likes a crybaby except their mommies and Democrats.\u201d\nDan: I need another drink.\nBernadette: What\u2019s his problem?\nPenny: Oh, I don\u2019t know. Maybe he didn\u2019t like the fact that you called his grandson a wuss.\nBernadette: Well, I didn\u2019t think you were supposed to say sissy anymore.\nPenny: Okay, look, I know what a good person you are, but sometimes people think you might come off a little harsh.\nBernadette: What? I\u2019m, like, the sweetest person I know. Look at me. I should be in a tree baking cookies.\nPenny: Yes, but once in a while, people think you\u2019re a little mean.\nBernadette: Oh, yeah? You one of those people?\nPenny: No. No, no, no. I think the cookie thing.\nScene: The apartment.\nAmy: Action.\nSheldon: Welcome back. Our guest today is a returning fan favourite. He puts the reading in your rainbow, the Geordi in your La Forge, and the Kunta in your Kinte, Mr. LeVar Burton.\nLeVar Burton: Thank you, Sheldon. Now, remember our deal.\nSheldon: You do this, I delete your contact information.\nLeVar: While?\nSheldon: While you watch me do it.\nLeVar: Great. Happy to be back.\nSheldon: Well, since you\u2019re here, I\u2019d like to get your opinion on something. In honour of Black History Month, I portrayed George Washington Carver in a loving tribute that my roommate called wildly racist. What do you think? (On recording) Hi. My name is George.\nLeVar: Oh, hell, no.\nSheldon: You heard him, Leonard. No, it\u2019s not racist.\nScene: An apartment building.\nHoward: Are we sure this is the place?\nRaj: The doorman said this is the right building.\nLeonard: I think if you\u2019re pulling up your pants, you\u2019re not a doorman. (Knocks)\nMan (off): Who is it?\nLeonard: Uh, I\u2019ve been looking for a Professor Sharpe?\nProf Sharpe: Hold on. Can I help you?\nLeonard: Hi. We\u2019re from the university. We\u2019re trying to get some information about Professor Abbott.\nHoward: We were cleaning out his office and found these books full of numbers.\nLeonard: Any chance you know what it is?\nProf Sharpe: Yes, he was always working on this.\nRaj: I was thinking it might be some sort of interstellar coordinate system, maybe an updated version of Hubble\u2019s law. I keep seeing the number 90 repeating. That could be the angle of perturbation of a distant galaxy.\nProf Sharpe: It\u2019s the number of calories in a yoghurt. That\u2019s his food diary.\nLeonard: Really?\nProf Sharpe: Yeah, he wrote down everything he ever ate. He was convinced that calorie restriction was the key to living forever.\nRaj: Does it work?\nHoward: Seriously?\nRaj: Well, he could have been hit by a bus. You don\u2019t know.\nProf Sharpe: Sorry it\u2019s not more interesting. On the bright side, you didn\u2019t have to listen to his stomach growl for 35 years.\nLeonard: So, was there anything that Professor Abbott worked on during his life that came close to an accomplishment?\nProf Sharpe: To be honest, his research never amounted to anything.\nRaj: You were his colleague. How did your research turn out? Great. Hey, this is the apartment you get when you win a Nobel.\nRaj: Well, you could be very frugal. I\u2019m getting a little tired of everybody\u2019s sarcasm.\nScene: The conference room.\nBernadette: I\u2019m not a bully. I mean, maybe I come off a little strong, but that\u2019s only because my dad raised me to be tough and not to take crap from anybody.\nPenny: No. That\u2019s fine, but there\u2019s a difference between being tough and telling your friend her new pants look like a saggy diaper.\nBernadette: I did say that, didn\u2019t I?\nPenny: Yeah, you did. I felt so self-conscious, I had to return them.\nBernadette: Where? To Babies R Us?\nPenny: You\u2019re doing it again.\nBernadette: Okay, sorry. Can we just go? I feel like everybody hates me.\nPenny: Oh, come on, they don\u2019t hate you, all right? They\u2019re just a little intimidated. All you need to do is show everyone how sweet you really are.\nBernadette: I think I\u2019d rather go.\nPenny: No, come on. You are not going anywhere, all right? I am here for you, and we are gonna fix this together.\nBernadette: Thank you.\nPenny: Even though your dress is ugly.\nScene:The apartment.\nSheldon: Well, my little flag-keteers, it looks like the last episode of Fun with Flags is at an end. If I could, I would run each and every one of you viewers up a flagpole and salute you. And if you touched the ground, burn you. I\u2019d like to take a moment to personally thank Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler, who you may or may not know is the first woman to co-host a flag or banner-related Internet info-tainment show.\nAmy: Take that, glass ceiling.\nSheldon: And if I may get serious for a moment, hosting this show has been one crazy ride. But with all its ups and downs, I wouldn\u2019t give it up for the world. Except for now, when I\u2019m giving it up. Before I sign off, I\u2019d, uh, I\u2019d like to share with you all one last use for a white flag. It\u2019s good for times like this. Good night.\nAmy: Cut. Sheldon, that was beautiful.\nSheldon: If you didn\u2019t press record\u2026\nAmy: I pressed it.\nScene: The office.\nLeonard: Well, that\u2019s it. That\u2019s the end of Roger Abbott.\nRaj: And we still don\u2019t know who framed him.\nLeonard: I still keep thinking about how an entire life can seemingly amount to nothing.\nHoward: I guess the sad truth is, not everyone will accomplish something great. Some of us may just have to find meaning in the little moments that make up life.\nLeonard: That\u2019s a nice way of looking at it.\nHoward: Yeah for you, not for me. I went to space. I\u2019m covered.\nLeonard: You know what? This bottle was meant to celebrate an achievement. Let\u2019s make a pact. When one of us gets their first big breakthrough, we\u2019ll celebrate by opening this bottle of champagne and toasting Professor Abbott.\nHoward: I love that.\nRaj: Yeah, me, too.\nLeonard: Then, of course, rubbing our success in Sheldon\u2019s face.\nRaj: Oh, well, that\u2019s the best part.\nHoward: Oh, yeah.\nScene: The conference room.\nBernadette: Dan, could I talk to you for a minute?\nDan: Sure, go ahead.\nBernadette: Just want you to know I didn\u2019t mean to be rude about your grandson.\nDan: No, it\u2019s okay.\nBernadette: No, it\u2019s not. Penny told me that everyone\u2019s scared of me.\nDan: What? What? Why would she say that? You know she drinks, right?\nPenny: What?\nBernadette: No, she\u2019s right, and I just want you to know that from now on, I\u2019m gonna be much more sensitive. I don\u2019t want anyone walking on eggshells around me.\nDan: Oh, well, okay, then, uh, one thing I\u2019ve been meaning to tell you is that the company is gonna stop paying for our coffee.\nBernadette: No problem. When does that start?\nDan: Five months ago.\nBernadette: What?\nDan: Yeah.\nBernadette: Who\u2019s been paying for my coffee?\nDan: All of us.\nPenny: Yeah. It comes from the swear jar we put money in when you curse.\nBernadette: What else don\u2019t I know about?\nPenny: Uh, well, you know your private bathroom?\nBernadette: Yeah?\nPenny: That was supposed to be for the whole floor.\nBernadette: You\u2019re kidding.\nDan: No, no. It\u2019s okay. It only really affected Wheelchair Kathy, and she\u2019s back in the hospital now, so it all worked out.\nBernadette: I feel so bad.\nPenny: Well, then, maybe you shouldn\u2019t have named her Wheelchair Kathy.\nBernadette: Oh, my God. I thought everybody liked me, but I\u2019m just a monster.\nDan: But a cute one, like that, uh, eyeball guy in Monsters, Inc.\nBernadette: No, I\u2019m the worst. I\u2019m a terrible person.\nDan: Come on, don\u2019t cry. It\u2019s okay.\nBernadette: It\u2019s not okay. How can I even work here anymore?\nPenny: Because this company needs you.\nDan: It\u2019s fine. We don\u2019t mind paying for the coffee.\nBernadette: I can\u2019t let you do that.\nDan: Maybe we could get you an espresso machine for your office.\nBernadette: I guess that would be all right.\nPenny: See? You don\u2019t have to be mean to get what you want.\nBernadette: You\u2019re right. Now where did we land on my bathroom?\nScene: The apartment. \nLeonard: Hey.\nSheldon: Hello.\nLeonard: How come you\u2019re up so late?\nSheldon: I posted the last episode of Fun with Flags hours ago, and not a single person cared enough to comment. All that effort for nothing.\nLeonard: Mm. I know how you feel. I spent the day throwing out a man\u2019s entire career, and all that\u2019s left is an old bottle of champagne and a naked lady pen that Raj took when he thought no one was looking.\nSheldon: It\u2019s not the same thing. I don\u2019t think you know how I feel at all.\nLeonard: Sad?\nSheldon: Hmm. You do get me. Someone left a comment.\nLeonard: Yeah. What did they say?\nSheldon: Too bad your show is done. I kind of liked it. Leonard, did you hear that? Oh, the people are heartbroken. I can\u2019t take this away from the world. Fun with Flags is back.\nLeonard: Congratulations.\nSheldon: Let\u2019s celebrate.\nLeonard: Sheldon, that wasn\u2019t for you.\nSheldon: Oh, no, I\u2019m not going to drink it. I just wanted to hear the pop. Yeah, I knew it was coming. Still scary.\nScene: LeVar Burton\u2019s house.\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) LeVar Burton? (Knock, knock, knock) LeVar Burton? (Knock, knock, knock) LeVar Burton?\nLeVar: Ugh. What are you doing here?\nSheldon: You told me not to call, and I didn\u2019t know how else to give you the good news. Fun with Flags is back, and you can be in the next episode.\nLeVar: Wil Wheaton said, get a gate. I don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t get a gate.\nSheldon: You, at least listen to the premise. Since you were born in Germany, I thought we could talk\nabout German flags. How do you feel about dressing up like a swastika?\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "1_14": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Well, this sandwich is an unmitigated disaster. I asked for turkey and roast beef with lettuce and swiss on wholewheat.\nRaj: What did they give you?\nSheldon: Turkey and roast beef with swiss and lettuce on wholewheat. It\u2019s the right ingredients but in the wrong order. In a proper sandwich the cheese is adjacent to the bread to create a moisture barrier against the lettuce. They might as well have dragged this thing through a car wash. \nLeonard: I don\u2019t believe it.\nSheldon: I know, it\u2019s basic culinary science. \nLeonard: Some guy is auctioning off a miniature time machine prop from the original film and no-one is bidding on it. \nHoward: A time machine from the movie The Time Machine? \nLeonard: No, a time machine from Sophie\u2019s Choice. \nRaj: Boy, Sophie could have used a time machine in that movie. Did you see it, it\u2019s rough. \nHoward: Oh, that\u2019s cool.\nLeonard: Uh-huh.\nRaj: It\u2019s only $800?\nLeonard: Yeah. And that\u2019s my bid.\nSheldon: You bid $800.\nLeonard: It was a spur of the moment thing, I figured it would go for thousands and I just wanted to be a part of it. \nSheldon: There\u2019s only 30 seconds left in the auction.\nHoward: Do you have $800?\nLeonard: Not to blow on a miniature time machine. \nHoward: Don\u2019t worry, the way these things work there\u2019s people waiting \u2018til the last second to bid, and then they swoop in and get it, it\u2019s called sniping.\nRaj: Fifteen seconds.\nLeonard: Come on, snipers. \nRaj: Ten, nine, eight\u2026\nLeonard: Where are your snipers?\nRaj: Five.\nLeonard: Snipe.\nRaj: Four.\nLeonard: Snipe. \nRaj: Three.\nLeonard: Snipe!\nRaj: Two.\nLeonard: SNIPE!\nRaj: One.\nLeonard: Aaaa-aw! \nRaj: Congratulations, you are the proud owner of a miniature time machine.\nHoward: You lucky duck. \nSheldon: I wonder why no-one else bid, this is a classic piece of sci-fi movie memorabilia. \nLeonard: Yeah, I know, I still can\u2019t afford it. \nHoward: Why don\u2019t we share it? We\u2019ll each put in two hundred bucks and we\u2019ll take turns having it in our homes.\nRaj: A time share time machine? I\u2019m in. Sheldon?\nSheldon: Need you ask? But I still don\u2019t understand why no-one else bid. \nScene: The lobby. The guys stand around a full sized time machine. \nSheldon: I understand why no-one else bid. \nCredits sequence\nScene: The same\nRaj: Did the listing actually say miniature?\nLeonard: I just assumed. Who sells a full sized time machine for $800?\nSheldon: In a venn diagram, that would be an individual located within the intersection of the sets \u201cno longer want my time machine\u201d and \u201cneed $800\u201d.\nHoward: It\u2019s actually a tremendous bargain, even with shipping it works out to less than four dollars a pound. \nRaj: Cocktain shrimp are $12.50.\nLeonard: How are we going to get it upstairs? \nHoward: If we take the dish off it might fit in the elevator. \nLeonard: Yes but the elevator\u2019s been broken for two years. \nSheldon: I\u2019ve been meaning to ask you, do you think we should make a call about that? \nHoward: Not necessary, I have a masters in engineering, I remotely repair satellites on a regular basis. I troubleshoot space shuttle payloads. When the Mars rover started pulling to the left I performed a front end alignment from 62 million miles away. (Presses lift button. Nothing happens.) No, that baby\u2019s broken. \nScene: The stairwell, approaching the apartment door. Leonard and Sheldon are pulling the time machine up the last part of the stairs.\nLeonard: Come on, guys, push. \nHoward (off): If I push any harder I\u2019m going to give birth to my colon. \nRaj (off): I can\u2019t feel my fingers, hurry up. \nSheldon: It\u2019s the same amount of work no matter how fast you go, basic physics.\nRaj: Sheldon?\nSheldon: Yeah. \nRaj: If my fingers ever work again, I\u2019ve got a job for the middle one. \nPenny (coming out of her apartment): Oh, hey guys.\nLeonard (letting go of time machine, as does Sheldon): Uh, hi Penny. (Raj and Howard are heard to scream as the time machine slides back down the stairs.) Take a break, guys! \nPenny: What are you doing?\nLeonard: Oh, just, you know, moving\u2026 something upstairs. \nPenny: What is it?\nLeonard: It\u2019s\u2026 you know, time machine. \nPenny: Yeah, okay, neat, but I really got to get to work, so\u2026.\nLeonard: Uh, just give us a few minutes.\nPenny: I don\u2019t have a few minutes, I\u2019m running really late.\nSheldon: Then I have a simple solution, go up to the roof, hop over to the next building, there\u2019s a small gap, don\u2019t look down if you\u2019re subject to vertigo, and use their stairwell. \nPenny: You\u2019re joking, right?\nSheldon: Oh, I never joke when it comes to vertigo. \nPenny: Damn, okay, I\u2019ll just take the roof. \nLeonard: Hey, if you wait for us to set up the time machine, I can drop you off at work yesterday. Time travel joke, it\u2019s not\u2026 never mind. \nSheldon: For what it\u2019s worth, I thought it was humorous. \nLeonard: Let\u2019s just do this. Guys, ready to push?\nRaj: In a minute. Howard stepped outside to throw up. \nScene: The living room. The time machine is set up.\nSheldon: I don\u2019t know what you were worried about. I think it really works in the room.\nLeonard: Yeah. It is by far the coolest thing I have ever owned. \nSheldon: The exact time machine that carried actor Rod Taylor from Victorian England into the post-apocalyptic future, which society had splintered into two factions, the sub-terranean Morlocks, who survived by feasting on the flesh of the gentle surface dwelling Eloy. \nHoward: Talk about your chick magnets. \nRaj: Oh yeah. The guy who lives next to me is always like, I have a Jacuzzi on my balcony, I have a Jacuzzi on my balcony. But wait until I tell him, I\u2019ve got a time machine on my balcony. Stuff that in your speedos, Jacuzzi Bob!\nSheldon: Gentlemen, I know we said we\u2019d take turns, but I think you\u2019d agree that practicality dictates it remain here. \nHoward: You can\u2019t just keep it here, what if I meet a girl and say, \u201cyou wanna come up and see my time machine, it\u2019s at my friends house,\u201d how lame is that? \nRaj: He\u2019s got a point.\nSheldon: Alright, I think we\u2019re going to need some ground rules, in addition to the expected no shoes in the time machine and no eating in the time machine, I propose that we add pants must be worn at all times in the time machine. \nLeonard: Seconded. \nHoward: I was going to put down a towel. \nRaj: I still want it on my balcony. I say we move it on a bi-monthly basis. \nLeonard: That sounds fair.\nSheldon: Hold on. Bi-monthly is an ambiguous term, do you mean move it every other month, or twice a month? \nRaj: Twice a month.\nSheldon: Then no. \nRaj: Okay, every other month.\nSheldon: No. \nLeonard: Sheldon, you can\u2019t be selfish, we all paid for it, so it belongs to all of us. Now out of the way so I can sit in my time machine. (Sits and turns it on. The three lights on the front illuminate. All let out an \u201coh\u201d.) Okay, I am setting the dials for March 10th, 1876. \nHoward: Good choice, Alexander Graham Bell invents the telephone and calls out for Dr Watson.\nSheldon: Wait a minute, I\u2019d want to see that too. \nLeonard: So, when it\u2019s your turn you can.\nSheldon: But if we all go back to the same point in time, Bell\u2019s lab is going to get very crowded, he\u2019ll know something\u2019s up. \nRaj: Also, since the time machine doesn\u2019t move in space, you\u2019ll end up in 1876 Pasadena. \nHoward: And even if you can make it to Boston, what are you going to do, knock on the door and say to Mrs Bell, \u201chey Mrs Bell, big fan of your husband, can I come in and watch him invent the telephone?\u201d\nRaj: Mrs Bell was deaf, she\u2019s not even going to hear you knock. \nSheldon: Oh, I have a solution, first go into the future and obtain a cloaking device.\nRaj: Ooh, how far into the future?\nSheldon: If I remember correctly, Captain Kirk will steal a cloaking device from the Romulans on Stardate 5027.3, which will be January 10th 2328 by pre-federation reckoning.\nLeonard: Okay, I am setting the dials for January 10th, 2328. Here we go into the future. (Pulls lever, the disk begins to spin. The other guys all run around the flat as if moving in fast motion.) That was fun. \nRaj: My turn.\nPenny (entering): Okay, first of all, what you call a gap was nearly three feet wide, I slipped and skinned my knee.\nLeonard: Are you okay?\nPenny: Zzz-zz-zz-zz! Second of all, the door to the stairwell of the other building was locked, so I had to go down the fire escape which ends on the third floor, forcing me to crawl through the window of a lovely Armenian family, who insisted I stay for lunch. \nLeonard: That doesn\u2019t sound too bad.\nPenny: It was eight courses of lamb, and they tried to fix me up with their son.\nLeonard: Sorry.\nPenny: Not done. By the time I finally got to work, they\u2019d given my shift away. Yeah, that\u2019s right, I\u2019ve lost an entire day\u2019s pay thanks to this\u2026 this\u2026\nSheldon: Time machine. \nLeonard: The lights flash and the dish spins, you wanna try it?\nPenny: No! I don\u2019t want to try it, my God, you are grown men, how could you waste your lives with these stupid toys and costumes and comic books and\u2026 and now that\u2026 that\u2026\nSheldon: Again, time machine. \nPenny: Oh please, it\u2019s not a time machine, if anything it looks like something Elton John would drive through the Everglades.\nSheldon: It only moves in time. It would be worse than useless in a swamp. \nPenny: Pathetic. All of you, completely pathetic. (Storms out. A beat, and then\u2026) \nRaj: My turn! \nScene: Later that night, Leonard is sitting in the time machine, turning the lights on and off. Sheldon enters.\nSheldon: Leonard, it\u2019s two in the morning. \nLeonard: So?\nSheldon: So it\u2019s my turn. Why did you set it for the day before yesterday?\nLeonard: Because I want to go back and keep myself from getting a time machine.\nSheldon: You can\u2019t. If you were to prevent yourself from buying it in the past, you would not have it available in the present to travel back and stop yourself from buying it, ergo you would still have it. This is a classic rookie time travel mistake. \nLeonard: Can I go back and prevent you from explaining that to me?\nSheldon: Same paradox. If you were to travel back in time and, say, knock me unconscious, you would not then have the conversation that irritated you, motivating you to go back and knock me unconscious. \nLeonard: What if I knocked you unconscious right now? \nSheldon: It won\u2019t change the past. \nLeonard: But it would make the present so much nicer. \nSheldon: Are you upset about something? \nLeonard: What was your first clue?\nSheldon: Well, it was a number of things. First the late hour, then your demeanour seems very low energy, plus your irritability\u2026\nLeonard: Yes I\u2019m upset. \nSheldon: Oh! I don\u2019t usually pick up on those things. Good for me. \nLeonard: Yeah, good for you. \nSheldon: Oh, wait. Did you want to talk about what\u2019s bothering you? \nLeonard: I don\u2019t know. Maybe.\nSheldon: Wow, I\u2019m on fire tonight. \nLeonard: Uh, here\u2019s the thing. Girls like Penny never end up with guys who own time machines. \nSheldon: I disagree. Your inability to successfully woo Penny long predates your acquisition of the time machine. That failure clearly stands on its own.\nLeonard: Thanks for pointing it out.\nSheldon: In addition, your premise is flawed. In the original film, Rod Taylor got Yvette Mimeaux with that very time machine. In Back to the Future, Marty McFly got the opportunity to hook up with his extremely attractive young mother. \nLeonard: Those are movies.\nSheldon: Well of course they\u2019re movies. Were you expecting me to come up with an example involving a real life time machine? That\u2019s absurd. \nScene: The stairwell. It is the previous day, and again Leonard and Sheldon are pulling the time machine up the stairs.\nLeonard: Come on, guys, push. \nHoward (off): If I push any harder I\u2019m going to give birth to my colon. \nPenny (coming out of her apartment): Oh, hey guys.\nLeonard (letting go of time machine, as does Sheldon): Uh, hi Penny. (Raj and Howard are heard to scream as the time machine slides back down the stairs.) Take a break, guys! \nPenny: What are you doing?\nLeonard: Oh, just, you know, moving a\u2026 time machine. \nPenny: Yeah, okay, neat, but I really got to get to work, so\u2026.\nLeonard: No problem. (Removes glasses, pulls down out of order tape from lift doors, and forces them open.) Hang on. (Takes Penny in his arms as he holds onto the lift cable.)\nPenny: But, what about your time machine.\nLeonard: Some things are more important than toys. (She puts her arms around his neck as he dangles from the cable.)\nPenny: Oh, I\u2019m scared. \nLeonard: Don\u2019t worry baby, I\u2019ve got you.\nPenny: Oh, Leonard. (Kisses him as they descend from view. Leonard wakes up still sitting in the time machine.)\nSheldon: It\u2019s still my turn.\nScene: The living room. \nSheldon: What are you doing?\nLeonard: I\u2019m packing up all my collectibles and taking them down to the comic book store to sell. \nSheldon: Well is that really necessary. If you need money you can always sell blood. And semen. \nLeonard: It\u2019s not about money.\nRaj (entering): We brought food.\nHoward: Lox and bagels, the breakfast of time travellers.\nLeonard: Terrific, does anyone want to buy my share of the time machine?\nRaj: Why?\nLeonard: Because I don\u2019t want it any more. \nHoward: Why?\nLeonard: Just\u2026 personal reasons. \nSheldon: My spidey-sense tells me this has something to do with Penny. \nLeonard: Look, do you want to buy me out or not?\nRaj: I\u2019ll give you a hundred dollars, which will make me half owner, and we\u2019ll put it on my balcony. \nHoward: Screw his balcony, I\u2019ll give you a hundred and twenty and we\u2019ll put it in my garage. \nLeonard: I paid two hundred dollars for my share.\nRaj: Dude, everyone knows a time machine loses half its value the minute you drive it off the lot.\nSheldon: I\u2019ll go for two hundred, that time machine stays right where it is. \nRaj: Three hundred, and I\u2019ll throw in my original 1979 Mattel Millenium Falcon with real light speed sound effects. \nLeonard: No, no more toys or action figures or props or replicas or costumes or robots or Darth Vader voice changers, I\u2019m getting rid of all of it. \nHoward: You can\u2019t do that, look what you\u2019ve created here, it\u2019s like nerdvana. \nRaj: More importantly, you\u2019ve a Darth Vader voice changer? \nLeonard: Not for long.\nRaj: Oh, I call dibs on the Golden Age Flash.\nHoward: Hang on, I need that to complete my Justice Society of America collection.\nRaj: Too bad, I called dibs.\nHoward: Well you can\u2019t just call dibs.\nRaj: I can and I did, look up dibs on Wikipedia.\nSheldon: Dibs doesn\u2019t apply in a bidding war. \nLeonard: It\u2019s not a bidding war, I\u2019m selling it all to Larry down at the comic book store. \nRaj: Why Larry? Did Larry call dibs? \nHoward: Will you forget dibs! \nLeonard: He offered me a fair price for the whole collection.\nSheldon: What\u2019s the number, I\u2019ll match it. \nRaj: I\u2019ll match it, plus a thousand rupees. \nSheldon: What\u2019s the exchange rate.\nRaj: None of your business. Take it or leave it.\nHoward (on phone): Mom, my bar-mizvah bonds, how much do I got? Thanks. I can go twenty six hundred dollars and two trees in Israel. \nLeonard: Forget it guys, if I sell to one of you, the other two are going to be really mad at me.\nSheldon: Who cares, as long as you pick me. \nRaj: Okay, Leonard, put down the box, let\u2019s talk.\nLeonard: Sorry Raj, my mind is made up.\nSheldon (moving to block his path): No. I can\u2019t let you do this. \nLeonard: Sheldon, get out of my way.\nSheldon (brandishing toy sword from Leonard\u2019s box): None shall pass. \nLeonard: Okay. I did not want to do this but, I have here the rare mint condition production error Star Trek: The Next Generation Geordi LaForge, without his visor in the original packaging. If you do not get out of my way, I will open it. \nHoward: Okay man, be cool, we\u2019re all friends here. \nPenny (coming out of her flat): What the hell\u2019s going on? \nSheldon: You hypocrite!\nPenny: What?\nSheldon: Little Miss \u201cgrown ups don\u2019t play with toys\u201d. If I were to go into that apartment right now, would I find Beanie Babies? Are you not an accumulator of Care Bears and My Little Ponies? And who is that Japanese feline I see frolicking on your shorts? Hello,Hello Kitty! \nPenny: Okay, okay look, if this is about yesterday, Leonard, I am really sorry about what I said, I was just a bit upset.\nLeonard: No, I needed to hear it.\nPenny: No you didn\u2019t. Look, you are a great guy, and it is things you love that make you who you are. \nHoward: I guess that makes me large breasts. \nLeonard: Still, I think it\u2019s time for me to get rid of this stuff and\u2026 you know\u2026 move on with my life. \nPenny: Really?\nLeonard: Yeah.\nPenny: Oh. Wow. Good for you. (Kisses his cheek.)\nLeonard: Thanks. Hey, do you want to, I don\u2019t know, later\u2026\nGood looking man coming up stairs: Excuse me. Hey, Penny!\nPenny: Hi Mike.\nMike: Are you ready to go. \nPenny: Yeah, I just have to change.\nMike: I\u2019ll give you a hand.\nPenny: Oh, stop it! Bye guys. \nLeonard (after a long pause): My turn on the time machine. \nScene: A jungle. As the camera moves, the time machine becomes visible. Sheldon is sitting in it The disk stops spinning, and he looks around. The dials read APR 28 802,701. \nSheldon: It worked. It really worked. They said I was mad, but it worked. (Large hairy creatures with glowing eyes emerge from the forest and walk towards him menacingly.) Oh no, not Morlocks! Not flesh-eating Morlocks! He-e-e-e-e-e-e-elp! (With a yelp, he wakes up in the time machine in the living room.) \nLeonard: Sheldon, are you okay? \nSheldon: We have to get rid of the time machine. \nLeonard: It is a little big for the living room, isn\u2019t it?\nSheldon: Yeah, that\u2019s the problem, it\u2019s too big. \nLeonard: I\u2019m glad you agree. I hired some guys to help us move it, come on in fellas. (A pair of Morlocks come through the door.)\nSheldon: Oh no, Morlocks? Eat him, eat him. Aaaaargh. (Sheldon wakes up in his own bed.) Leonard!!!!!!!!\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "5_1": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The Cafeteria\nSheldon: It\u2019s not what it looks like. It\u2019s not what it looks like.\nLeonard: What are you grinding about?\nSheldon: Penny\u2019s brain teaser this morning. She and Koothrappali emerge from your bedroom. She is dishevelled, and Raj is dressed only in a sheet. The sole clue, it\u2019s not what it looks like.\nLeonard: Just let it go, Sheldon.\nSheldon: If I could, I would, but I can\u2019t, so I shan\u2019t. Now, knowing Penny, the obvious answer is, they engaged in coitus. But, since that\u2019s what it looked like, we can rule that out. Let\u2019s put on our thinking cap, shall we? (Mimes doing so) Raj is from India, a tropical country. Third World hygiene. Parasitic infections are common, such as pinworms. Mm-hmm. The procedure for diagnosing pinworms is to wait until the subject is asleep, and the worms crawl out of the rectum for air. (Leonard spits out food) Yes, just like that. Penny could have been inspecting Raj\u2019s anal region for parasites. Oh, boy. That\u2019s a true blue friend.\nLeonard: They slept together, Sherlock.\nSheldon: No, you weren\u2019t listening. She said, it\u2019s not what it looks like.\nLeonard: She lied.\nSheldon: Oh. Well don\u2019t I look silly sitting here wearing this?\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The Cafeteria\nHoward: Hey.\nRaj: Hey.\nLeonard: Hey.\nSheldon: Hey. Leonard, is it awkward for you knowing that one of your dear friends had sexual intercourse with a woman you used to love in the very place you lay your head?\nLeonard: No, I\u2019m fine with it.\nSheldon: That sounds like sarcasm, but I\u2019m going to disregard it, because I have an agenda. Paintball. Specifically, the interdepartmental tournament this weekend. Now, in order to function better as a fighting unit, I thought we should establish a chain of command. Now, it goes without saying that I would outrank the three of you, but the question remains, by how much? Now, I don\u2019t see me as some four-star general, back at HQ riding a desk and playing golf with the Secretary of Defence. But I also can\u2019t be Sergeant Cooper, because that might lead you to think of me as just a regular Joe. This might take some thought. As you were.\nLeonard: What the hell is wrong with you?\nHoward: Yeah, how could you do that?\nRaj: What is it to you?\nHoward: I got his back.\nRaj: Yeah, right. You\u2019re just jealous because it turns out I\u2019m Penny\u2019s number two choice after Leonard.\nHoward: Hey, if I wasn\u2019t engaged to Bernadette, that totally could have been me.\nLeonard: Please. Sheldon would have been before you, and he might not even have genitals.\nRaj: Why do you care so much? You\u2019re dating my sister, and Penny and I are in love.\nLeonard and Howard together: What?\nSheldon: Gentlemen, if I may interject, I\u2019ve decided my rank will be captain. If it\u2019s good enough for Kirk, Crunch and Kangaroo, it\u2019s good enough for me.\nHoward: You\u2019re not in love with Penny.\nRaj: Yes, I am. The god Kamadeva has shot us with his flowery arrows of love.\nHoward: Who?\nRaj: He\u2019s the Hindu version of Cupid, but way better, because he rides a giant parrot.\nLeonard: Raj, come on. You fall in love with any girl who smiles at you. A month ago, you were writing poems about his fiancee.\nHoward: I\u2019m sorry. What?\nRaj: Rubbish. He\u2019s talking rubbish.\nLeonard: Oh, Bernadette, please play my clarinet.\nRaj: That could have been about anyone. Besides, you have nothing to worry about, because now I\u2019m the dusky half of Koothrapenny.\nSheldon: For the record, I do have genitals. They\u2019re functional and aesthetically pleasing.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment. Penny has a bottle of wine. She can\u2019t find a glass. Finds a measuring jug and uses that instead. There is a knock on the door.\nPenny: Coming. Yup, that\u2019s good. Wine glasses should have handles.\nAmy: Keeping accurate track of your alcohol intake. Smart idea considering how trampy you get when you\u2019ve had a few.\nPenny: You heard what I did?\nAmy: Well, I heard who you did.\nPenny: Oh, my God, I screwed up everything. I hurt Leonard, I hurt Raj, I mean, what is wrong with me? I feel like two totally different people, Dr. Jekyll and Mrs. Whore.\nAmy: Don\u2019t be so hard on yourself. Do you know the story of Catherine the Great?\nPenny: No.\nAmy: She ruled Russia in the late seventeen hundreds, and one night, when she was feeling particularly randy, she used an intricate system of pulleys to have intimate relations with a horse.\nPenny: I\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m sorry. What does this have to do with me?\nAmy: She engaged in interspecies hanky-panky, and people still call her great. I\u2019m sure your reputation can survive you shagging a little Indian boy.\nScene: Raj\u2019s apartment. There is a knock on the door. He opens it.\nBernadette: You jerk face! What did you tell Howard? Did you say there was something going on between us? Because he thinks there is. He\u2019s completely freaking out!\nRaj: Please, come in.\nBernadette: What the hell is wrong with you?\nRaj: Well, you were always so nice to me, I thought maybe you liked me.\nBernadette: I\u2019m nice to everyone.\nRaj: I\u2019m sorry.\nBernadette: Damn right, you\u2019re sorry. And you tell Howard there\u2019s never been anything between us.\nRaj: I will. Hey, Bernadette?\nBernadette: What?!\nRaj: Do you think I have a shot with Penny?\nBernadette: Of course you do. You\u2019re a cutie pie. Any girl would be lucky to have you.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment.\nPenny: You know, I\u2019ve done this before. In kindergarten, I was supposed to marry Jason Sorensen at recess, but by the time my class got out there, he was already engaged to Chelsea Himmelfarb. So what did I do? Hung upside down from the monkey bars, let all the boys see my underpants.\nAmy: You can\u2019t blame yourself. When your prefrontal cortex fails to make you happy, promiscuity rewards you with the needed flood of dopamine. We neurobiologists refer to this as the skank reflex.\nPenny: You know what? Let\u2019s get out of here.\nAmy: Where are we going?\nPenny: Somewhere where no one\u2019s seen me naked. We may have to drive awhile. (Opens door. Sees Leonard and Sheldon. Slams it shut again.)\nSheldon: Subtlety isn\u2019t her strong suit, is it?\nPenny: Can I stay at your place for a few nights?\nAmy: Really? A best friend sleepover? Yay.\nPenny: Yeah, sure. Yay!\nAmy: We\u2019ll make popcorn, stay up all night and I\u2019ll teach you my secret language, Op.\nPenny: Sounds great.\nAmy: Nope. Sounds Gop Rop E A Top.\nPenny: Yeah, I\u2019m gonna go pack a bag.\nAmy: No, you\u2019re not. You\u2019re gonna Pop A Cop Kop A Bop A Gop.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: Do we really have to wear this camouflage crap to play paintball?\nSheldon: Who said that? Leonard, I can hear your voice, but I can\u2019t see you.\nLeonard: I\u2019m not in the mood, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Oh, there you are. Leonard, I know you\u2019re upset about recent events, and I have someone here to help. (Showing laptop screen)\nLeonard: I don\u2019t want to talk to Amy.\nSheldon: No, it\u2019s not Amy.\nDr Hofstadter: Hello, dear.\nLeonard: You called my mother?\nSheldon: Oh, Leonard, is it really necessary to caption the obvious?\nDr Hofstadter: He\u2019s been like that since he was a toddler. Look, Mommy, a butterfly. Maddening.\nLeonard: What\u2019s going on? What do you want?\nDr Hofstadter: Sheldon informed me that you\u2019re experiencing an emotional upheaval, and I\u2019m here to help.\nLeonard: That\u2019s so nice.\nDr Hofstadter: And we\u2019re back to the obvious. Now, what\u2019s up?\nLeonard: Well, uh, okay, um, I don\u2019t want to get back together with Penny. We tried it, it was crazy, it didn\u2019t work, but I can\u2019t deal with the fact that she slept with my friend Raj. And then I find out that Raj\u2019s sister Priya, who I\u2019ve been going out with for eight months, is moving back to India. So I\u2019m just completely confused and alone.\nDr Hofstadter: I understand.\nLeonard: Got any advice?\nDr Hofstadter: Yes. Buck up.\nLeonard: Excuse me. You\u2019re a world-renowned expert in parenting and child development, and all you\u2019ve got is buck up?\nDr Hofstadter: Sorry. Buck up, sissy pants.\nLeonard: Thanks, Mother. I feel much better.\nDr Hofstadter: If you need any more help from me, my books are available on Amazon. Logging off.\nScene: Amy\u2019s apartment. Amy is brushing Penny\u2019s hair.\nAmy: Ninety-nine, one hundred. It\u2019s like a waterfall of liquid gold. My turn.\nPenny: You know, I don\u2019t even know what the point of me staying in L.A. is. I haven\u2019t gotten a single acting job since I moved out here. The closest I came was last month, I got a callback for a hemorrhoid commercial.\nAmy: Oh, I could so see you being the face of haemorrhoids.\nPenny: I know, right? Maybe I should just move back to Nebraska.\nAmy: No, I can\u2019t let you do that.\nPenny: Why not? (There is a knock on the door)\nAmy: For the first time ever, I have a thriving social life. And no pressure, but it kind of lives and dies with you.\nRaj: Hi, Amy. Can I talk to Penny?\nAmy: A guest in my trundle bed and a boy at my door? I wish I could tell 13-year-old me it does get better.\nPenny: How did you know I was here?\nRaj: It\u2019s all over her Facebook page.\nAmy: I\u2019ll take your stuff to the bedroom and clear out a drawer.\nPenny: Thanks.\nAmy: No problem. Try and keep it in your pants, okay?\nPenny: So, hi. What\u2019s up?\nRaj: I was wondering if you\u2019re free Friday. They\u2019re having a Totally \u201980s Night at the Greek. Hall & Oates, Katrina and the Waves and three-fifths of Kajagoogoo.\nPenny: Oh. Gee, that\u2019s really sweet, but the thing is\u2026\nRaj: Aw, there\u2019s a thing.\nPenny: Look, honey, I was really drunk and made a huge mistake last night. We should\u2019ve never slept together. It\u2019s what ruins friendships.\nRaj: You can\u2019t ruin a friendship with sex. That\u2019s like trying to ruin ice cream with chocolate sprinkles.\nPenny: Come here. Just listen to me. I want to go back to the way we were before. You know, friends. No sprinkles.\nRaj: Oh. All right.\nPenny: Thank you.\nRaj: Well, uh, as your friend, you might like to know that, um, we didn\u2019t have sex in the conventional sense.\nPenny: Oh, God. Did you pull some weird Indian crap on me?\nRaj: No, no. After we got undressed and jumped in bed, you, you asked if I had protection.\nPenny: Oh, you did, didn\u2019t you?\nRaj: Of course. I\u2019m always packing. Anyway, um, I had trouble putting it on and you tried to help and, that was all she wrote.\nPenny: So, we didn\u2019t actually\u2026\nRaj: I did. It was beautiful.\nPenny: Oh!\nRaj: Penny, please, please promise me you won\u2019t tell anybody about this.\nPenny: Of course I won\u2019t. No, I won\u2019t.\nRaj: Oh, good. Um, can I tell people that our love burned too bright and too quickly? Kind of a Candle in the Wind deal?\nPenny: Sure.\nRaj: Cool. Can I say it fell apart because you were all, I want to have your babies, and I was like, I\u2019m too rock and roll to be tied down?\nPenny: No.\nRaj: Can I say I ruined you for white men?\nPenny: Also no.\nRaj: Okay, just the candle thing.\nPenny: Yeah.\nRaj: Cool. All right friend.\nPenny: Hmm.\nRaj: I\u2019ll see you around.\nPenny: Okay. Raj, wait. Thank you for being my friend. (She hugs him.)\nRaj: Penny?\nPenny: Mm-hmm?\nRaj: It\u2019s getting beautiful again.\nScene: A shed on the paintball range.\nSheldon: All right, this is a Google Earth view of the field of battle.\nHoward: I don\u2019t see anything.\nSheldon: Give it a second to load. Whenever you\u2019re ready, AT&T! Okay, here we go. This is us here. To the south is Professor Loomis and the Geology Department. According to their Twitter feed, they\u2019re out of sunblock, which means they\u2019ll have to hug the tree line or risk melanoma. That\u2019s our edge. All we have to do is move quickly over this ridge, the rock-worshipping pasty-faced bastards won\u2019t know what hit them. All right, let\u2019s move out.\nLeonard: Hang on, Sheldon. How could you not tell me your sister was moving back to India?\nHoward: Maybe he was too busy writing clumsy penis metaphors about my fiancee.\nRaj: Screw you. That was a beautifully written penis metaphor.\nLeonard: You know what, guys, I\u2019m not in the mood for paintball. What do you say we just bag it?\nHoward: Fine with me.\nRaj: Sure, whatever.\nSheldon: You can\u2019t quit. That\u2019s a court-martial offence. That\u2019s punishable by\u2026 You can\u2019t quit.\nLeonard: Sorry, Sheldon, it\u2019s just not a good time for playing games.\nSheldon: This is a game to you? Uh, was the Battle of Antietam a game? Huh? Was the sack of Rome a game?\nLeonard: Yes, no and no.\nSheldon: Wait. I just want you all to know that I forgive you. This mutiny isn\u2019t your fault, it\u2019s mine. I haven\u2019t earned these bars. Although what I lack in leadership, apparently I more than make up for in sewing.\nHoward: Let it go, Sheldon. I\u2019ll get you a Jamba Juice on the way home.\nSheldon: No. Jamba Juice is for heroes. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to be.\nLeonard: What are you doing?\nSheldon: Following in the footsteps of Kirk, Crunch and Kangaroo. (Walks outside) Geology isn\u2019t a real science! (Gets hit by countless paintball pellets)\nHoward: Damn those sons of bitches!\nLeonard: Let\u2019s get \u2019em!\nSheldon: If there\u2019s ever a Church of Sheldon, this will be when it started. Ow!\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: I\u2019d like to propose a toast to the man whose noble sacrifice inspired our victory, Captain Sheldon Cooper.\nHoward and Raj: Here, here.\nSheldon: Excuse me. It\u2019s Major Sheldon Cooper. With my last breath, I awarded myself a battlefield promotion. It\u2019s kind of a big deal.\nPenny: Hi. You guys have a minute?\nLeonard: Uh, yeah, sure.\nPenny: Okay. Um. Well, I already talked to Raj, but I wanted to apologize to the rest of you for, you know, everything.\nRaj: Please, Penny, let me. We\u2019ve decided to let our crazy, wonderful night together be just one of those memories you have and can call to mind when you\u2019re feeling blue or you\u2019re in the shower.\nPenny: Hey, what you doing, Quick Draw?\nRaj: Sorry. Go on.\nPenny: Anyways, I wanted you guys all to know that I\u2019ve been taking a really hard look at things and come to the conclusion I have to stop kidding myself. I suck at acting. It\u2019s time for me to move back to Nebraska.\nLeonard: You\u2019re leaving?\nPenny: Yeah.\nHoward: What are you going to do in Nebraska?\nPenny: I don\u2019t know, maybe teach acting. (Phone rings) Oh, sorry. Hold on. Hello?\nLeonard: Penny, Penny, listen, I hope you\u2019re not doing this \u2019cause of you and me, because I have a girlfriend, and you\u2019re a single woman.\nPenny: Shh! It\u2019s my agent, it\u2019s my agent. You\u2019re kidding. Oh, my gosh. I can\u2019t believe it! Really? Oh, I\u2019m so excited, thank you, thank you so much. Okay, bye. I got the haemorrhoid commercial! I start Monday.\nSheldon: What about Nebraska?\nPenny: Oh, hell with Nebraska. I\u2019m gonna be a star!\nSheldon (to Leonard): Have you ever thought of teaching physics?\nScene: The apartment. Penny\u2019s ad is on the television. She is at a stables.\nActress: Ready to ride?\nPenny (on screen): I don\u2019t think so, Mom. Not today.\nActress: Oh, sweetie. Haemorrhoids acting up again?\nPenny (on screen): You don\u2019t know the half of it.\nActress: Oh, yes, I do. Try a dab of this.\nPenny (on screen): Rose-scented Preparation-H for women?\nActress: Now, the H is for Her.\nLeonard: I\u2019m proud of you.\nPenny: Shh! Here comes my joke.\nActress: How are you doing?\nPenny (on screen): Sittin\u2019 pretty.\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "3_12": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: Look at us. Getting ready for a double date with actual women who publicly acknowledge they\u2019re our girlfriends.\nHoward: Yes, actual women are the best.\nSheldon: I don\u2019t understand. What other kind of women are there?\nLeonard: Howard, artificial women are your department. You want to take this?\nHoward: No, it would just freak him out. Listen, before we leave, I should warn you, I\u2019m a passionate man and I tend towards public displays of affection.\nLeonard: What are you trying to tell me, Howard?\nHoward: There might be some making out in the car or the restaurant, and I don\u2019t want Bernadette to feel uncomfortable, so it would help if you and Penny made out, too.\nLeonard: Don\u2019t worry. We\u2019re planning to have sex right on the salad bar.\nRaj (arriving): Namaste, white people. Good news! I rented us the four-hour edition of Watchmen.\nLeonard: Got it.\nHoward: Seen it.\nSheldon: Detailed analysis posted online.\nRaj: Well, then what are we going to do tonight?\nLeonard: Uh, sorry, Raj. Howard and I are going out to dinner with Penny and Bernadette.\nHoward: Yeah, no more carefree bachelor nights for me and Leonard. These broncos have been saddled.\nLeonard: How did we get actual women?\nRaj: Great. They get girlfriends, and they just abandon us?\nSheldon: It is great, isn\u2019t it? We have a wonderful evening ahead of us.\nRaj: We do?\nSheldon: Oh, yes. I just discovered I don\u2019t have enough room on my hard drive for a Linux partition, so you and I are going to perform a full backup, reinitialize and then reinstall all my operating systems.\nRaj: I don\u2019t want to do that.\nSheldon: All right. Well, I\u2019m going to perform full backup, reinitialize and then reinstall all my operating systems.\nRaj: What about me?\nSheldon: Well, I understand there are several types of artificial women. Maybe you should look into that.\nCredits sequence. \nScene: A little later.\nRaj: Dude, there\u2019s so many cool things we could be doing tonight. Look. At the Glendale Galleria, put on your best zoot suit, it\u2019s a salute to Swing music in the center court near Macy\u2019s. 5pm to 9pm, huh, huh? A salute to zoot. Sounds like a hoot.\nSheldon: I\u2019m sorry, Raj, I have no desire to salute any article of clothing tonight. Much less one that\u2019s linked to race riots in the 1940s.\nRaj: Race riots?\nSheldon: The zoot suit riots.\nRaj: Oh. I always thought that was some sort of after-Christmas sale. Well, then why don\u2019t we just go to the galleria and walk around?\nSheldon: I don\u2019t need anything at the Galleria. Do you need anything at the Galleria?\nRaj: No. We would just walk around and see what\u2019s what.\nSheldon: That\u2019s a semantically null sentence.\nRaj: Okay, well, how about this? From the university Web site, 7pm to 10pm, Norton Hall Multipurpose Room, mixer for grad students and faculty of the science and humanities departments. Whether you split atoms or infinitives, this is the place to be.\nSheldon: Well, that\u2019s certainly amusing, but I have no interest.\nRaj: Come on, Sheldon, the world is filled with people doing things outside. Let\u2019s go outside. Outside is good.\nSheldon: If outside is so good, why has mankind spent thousands of years trying to perfect inside?\nRaj: I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s a marketing scheme. Please, Sheldon, I\u2019m a young, virile visitor from a foreign land and I need to strut my stuff.\nSheldon: Let me offer you a compromise. Sometimes when I feel stifled and want a change of scenery, I use my imagination.\nRaj: Oh, boy.\nSheldon: One of my favourite places to visit is the two-dimensional world described in Edwin Abbott\u2019s mathematical fantasy, Flatland.\nRaj: I don\u2019t want to go to Flatland.\nSheldon: You\u2019re only saying that because you haven\u2019t been there. I am now a hexagon in two-dimensional space and can only perceive the edges of other objects.\nRaj: Oy.\nSheldon: Is that you, Raj? I don\u2019t recognize your edge.\nRaj: Sheldon, I\u2019m begging you. I want to go to this mixer, and I don\u2019t want to go alone.\nSheldon: Well, you\u2019re in luck, there\u2019s a mixer here in Flatland. Oh, look, there\u2019s a sexually attractive line segment, you should chat her up.\nRaj: What?\nSheldon: Tell her you\u2019re a circle, Flatland gals are all hot for circles.\nScene: Leonard\u2019s car.\nLeonard: I hope you\u2019re hungry, Bernadette, we\u2019re going to a terrific restaurant.\nBernadette: Oh, yeah, I\u2019m starved. When you spend all day in a bio-lab, watching flesh-eating bacteria skeletonize small rodents it really works up an appetite.\nHoward: Flesh-eating bacteria. And yet, I still want to kiss this woman, what does that tell you?\nPenny: That you\u2019d be willing to die a horrible death on the off-chance you\u2019d get to second base?\nBernadette: Oh, we\u2019re way past second base. Right, Howard?\nHoward: Well, we kind of disagree about what the bases are.\nBernadette: How\u2019s your work going, Penny? Any acting jobs?\nPenny: Well, the last big thing I did was this production of Diary of Anne Frank above a bowling alley. But I think things might be turning around pretty soon.\nLeonard: Great. How come?\nPenny: Well, promise you won\u2019t make fun of me.\nLeonard: Of course, I would never make fun of you.\nPenny: Okay. Well, I went to this psychic who told me that if I cut my hair, I\u2019m going to get a national commercial.\nLeonard (laughing): Seriously? You\u2019re getting career advice from a psychic?\nHoward: Good job not making fun of her.\nPenny: She\u2019s not one of those phonies, okay. She wrote a book and has her own Web site.\nLeonard: Oh, gee, why didn\u2019t you say so? They don\u2019t let just anyone have a Web site.\nPenny: Why are you being such a jerk?\nLeonard: You\u2019re surprised? Your psychic didn\u2019t tell you I was going to be a jerk?\nPenny: Ha-ha, bite me.\nLeonard: Come on, Penny.\nHoward: Why don\u2019t you kids go ahead and chat? We\u2019re gonna make out back here.\nBernadette: I\u2019m sliding into third.\nScene: The university mixer.\nRaj: Thanks for coming with me.\nSheldon: Thanks for giving me your limited edition Green Lantern lantern.\nRaj: Did you really have to bring it in with you?\nSheldon: What if evil strikes and my power ring runs low?\nRaj: Come on, let\u2019s get a drink.\nSheldon: I don\u2019t drink.\nRaj: Yeah, well I do. And when my wingman is carrying a Green Lantern lantern, I drink a lot. I\u2019ll have a screwdriver, please. Don\u2019t be chintzy with the screw.\nSheldon: I would like a root beer float.\nRaj: Sheldon, they don\u2019t have ice cream.\nSheldon: They don\u2019t? Well, apparently, these people and I differ greatly on the definition of party.\nRaj: He\u2019ll have a Shirley Temple.\nSheldon: And don\u2019t be chintzy with the Shirley.\nRaj: Okay, let\u2019s check out the females.\nSheldon: All right. There\u2019s a female.\nRaj: That\u2019s Professor Wilkinson\u2019s wife, she\u2019s like 80 years old.\nSheldon: But she\u2019s female. Isn\u2019t that the game?\nRaj: No. I\u2019m looking for a hookup.\nSheldon: Oh, yes. So, the point of this exercise is for you to find someone to copulate with?\nRaj: Not so loud, but ideally, yes. Thanks.\nSheldon: Thank you. And what is my function as wingman?\nRaj: You help me run my game.\nSheldon: Okay. What is your game?\nSheldon: When I lie through my teeth to a woman, you nod and agree.\nGirl: Hey, that\u2019s pretty cool. What is it?\nSheldon: It\u2019s a limited edition Green Lantern lantern. My friend is looking for someone to copulate with.\nGirl: You\u2019re very funny. I\u2019m Abby.\nSheldon: I\u2019m Sheldon. How do you do?\nRaj: How do you do? Rajesh Ramayan Koothrappali. Call me Raj.\nAbby: Hi, Raj. Where are you from?\nRaj: The mysterious subcontinent of India.\nAbby: Ooh, India.\nRaj: You know India?\nAbby: I saw Slumdog Millionaire.\nRaj: Well, I\u2019m a slumdog astrophysicist.\nSheldon: I thought your father was a gynaecologist. I\u2019m sorry. (Smiles and nods)\nAbby: Martha, come here. Meet Raj and Sheldon. This is my friend, Martha.\nMartha: Hi.\nRaj: Hello.\nSheldon: Hello.\nMartha: Is that the limited edition Green Lantern lantern?\nSheldon: In brightest day, in darkest night, no evil shall escape my sight.\nMartha: Oh, that is so awesome.\nSheldon: Thank you. Have you chosen one to copulate with?\nScene: A restaurant.\nBernadette: So, what should we talk about?\nHoward: Well, we could always learn more about why people who believe in psychics are idiots. Leonard?\nPenny: Oh, we don\u2019t need to talk about that anymore. Leonard covered it pretty well in the car.\nLeonard: I\u2019m sorry, but facts are facts.\nPenny: Right, and if you can\u2019t understand it, it\u2019s not a fact.\nLeonard: No, if it\u2019s not a fact, it\u2019s not a fact.\nPenny: Oh, got it. Thank you for educating me.\nLeonard: You\u2019re welcome. How\u2019s your fish?\nPenny: Amazing. Would you like to try some?\nLeonard: Yeah, sure.\nPenny: Well, the fact is, you can\u2019t.\nLeonard: Come on, Howard, Bernadette, you\u2019re both scientists. Help me out here.\nHoward: What do you think? Want to jump right into the middle of another couple\u2019s argument?\nBernadette: No, thank you.\nHoward: Sorry.\nLeonard: Maybe we should just stop talking about this.\nPenny: Maybe some of us should stop talking altogether.\nWaiter: How is everything tonight?\nBernadette: Really uncomfortable.\nScene: The stairwell.\nLeonard: You know, the best thing about being in a committed, monogamous, mutually supportive relationship is that even if you have different ideas, you can have a spirited debate, yet still care for, even make love with\u2026 (she shuts the door in his face) Want your fish? (Opens door, takes fish, closes it again) I knew you were going to do that. Doesn\u2019t make me psychic! Attaboy, Leonard, make it worse. (Opens his own apartment door to find Sheldon, Raj and the two girls playing Rock Band and performing American Woman)\nLeonard: What\u2019s going on?\nSheldon: We scored. I\u2019m the wingman.\n \nScene: Leonard\u2019s lab.\nHoward: Hey.\nLeonard (handing him protective glasses): Laser.\nHoward: Had a great night last night. I don\u2019t like to kiss and tell, but somebody made it to eighth base.\nLeonard: What the hell is eighth base?\nHoward: Seventh base with shirt off. Well, my shirt. How\u2019d things go with Penny?\nLeonard: Oh, couldn\u2019t be better.\nHoward: Are we taking our relationship frustrations out on innocent Cylons?\nLeonard: It\u2019s not just Cylons. Superman\u2019s next.\nHoward: All right, I was going to try to squeeze in a little more mocking before lunch, but I can come back later when you don\u2019t have a high-powered weapon.\nLeonard: How can I go out with a woman who believes in psychics?\nHoward: Hey, I once dated a girl who believed she was abducted by aliens.\nLeonard: And that didn\u2019t bother you?\nHoward: Au contraire. It meant she was gullible and open to a little probing.\nLeonard: What am I supposed to do, pretend I believe something I don\u2019t whenever I\u2019m with Penny?\nHoward: Hey, I\u2019m sure Penny fakes all kinds of things when she\u2019s with you.\nLeonard: Do me a favour, lean over, put your head right here.\nHoward: Let me show you another way to look at this. Here we have the universe of all women. These are the ones you want to sleep with. These are the women who believe exactly what you believe. These are the women who would be willing to sleep with you. And right there in the\nlittle triple intersection is your ideal mate. Odds are she\u2019s a short physicist with low self-esteem who lives in a government research facility in China.\nLeonard: What\u2019s your point? In order to keep having a sexual relationship with Penny, I have to give up everything I believe in, my intellectual integrity, the very nature of who I am? I can\u2019t do that, Howard.\nHoward: I respect that. (Takes Leonard\u2019s hand, draws a dot on it.) \nLeonard: What is that?\nHoward: Your new girlfriend. Have fun tonight.\nScene: The apartment. Sheldon is learning Finnish. \nSheldon: The dog\u2026 koira. The roof\u2026 katto. Grapes\u2026 ryp leet. (There is a knock on the door) One minute. Sis\u00a0 n.\nRaj: What was that?\nSheldon: It means come in. It\u2019s taking forever to load the new operating system on my computer. I disinfected the kitchen and the bathroom, and now I thought I\u2019d learn Finnish.\nRaj: \u091c\u094b \u092d\u0940 \u0924\u0941\u092e\u094d\u0939\u093e\u0930\u0947 \u0928\u093e\u0935 \u092e\u0902\u0917\u093e\u0908. That\u2019s Hindi for whatever floats your boat. Uh, listen, I got a text from that girl Abby, and she and her friend Martha want to hang out with us again. What do you say?\nSheldon: I don\u2019t say anything. I merely offer you a facial expression that suggests you\u2019ve gone insane.\nRaj: I don\u2019t get it. You had a great time.\nSheldon: Yes, exactly, I had a great time. That\u2019s done, I\u2019ve moved on to other things. For example, after I learn Finnish, I\u2019m not going to learn Finnish again.\nRaj: Please, Sheldon, I\u2019m a lost Indian boy far from home, and I want a girlfriend and I want her to be Abby, and she\u2019ll only come over if she can bring Martha.\nSheldon: Raj, I highly doubt there is any argument you can make, threat you might levy, rhetorical strategy, plea, invocation, supplication, or\u2026 vetoomus that you can employ that would convince me to reconsider.\nRaj: My Incredible Hulk hands signed by Stan Lee.\nSheldon: Oh, my. I\u2019ve admired these for years.\nRaj: So does that mean we can go with the girls again?\nSheldon: Hulk agree to second date with puny humans!\nRaj: You can\u2019t wear the hands on the date.\nSheldon: Hulk sad.\nScene: The laundry room.\nLeonard: Hey. Cleaning out the old dryer lint, huh? Not only is it courteous, it\u2019s safety smart. Every year, 15,000 fires are caused by accidental dryer lint ignition. Now you\u2019re supposed to say, wow, what an interesting fact. Come here, you crazy, nerdy guy. I could never be mad at you.\nPenny: Wow, that\u2019s all you got after you were the most obnoxious person on a double date that included Howard Wolowitz?\nLeonard: No, I\u2019m sorry. I really am. It\u2019s not right to mock what a person believes in.\nPenny: Thank you. Would you be willing to go to my psychic and see what it\u2019s all about?\nLeonard: Would you be willing to read a book that concisely explains how all psychics are frauds?\nPenny: I would not.\nLeonard: Okay, let\u2019s go see your psychic.\nPenny: Really?\nLeonard: Well, yeah, one of us has to keep an open mind.\nPenny: You saying I don\u2019t have an open mind?\nLeonard: No, not at all. Let me help you with this stuff.\nPenny: You know, I believe in ghosts, too.\nLeonard: Great.\nPenny: And astrology.\nLeonard: I know, and pyramid power and healing crystals.\nPenny: Oh, no, no, no, crystals don\u2019t work.\nLeonard: Really, that\u2019s the line? Psychics are real, but crystals are voodoo?\nPenny: Oh, voodoo\u2019s real. You don\u2019t want to mess with voodoo.\nScene: The apartment.\nMartha: Flatland is more than just a mathematical essay. It is also a treatise on Victorian social mores.\nSheldon: You know, I had never considered that. Wow, that\u2019s going to completely change my visits there. Well, it\u2019s late.\nMartha: Uh-huh.\nSheldon: Time for bed.\nMartha: Okay.\nSheldon: Good night, puny human! (He gets up and leaves).\nScene: Outside Sheldon\u2019s bedroom.\nMartha: Sheldon?\nSheldon: Yes?\nMartha: Listen, they\u2019re kind of getting busy in the living room, and I was wondering if I could hang out in here for a while.\nSheldon: Well, I suppose. Come in. I\u2019ll sleep in Leonard\u2019s room. Good night.\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "5_9": "\n\t\t\t\t Scene: The lobby.\nPenny: Hey.\nLeonard: Oh, hey. You work the lunch shift?\nPenny: Yeah. I\u2019ve got eight pounds of salmon that\u2019s about to go bad. Do you know how to cook it?\nLeonard: Not really.\nPenny: Damn it. Should have liberated the iffy chicken. What are you and Professor Fussyface up to tonight?\nLeonard: Star Wars on Blu-ray.\nPenny: Haven\u2019t you seen that movie, like, a thousand times?\nLeonard: Not on Blu-ray. Only twice on Blu-ray.\nPenny: Oh, Leonard.\nLeonard: I know, it\u2019s high-resolution sadness.\nPenny: Well, I\u2019m going to take myself out to a movie tonight. You want to go?\nLeonard: Really? Do we do that?\nPenny: What do you mean?\nLeonard: You know, we haven\u2019t spent time alone together since we broke up.\nPenny: Oh, it\u2019s not a date, Leonard. It\u2019s just a man and a woman hanging out, and not having sex at the end of the night.\nLeonard: Sounds like most of my dates.\nSheldon (off, voice heard through apartment door as they approach): Oh, dear Lord, get away from me, you monster!\nPenny: What is that about?\nLeonard: Well, he\u2019s smart and crazy enough, he may have actually created a monster. (They enter. Sheldon is by the window.)\nSheldon: Shoo, shoo! Be gone!\nLeonard: What the hell is going on?\nSheldon: There\u2019s a bird outside the window, and he won\u2019t go away. That is the hell that is going on. We have no worms or seeds here. Shoo, shoo.\nPenny: Really? On top of everything else, you\u2019re afraid of birds?\nSheldon: It\u2019s called ornithophobia. And someday it will be recognized as a true disability, and the landlord will be required by law to put a giant net over the building. Which is unfortunate, because I have a fear of nets.\nPenny: So movies, yes or no?\nLeonard: Movies, yes.\nPenny: Great. I\u2019ll see you later. And remember, he\u2019s more afraid of you than you are of him.\nSheldon: That doesn\u2019t help.\nPenny: No, I was talking to the bird.\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Go away, bird. (Knock, knock, knock) Go away, bird. (Knock, knock, knock) Go away, bird.\nLeonard: Sheldon, just ignore him.\nSheldon: Good idea. Attention is what birds want. (Pulls curtain) Oh, much better. All right. Now I\u2019ll just get along with my life. (Bird squawks) Make a pot of tea, Leonard. It\u2019s going to be a long night.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The apartment.Sheldon is trying to scare the bird away making cat noises.\nLeonard: The bird\u2019s still there?\nSheldon: Quick, what does a hawk sound like?\nLeonard: I don\u2019t know. Scree-scree.\nSheldon: Please, that\u2019s a seagull. If you\u2019re not going to help, don\u2019t help.\nLeonard: Sorry. Do you think I\u2019m overdressed?\nSheldon: It depends on the activity. For a prostate exam, yes. If you\u2019re playing Vegas, I\u2019d add sequins.\nLeonard: I\u2019m going to the movies with Penny. I don\u2019t want her to think that I think it\u2019s a date.\nSheldon: Do you think it\u2019s a date?\nLeonard: No, but she might think I think it\u2019s a date even though I don\u2019t.\nSheldon: Or you might think she thinks you think it\u2019s a date even though she doesn\u2019t.\nLeonard: Are we overthinking this?\nSheldon: Not at all.\nLeonard: You\u2019re right. I\u2019m fine. I\u2019m wearing this.\nSheldon: Really? A blazer? All right. (Leonard takes off blazer and heads back to his room. Sheldon dials phone) Yes, hello. This is Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Yeah, I\u2019m at 2311 North Robles Avenue. Yeah, I\u2019d like to report a dangerous wild animal. A blue jay. I\u2019m sorry, this is Animal Control. I don\u2019t understand the laughter. No, the bird is not in my home. If he was in my home, I obviously would have called 911. Sir, I have no doubt that there are things that you\u2019re frightened of. Being stuck in a dead-end public service job? Or your wife stepping out on you because you\u2019re stuck in a dead-end public service job? Or spiders? Don\u2019t you think I tried making cat noises?\nLeonard (returning in a tee shirt and backwards cap): Too casual?\nSheldon: For an audience with the queen, yes. For an evening of passing a bottle of fortified wine around a flaming trash can, you look great. (Leonard leaves again. Sheldon draws a picture of a cats face and returns to making cat noises at the window.) What am I thinking? Whiskers!\nScene: The cinema.\nPenny: Oh, hey, if we hurry, we can make the new Jennifer Aniston movie.\nLeonard: Oh, yeah, sure. There\u2019s also an amazing documentary about building a dam on river in South America.\nPenny: Okay, but the Jennifer Aniston movie has Jennifer Aniston, and she\u2019s not building a dam.\nLeonard: Can\u2019t argue with that. I\u2019ll get the tickets.\nPenny: Okay.\nLeonard: Actually, you know what? I think it\u2019s about time I pick a movie we see.\nPenny: You pick plenty of movies.\nLeonard: No. You always picked, and it was always the same. An hour and a half of beach houses in the rain until the woman turns around and realizes love was here all along.\nPenny: But come on, that is a great movie, and it starts in ten minutes.\nLeonard: I hate those movies.\nPenny: No, you don\u2019t.\nLeonard: Yes, I do. The only reason I went is because you wanted to see them, and I wanted to have sex. To this day, I can\u2019t see a Sandra Bullock movie poster without getting both bored and aroused.\nPenny: Okay, so while we were going out, how often would you pretend to like things just to have sex with me?\nLeonard: All the time.\nPenny: You\u2019re kidding.\nLeonard: Does this sound familiar? I\u2019d love to go shoe shopping with you. Hiking? It\u2019s great. It\u2019s two a.m., of course I want to go to Korea Town and sing karaoke with your friends. Who wouldn\u2019t?\nPenny: Okay, we were going out. You were going to get sex anyway.\nLeonard: Really? You would have slept with me after a three-hour documentary on dams?\nPenny: No. No woman would.\nLeonard: See? Now, that\u2019s the great thing. We\u2019re out as friends. This is not a date. Sex is off the table. So, let\u2019s go learn why hydroelectric power might not be the environmental bargain you think it is. Sorry. Spoiler alert.\nPenny: All right, fine.\nLeonard: Thanks. Tickets are eleven bucks. Not a date.\nScene: The apartment.\nRaj: Come on, Sheldon, Star Wars.\nHoward: I\u2019m pushing play.\nSheldon: A minute.\nHoward: If we don\u2019t start soon, George Lucas is going to change it again.\nSheldon: This would go a lot faster if you put your trade school diploma to work and helped me set up this high frequency tone generator.\nHoward: I have a Masters degree from M.I.T.\nSheldon: Yeah, but you\u2019ve got a can-do attitude and that\u2019s what\u2019s important.\nRaj: I really don\u2019t get your problem with birds.\nSheldon: The question you should be asking is what is their problem with me? My first memory, a hummingbird dive-bombing my stroller to get at the apple juice in my sippy cup.\nRaj: Hummingbirds are pretty.\nSheldon: Hummingbirds are the vampires of the flower world.\nRaj: Still my first choice for an ankle tattoo. Or a dolphin, I go back and forth.\nSheldon: Age seven, a blood-thirsty chicken chases me up a tree. Age twelve, a magpie tries to steal the retainer out of my mouth. Age sixteen, a parrot in a pet store called me fat ass. Need I go on?\nRaj: Yes, please. This is way better than the movie.\nHoward: All right, Sheldon, your bird death ray is ready.\nSheldon: It\u2019s not a death ray. It\u2019s just a little ultrasonic blast to scare him off. Trust me, if I had a death ray, I wouldn\u2019t be living here. I\u2019d be in my lair enjoying the money the people of Earth gave me for not using my death ray. All right, and in three, two, one. (Switches on. All the windows shatter. The bird doesn\u2019t move.)\nRaj: That is one tough birdie.\nScene: A bar.\nLeonard: Come on, you enjoyed the movie. I saw you tearing up when the village got flooded, and everyone had to relocate.\nPenny: No, I was thinking how come they get to leave and I can\u2019t.\nLeonard: I\u2019m going to get some fries. You want anything?\nPenny: Uh, no, thanks.\nLeonard: Are you sure? Because you always say no, and then you eat half my fries.\nPenny: I just eat the little crispy ones you don\u2019t like.\nLeonard: No, I love them. I save them for the end, but they\u2019re gone because you ate them. And why did I let you eat them?\nPenny: To get sex.\nLeonard: Exactly. But this is not a date. So I ask again, would you like anything?\nPenny: All right, I\u2019d like an order of fries.\nLeonard: Great. That\u2019ll be five dollars. I am having the best time. I\u2019m so glad you suggested we do this.\nPenny (accidentally nudging the man sitting behind her): Oh, sorry.\nMan: No problem.\nPenny: What you writing there?\nMan: A screenplay. Its about a guy whose roommate is having sex and tells him go to a bar and work on his screenplay.\nPenny: I Hope Alex Gets Crabs: The Movie.\nMan: It\u2019s a working title.\nPenny: Oh.\nMan: I\u2019m Kevin.\nPenny: Oh. Penny. Nice to meet you.\nKevin: I\u2019ll let you get back to your date.\nPenny: Oh, no, no. This isn\u2019t a date, no. Right?\nLeonard: Uh, right.\nPenny: So have you written anything I might have seen?\nKevin: That depends. How much time do you spend on Yelp?\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: This is ridiculous. I\u2019m a grown man from Texas. This isn\u2019t a terrifying bird like a swan or a goose. It\u2019s just a blue jay. (Opens window) That\u2019s a pretty big blue jay. (Closes window. Goes to cabinet. Comes out wearing a Boba Fett helmet and a broom) One, two, three. (Opens window) Go! Shoo! Am-scray, ird-bay! (Bird flies in window) Bird in the apartment! Bird in the apartment! (Sees the bird sitting in his place) No!\nScene: The bar.\nPenny (to Kevin): So it is an amazing documentary. They need the electricity from the dam, but at the same time they want to preserve the environment.\nLeonard: You\u2019re kidding me. Uh, can I see you for a sec over here?\nPenny: Oh, yeah. Sure. Just one sec?\nKevin: No problem.\nPenny: What\u2019s up?\nLeonard: I know what you\u2019re doing.\nPenny: What am I doing?\nLeonard: You\u2019re going out of your way to talk to that guy because I said we weren\u2019t on a date.\nPenny: No, I\u2019m talking to him because he\u2019s cute.\nLeonard: Come on, he\u2019s not that cute.\nPenny: Yes, he is. With his dorky T-shirt and his little hipster glasses.\nLeonard: I wear dorky T-shirts and glasses.\nPenny: Yes, but when you\u2019re tall and have great cheekbones, you\u2019re doing it ironically.\nLeonard: If that\u2019s so, what if I start talking to a girl?\nPenny: You should.\nLeonard: I\u2019m serious. I\u2019ll do it.\nPenny: Good! Go! There are some girls right over there. What are you waiting for?\nLeonard: They\u2019re in a group. I\u2019m scared.\nScene: The apartment.\nAmy: Sheldon, what do you expect us to do?\nSheldon: You\u2019re biologists. Biology is the study of living things. That\u2019s a living thing, get cracking.\nBernadette: I specialize in microorganisms, and Amy studies brains.\nAmy: Yeah, neither of us minored in bird-shooing.\nSheldon: Oh, come now. Your undergraduate work must have included a varmints and critters class.\nBernadette: Come back in, Sheldon, he\u2019s not going to hurt you. He looks friendly. I think he might be someone\u2019s pet.\nSheldon: No, Bernadette, don\u2019t be a hero!\nBernadette: Oh, he\u2019s a sweetie.\nSheldon: Yes. It\u2019s very sweet. Now, slowly and carefully, flush him down the toilet.\nAmy: Sheldon, the only way to get past this fear is to interact with it. Just like you did with the mailman.\nSheldon: Every year tens of people around the world are killed by birds. I\u2019m not going to be another statistic.\nBernadette: Look how sweet he is. Come over and say hi. Come on. You can do it. Don\u2019t be scared. Come on. Oh, just pet the bird, you big baby!\nSheldon: I did it! I actually did it. Okay, now flush him.\nScene: The bar.\nWoman: So, Leonard, what do you do for fun?\nLeonard: Um, let\u2019s see. Hiking. Karaoke in Koreatown. Any Jennifer Aniston movie.\nPenny: Hey. Sorry I ditched you.\nLeonard: No, it\u2019s fine. You can ditch away.\nPenny: Oh, no, no. We said we were going to hang out, let\u2019s hang out.\nLeonard: It\u2019s cool. Go back to Kevin.\nPenny: Oh, he had to leave.\nLeonard: Interesting. So now that he\u2019s gone, you want to hang out with me.\nWoman: This must be Penny.\nLeonard: Yep.\nWoman: I totally get it.\nPenny: Huh? I\u2019m sorry, get what?\nLeonard: Don\u2019t worry about it. You know, there\u2019s some guys over there. You should go talk to them.\nPenny: No, no. I want to know what you told her.\nLeonard: That\u2019s kind of between me and\u2026\nWoman: Laura.\nLeonard: Laura.\nPenny: Oh. Okay, I see. So while he was telling you things, did he mention he owns not one, but two Star Trek uniforms?\nLaura: Really?\nPenny: Yeah. Wears them. Not just for Halloween.\nLeonard: Hey, pal. You didn\u2019t see me telling Kevin that you thought cold wars were only fought in winter.\nPenny: Okay. Then I\u2019ll return the favour, and I won\u2019t tell\u2026\nLaura: Laura.\nPenny: Laura that half the dirty movies you own are animated.\nLeonard: When you were telling Kevin about your acting career, did you mention your long-running role as Waitress in a local production of The Cheesecake Factory?\nPenny: Did you tell her about your lucky asthma inhaler?\nLeonard: Oh, yeah? Spell asthma.\nPenny: A\u2026 S\u2026 Take me home.\nLeonard: Maybe I\u2019m not done hanging out with\u2026 (Laura has gone) You\u2019re right, it\u2019s getting late.\nScene: The apartment. Sheldon has the bird on his arm.\nSheldon: It\u2019s remarkable. All that time spent in fear. And for what? He\u2019s magnificent. Oh, dear. I just realized I haven\u2019t offered you a beverage.\nBernadette: Oh, it\u2019s just like my grandma with her parrot. And after she lost her marbles with her remote control.\nSheldon: My phone\u2019s on the desk over there. Take a picture of us together. Make it good enough to go on a mug, a mouse pad, and a calendar. If you were a dove, I\u2019d call you Lovey-Dovey. Oh. Who am I kidding? This isn\u2019t a moment for strict adherence to the literal. You\u2019re just my little Lovey-Dovey, aren\u2019t you?\nAmy: Guess you gotta have hollow bones to get some sugar around here.\nBernadette: I still think he looks like someone\u2019s pet. Maybe we should put up posters.\nSheldon: Yes. It should have a big picture of him, and the words, is this your bird? Not anymore. We\u2019re going to have so much fun together. You can carry messages to all my enemies. I can tie a string to your leg and fly you like a kite.\nAmy: If you\u2019re keeping him, I\u2019ve got a cage you can borrow. One of the test monkeys slipped on a banana peel and broke his neck. It was both tragic and hysterical.\nSheldon: Nonsense. No. Lovey-Dovey doesn\u2019t sleep in a cage. No. Lovey-Dovey sleeps in his very own nest, which I\u2019m going to get off the windowsill and put in my room. Isn\u2019t that right, LD? (Opens window. Bird flies out.) No. Where are you going? Come back, Lovey-Dovey! This is your home now! I already ordered 20 pounds of bird feed off of Amazon! He\u2019s gone.\nAmy: I\u2019m sorry, Sheldon.\nSheldon: How could he do this to me? Get back here, you stupid bird, so I can love you!\nScene: The stairwell. They ascend without talking.\nLeonard: Okay. So, we went out, saw a movie, met some nice people, said horrible things about each other in public, all in all, a pretty magical night.\nPenny: Okay, I\u2019m not innocent in all this, but you basically called me stupid, you asthmatic dumbass.\nLeonard: I know, I, I, I crossed a line. And I\u2019m sorry. No, no, no, hang on. I really mean it. And it\u2019s not like when we were going out, I\u2019d just apologize for everything so we could end up in bed. This is a 100% sex-is-off-the-table I\u2019m sorry.\nPenny: All right. Thank you. I\u2019m sorry, too.\nLeonard: Just to be clear, sex is off the table, right?\nPenny: Way off.\nLeonard: Maybe we\u2019re not ready to hang out as friends.\nPenny: I don\u2019t know. Up until the last part, I was kind of enjoying take-charge Leonard with a little backbone. Picking the movie, knowing what he wants, a little cocky.\nLeonard: Really?\nPenny: Yeah.\nLeonard: Well, then, I\u2019m putting sex back on the table. What do you think about that?\nPenny: Ooh. Maybe I like it.\nLeonard: You do? Because if that\u2019s what you like, I can be that guy. I swear, I\u2019ll be anything you want me to be.\nPenny: Good night, Leonard.\nLeonard: I am such an asthmatic dumbass. I had a weird night.\nSheldon: Mine was great. I\u2019m going to be a mommy. (Reveals nest with an egg in it.)\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "9_7": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: Did you hear about this study that found people that were cool and popular at 13 have problems succeeding later in life?\nRaj: Hmm. I\u2019m doing okay, and I was very popular at 13.\nPenny: In school?\nRaj: Oh, no. At home. The servants would sing to me, laugh at my jokes. I wish I knew their names.\nPenny: Does the study say what happens to the unpopular kids?\nLeonard: You tell me, you woke up in bed with one.\nSheldon: Listen to this. I just received an e-mail from Wil Wheaton. Leonard Nimoy\u2019s son is working on a documentary that he started with his father before he passed away. It\u2019s about Mr. Spock and his impact on our culture.\nLeonard: Why is he writing to you?\nSheldon: Well, they\u2019re looking for fans to interview, and Wil thought I\u2019d be good for it.\nRaj: Oh. Hey, high five.\nSheldon: Absolutely not. Yeah, Penny, you spent some time in front of the camera. Any words of advice?\nPenny: Yes. Don\u2019t take your shirt off just because the director said so.\nSheldon: This is a documentary about Mr. Spock. I\u2019m sure if there\u2019s nudity, it will be tasteful.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s house.\nBernadette: Hey. You got a minute?\nHoward: Not really. Visigoths are kind of up my butt right now.\nBernadette: Pause the game, Howard.\nHoward: Howard? Uh-oh. Make room, Visigoths. \u2018Sup?\nBernadette: We need to talk about redecorating this place.\nHoward: Oh, no, not this again.\nBernadette: Look, I get that you grew up here and you\u2019re attached to things looking a certain way, but I want this to feel like my house, too.\nHoward: Oh, honey, of course it\u2019s your house. Why else would you be cleaning it all the time?\nBernadette: All right. Let\u2019s start over. I\u2019m redecorating. The furniture, the carpeting, the walls. I\u2019m changing everything that depresses me when I look at it. Try not to be one of those things.\nHoward: May I say something?\nBernadette: Is it about how I can\u2019t have new wallpaper \u2019cause your dad left when you were little and your mom died?\nHoward: Never mind.\nScene: The apartment. \nSheldon (on phone): Hello, Amy. It\u2019s Sheldon. Yeah, I, I know that we\u2019re broken up, but I\u2019m leaving this message because I thought perhaps you\u2019d like to watch me be interviewed for a documentary about Mr. Spock. Or as I like to call it, a Spockumentary. Yeah, I\u2019m going to use that joke in the interview, so try to laugh like you\u2019re hearing it for the first time. You know, hysterically, hmm? And with a tinge of sadness that I\u2019m no longer in your life.\nLeonard: I\u2019m the one who thought of Spockumentary.\nPenny: And I\u2019m laughing like I did the first time I heard it.\nSheldon (answering door): Hello.\nWil Wheaton: Hey, Sheldon. This is Adam Nimoy.\nAdam: Nice to meet you.\nSheldon: Oh, it\u2019s nice to meet you. I admire your father\u2019s work very much. It\u2019s not every day I get to meet someone whose life\u2019s journey began in my hero\u2019s scrotum.\nWil: I told you. This guy is gold.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s kitchen.\nBernadette: Whatcha doing?\nHoward: Oh. Making myself a bologna sandwich like my mom used to make me after my dad left, but before she died.\nBernadette: Okay, listen, I\u2019m thinking that maybe we can compromise on the house.\nHoward: I\u2019m listening.\nBernadette: Let\u2019s just redo one room and see how it goes.\nHoward: That is reasonable. But what room?\nBernadette: How \u2019bout this one?\nHoward: No way. No, this is the room I associate the most with my mom.\nBernadette: Then how \u2019bout the bathroom?\nHoward: I want to change my answer.\nBernadette: Fine. Then the dining room.\nHoward: I guess we didn\u2019t use it very often. Unless we had company. Which didn\u2019t happen much after my dad left and not at all after my mom\u2026\nBernadette: Great. I\u2019m gonna go pick out paint samples.\nScene: The apartment.\nAdam: All right, we\u2019re just gonna have a conversation. Pretend the camera\u2019s not here.\nSheldon: All right. But this better not be some elaborate scheme to get me out of my shirt.\nLeonard: How long have you known Adam?\nWil: A few years.\nLeonard: And what are you getting him back for?\nAdam: Let\u2019s start with your name and occupation.\nSheldon: Dr. Sheldon Cooper, theoretical physicist, Caltech.\nAdam: And what is your earliest memory of the character Spock?\nSheldon: The first episode of Star Trek: The Original Series I ever saw was The Galileo Seven. Uh, Spock had just landed on the planet Taurus II. Then my brother came in, sat on my head, and said eat farts. After that day, I was hooked. On Star Trek, not my brother\u2019s sphincter-based cuisine.\nAdam: What was it about Spock that appealed to you?\nSheldon: I think the same thing that appeals to people everywhere, the dream of a cold, rational world entirely without human emotion. Spock came from a planet governed only by logic. You know, on Vulcan, when your brother asks, why are you hitting yourself? the answer is, I\u2019m not. You\u2019re moving my arm. To which he says, Fascinating. And then you both watch educational television.\nPenny: Aw. When he says things like that, I just want to hug him and make everything better.\nLeonard: My brother was mean to me, too.\nPenny: Yeah, you probably had it coming.\nAdam: Do you have any Spock collectibles?\nSheldon: I have many. My most treasured is an autographed napkin given to me by my very thoughtful friend Penny. That\u2019s her over there.\nPenny: Hi. Look at that. I\u2019m in a movie, my shirt stayed on.\nAdam: Can we see the napkin?\nSheldon: Of course. Excuse me. This will just take a moment.\nLeonard: When did we get a wall safe?\nSheldon: When there was no more room in the floor safe.\nLeonard: When did we get a floor safe?\nSheldon: When we got the security camera.\nLeonard: There\u2019s a security camera?\nSheldon: Aquaman, protecting your home since 2012.\nPenny: Oh, my God. We\u2019ve done things on that couch.\nSheldon: Yeah. You don\u2019t have to tell me.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s house.\nRaj: So, your father-in-law is in there right now?\nHoward: Yes. So back me up. The house is good the way it is.\nRaj: Oh, okay. Got it.\nHoward: Hey. What\u2019s going on?\nRaj: Hey.\nBernadette: Hey, Raj. Dad and I were just talking about taking down this wall.\nRaj: You sure? It\u2019s a pretty great wall.\nMr Rostenkowski: What\u2019s so great about it?\nRaj: I\u2019m sorry. I did what I could.\nBernadette: Seriously? You brought Raj over to take your side?\nHoward: Your dad\u2019s on your side.\nBernadette: He\u2019s not on my side. He\u2019s doing all the work for free.\nRaj: That is so generous of you. I\u2019d like to switch sides.\nHoward: Look, uh, I don\u2019t even think you can take this wall down \u2019cause it\u2019s load-bearing.\nRaj: Well, it\u2019s easy to find out. Just go into the crawlspace under the house and check.\nHoward: When is your visa up?\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Not only is it signed to me but this is where he wiped his mouth. So we are currently in the presence of Leonard Nimoy\u2019s DNA.\nWil: Um, doesn\u2019t Adam count as Leonard Nimoy\u2019s DNA?\nSheldon: No offence, but this is pure 100% Nimoy. Because of your mother, you\u2019re only 50%. Which isn\u2019t bad, but anything that you wipe your mouth on gets thrown away.\nPenny: Okay, enough about the napkin. What else you hiding in there?\nSheldon: Wouldn\u2019t you like to know?\nPenny: I would.\nSheldon: All right then. See? Just my valuables. My passport, uh, my will.\nLeonard: You have a will?\nSheldon: Yeah. My 1/18 scale Wil Wheaton action figure. I also have the other kind of will, and in it I will my Wil back to Wil.\nLeonard: Will Wil want it?\nWil: Wil won\u2019t.\nPenny: Oh, what\u2019s that ring box?\nSheldon: Oh. That is an engagement ring that I was going to give my girlfriend Amy.\nPenny: What?\nLeonard: You bought her a ring?\nSheldon: No, no. This has been in my family for generations. Except for a short time when Comanches cut off my great-great-great-grandmother\u2019s finger and stole it.\nWil: Sheldon, that\u2019s awful.\nSheldon: No. The Texas Rangers tracked them down to their village and slaughtered every last one of them. It was a happy ending. Well, for my nine-fingered Nana.\nPenny: Okay, back to the ring. Does Amy even know about this?\nSheldon: No. She broke up with me before I could broach the subject.\nLeonard: Oh, man, I\u2019m sorry, that must have been devastating for you.\nSheldon: No, not at all. No, I\u2019m fine. You know, Amy had reservations about our relationship, so all worked out for the best.\nPenny: I know. It just\u2026\nSheldon (shouting): I said I\u2019m fine! (Long pause) We\u2019ve gotten a little off-topic. Allow me to make things entertaining again in this little Spockumentary. That was Leonard\u2019s joke. As a child, when faced with a dilemma, my mother encouraged me to ask what would Jesus do? The answer to that was always love thy neighbour. But my neighbour had a dead tooth, so that wasn\u2019t going to happen. But that\u2019s why I changed it to, what would Spock do?\nAdam: Did you find that helpful?\nSheldon: Yes. Oh, for example, three years ago when I discovered Penny was eating all my Pop-Tarts, instead of getting angry or vindictive, you know, I got a floor safe.\nPenny: I knew I could smell \u2019em.\nAdam: What about from when you were a kid?\nSheldon: Oh, certainly. Uh, when I was eight years old, Billy Sparks cornered me in the playground. I asked myself what would Spock do? Then I grabbed Billy on his shoulder and performed my first Vulcan nerve pinch.\nAdam: Did it work?\nSheldon: Oh, no, he broke my collarbone. I can still hear it click.\nAdam: That must have been very upsetting for you.\nSheldon: Oh, not at all. As I said, the entire point of emulating Spock was to rise above human emotion, which I\u2019ve spent a lifetime mastering.\nPenny: Oh pfft.\nSheldon: Excuse me?\nPenny: I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m not here.\nSheldon: No. You went pfft. What does pfft mean?\nPenny: Um.\nLeonard: You did go pfft.\nPenny: All right, fine. Well, Sheldon, I\u2019m no expert, but aren\u2019t you completely missing the point of Spock? I mean, he liked to act like he had no emotions, but he was still half human.\nLeonard: Just like you.\nPenny: I\u2019m just saying, you pretend you don\u2019t, but you have feelings just like everybody else.\nSheldon: Not true. No, look at me. I had an engagement ring to give a girl, and instead, she rejected me. And am I emotional about that? No. No, I am sitting here on a couch, talking about my favourite TV character like nothing happened. \u2018Cause I am just like him, all logical, all the time.\nPenny: Sweetie, you\u2019re yelling.\nSheldon: Because when I speak at a regular volume, no one seems to believe me that I\u2019ve put this Amy nonsense behind me.\nWil: This documentary is gonna be awesome.\nScene: The crawlspace under Howard and Bernadette\u2019s house.\nMr Rostenkowski: You gonna be okay down here?\nHoward: Yeah. Yeah, I feel like an archaeologist. Indiana Jones and the Single-Family Dwelling. Hey. Look. Found a seashell.\nMr Rostenkowski: Yeah, that\u2019s a rat skull.\nHoward: Oh.\nMr Rostenkowski: Relax. There\u2019s enough droppings down here without you making more.\nHoward: Sorry. Do you have a sense of where we are?\nMr Rostenkowski: Yeah. I think that\u2019s the den.\nHoward: Oh. Okay, so we must be under the dining room.\nMr Rostenkowski: Uh-huh. Yep. You know, I know you don\u2019t want to hear this, but it wouldn\u2019t take that much work to turn that den into a nursery.\nHoward: Why wouldn\u2019t I want to hear it?\nMr Rostenkowski: \u2018Cause Bernie said you didn\u2019t want kids.\nHoward: That\u2019s not true at all. I wish she\u2019d get pregnant, believe me. I\u2019m climbing on top of her every chance I get. In a loving and respectful manner. The point is, I really do want kids.\nMr Rostenkowski: Huh.\nHoward: I don\u2019t know why she\u2019s lying to you. She\u2019s the one who doesn\u2019t want kids. In fact, every time I bring up the subject\u2026\nBernadette (above): Earthquake.\nHoward: Oh, my God, we\u2019re gonna die.\nBernadette: Aftershock.\nScene: The apartment.\nPenny: I can\u2019t believe Sheldon was gonna ask Amy to marry him.\nLeonard: I know. I also can\u2019t believe he watched what we did on that couch and still sits on it.\nPenny: Yeah.\nSheldon: Hello.\nLeonard: Hey, buddy. How you doing?\nSheldon: Better. Did Wil and Adam leave?\nLeonard: Yeah.\nSheldon: Do you think they\u2019re going to put my outburst in the documentary?\nLeonard: Oh, yeah.\nPenny: Definitely.\nSheldon: Well, there\u2019s no point in dwelling on it. As the Vulcans say, Kup-fun-tor ha\u2019kiv na\u2019ish Du stau.\nPenny: Do you know what that means?\nLeonard: No.\nPenny: Are you telling the truth?\nLeonard: Nirsh.\nSheldon: Well, this is ridiculous. Being upset about Amy all the time isn\u2019t accomplishing anything. If I want to resolve this situation, then I need to take action.\nPenny: What are you gonna do?\nSheldon: I\u2019m going to find her and ask her to marry me. And if she says yes, we can put this behind us and resume our relationship. And if she says no, well, then she can just ponfo miran.\nLeonard: He didn\u2019t meant that.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s kitchen.\nBernadette: So I should probably explain why I kind of fibbed.\nHoward: That would be nice.\nBernadette: I told my dad that you were the one who didn\u2019t want kids because I didn\u2019t want to disappoint him.\nHoward: But you were okay throwing me under the bus?\nBernadette: Turns out yeah, I didn\u2019t think twice about it.\nMr Rostenkowski: Bernie, you don\u2019t need to worry about me. But I don\u2019t want to see you miss out. Raising children was the most rewarding experience of my life.\nBernadette: Oh, please. Mom did everything. All you did was come home from work, sit on the couch and drink beer. How is that raising kids?\nMr Rostenkowski: This is really a conversation for husband and wife. I\u2019m gonna go clean up, hit the road. If your mother asks, I was here till ten.\nRaj: It\u2019s interesting your father didn\u2019t help around the house and Howard doesn\u2019t help, either, so in a way, Howard\u2019s not only like your father, but he\u2019s also like the child that you\u2019re afraid to have.\nHoward: Why are you still here?\nRaj: Fine, I\u2019ll leave. But it sounds like somebody needs a fresh diaper.\nHoward: All right, I admit that I don\u2019t help out a lot. And I need to work on that. But if we had a kid, it would be different.\nBernadette: Why?\nHoward: Because when my dad left, I promised myself that if I ever had a chance to be a father I\u2019d always be there.\nBernadette: Okay, I\u2019ll think about it.\nHoward: And this an actual I\u2019ll think about it, not like the can we get a motorcycle with a sidecar I\u2019ll think about it\u201d?\nBernadette: It\u2019s an actual I\u2019ll think about it.\nHoward: I really believe I\u2019d be a great dad.\nBernadette: I know you would.\nHoward: Speaking of making babies, what do you say I wash up and poke around your crawlspace?\nScene: The street. Sheldon sees Amy with another man. He leaves. \nScene: The apartment.\nKirk (on screen): Dr. Dana feels he isn\u2019t that dangerous. What makes you right and a trained psychiatrist wrong?\nSpock (on screen): Because she feels. I don\u2019t. All I know is logic.\nSheldon: Yeah, right. You can just shut your feelings off. There goes television, lying to us again. We let you raise our children, and this is the thanks we get. Leonard, how could I have been so foolish to try and follow in the footsteps of a made-up alien race with no emotions?\nLeonard: Well now instead of idolizing fictional characters, you can focus on the real people who are already in your life.\nSheldon: Those are very wise words.\nLeonard: Thank you.\nSheldon: They\u2019d just be so much more comforting if they came out of a television.\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "4_16": "\n\t\t\t\tEpisode begins with a \u201cPreviously on\u201d sequence before first scene.\nScene: Bernadette\u2019s bedroom.\nHoward: What\u2019s so funny?\nBernadette: Nothing. Just thinking about the noises people make during sex.\nHoward: I do sometimes get a bit carried away, don\u2019t I?\nBernadette: It\u2019s cute. You sound a little like a drunken monkey. Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh!\nHoward: You know it\u2019s meant as a compliment.\nBernadette: That\u2019s how I take it.\nHoward: This is perfect. I hope this moment never ends.\nBernadette: Me too.\nHoward: Well, gotta go.\nBernadette: Oh! Already? Why don\u2019t you stay over?\nHoward: Well, I\u2019d love to, but you know my mother needs me in the morning.\nBernadette: Please, I think the woman can manage to put a wig on by herself.\nHoward: It\u2019s not just the wig. It\u2019s pinning her hair up, drawing on her eyebrows. It\u2019s a two-person job.\nBernadette: It\u2019s just, when you leave right after we make love, it makes me feel cheap.\nHoward: Oh, honey, I\u2019m sorry. What can I do?\nBernadette: Stay.\nHoward: Okay. Like, what, another five, ten minutes?\nBernadette: Go home.\nHoward: Your call.\nBernadette: Howard, have you ever considered us living together?\nHoward: Boy, I don\u2019t know. You, me, Ma living under the same roof?\nBernadette: No, I mean just you and me. You can move in here, or we can find a place.\nHoward: I\u2019ve got a better solution.\nBernadette: What?\nHoward: We wait for my mom\u2019s heart to explode from all the salt she eats. Then we just stick her in the ground, flip her mattress and move into the big bedroom.\nBernadette: Great.\nHoward: Look at us planning a future together.\nScene: Outside Howard\u2019s house.\nMrs Wolowitz (voice): Who\u2019s there? Are you a sex criminal?\nHoward: Sex criminals don\u2019t have keys, Ma.\nMrs Wolowitz: Where were you so late?\nHoward: I was out with Bernadette.\nMrs Wolowitz: I know what that means, I watch Dr. Phil. I hope to God you used a condom!\nHoward: I\u2019m not having this conversation with you, Ma!\nMrs Wolowitz: God forbid you get one of those new fancy sex diseases!\nHoward: Nobody has a disease!\nMrs Wolowitz: I hope not. I share a toilet with you. Is that what you want? To give your mother herpes?\nHoward: That\u2019s it. I don\u2019t have to take this. Good luck with your eyebrows in the morning!\nMrs Wolowitz: Who\u2019s there? Are you a sex criminal?\nHoward: I\u2019m still leaving! I just forgot my Claritin.\nCredits sequence.\n \nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: Hey, what\u2019s up?\nHoward: I need a place to crash.\nLeonard: Uh, sure. Why?\nHoward: Big fight with my mother.\nLeonard: Still arguing over which CSI is the best?\nHoward: No, we agreed they all have their merits. This was about Bernadette.\nSheldon: What\u2019s going on?\nLeonard: Howard\u2019s gonna sleep here tonight. He had a fight with his mother.\nSheldon: Did you offer him a hot beverage?\nLeonard: No.\nSheldon: Leonard, social protocol states when a friend is upset, you offer them a hot beverage, such as tea.\nHoward: Tea does sound nice.\nSheldon: You heard the man, Leonard. And while you\u2019re at it, I\u2019m upset that we have an unannounced houseguest, so make me cocoa. Point of inquiry, given that Leonard is your secondary friend and Koothrappali is your primary friend, why didn\u2019t you seek refuge under his roof?\nHoward: There\u2019s no room. His sister is staying with him.\nLeonard: Wait, wait. What?\nSheldon: Cocoa, Leonard. Focus. I\u2019m down in the dumps here.\nLeonard: Priya\u2019s in town?\nHoward: Yeah, some work thing. Anyway, my mother seems to think that Bernadette\u2026\nLeonard: Hold on. When did Priya get here?\nHoward: I don\u2019t know. A couple of days ago. The thing is, Bernadette doesn\u2019t like that I have to take care of my mother, and my mother doesn\u2019t trust Bernadette.\nLeonard: Yeah, that\u2019s a real pickle. Bye.\nSheldon: Don\u2019t worry. As your tertiary friend, I am prepared to step in and comfort you.\nHoward: That\u2019s not really necessary.\nSheldon: No, no. I\u2019ll finish making the tea, while you narcissistically ramble on about whatever\u2019s troubling you.\nHoward: Thanks.\nSheldon: That\u2019s what tertiary friends are for.\nScene: Raj\u2019s Apartment. Leonard knocks on the door. \nRaj (inside): Who is it?\nLeonard: It\u2019s Leonard.\nRaj: You can\u2019t come in.\nLeonard: I just want to talk to her.\nRaj: I forbid it.\nPriya: Open the door, Rajesh.\nRaj: You heard me. I forbidded it.\nPriya: Forbidded it?\nRaj: Forbaded it?\nPriya: Get out of the way. What are you doing here?\nLeonard: What are you doing here?\nPriya: I have business in Los Angeles.\nLeonard: Why didn\u2019t you call?\nRaj: Clearly, she was sending you a message to take a hike, Mike.\nPriya: I\u2019m sorry. I thought about calling, but I just wasn\u2019t sure if seeing you was such a good idea.\nLeonard: I know. Last time I came on too strong. Can we talk in private?\nRaj: No!\nPriya: Sure.\nRaj: It\u2019s completely inappropriate for a single woman to entertain a man in private. If you insist on talking, you must do it on the couch! All right, you may talk in the bedroom, but I want this door to remain open! All right, just this once you may close the door. But keep in mind I\u2019ll be right out here monitoring the situation! (Dials phone) Oh, damn it. Leonard, when you get this message, call me. (Dials again) Priya, this is your brother. When you get this, tell Leonard to check his voicemail.\nScene: The Cheesecake Factory.\nSheldon: Would you be sleeping over again this evening? Because you\u2019re welcome to.\nHoward: That\u2019s very nice of you, but I made other plans.\nSheldon: Well, just keep in mind that should you ever need a slightly apathetic tertiary friend, I stand at the ready.\nPriya: Hi, Howard. Hi, Sheldon.\nHoward: Hey.\nSheldon: Hello.\nRaj: Why are you holding hands? I forbid you to hold hands.\nPriya: Rajesh, you know Leonard and I spent the night together.\nRaj: Yeah, but you were just sleeping, because I forboded you to have sex.\nLeonard: The word is forbade.\nRaj: Are you sure? That doesn\u2019t sound right.\nPriya: Listen, Rajesh, Leonard and I have decided to see each other again, and you don\u2019t get to tell me who I can and can\u2019t have a relationship with.\nSheldon: Actually, he can. The Hindu Code of Manu is very clear in these matters. If a woman\u2019s father is not around, the duty of controlling her base desires falls to the closest male member of her family, in this case, Raj. The code also states that if she disobeys, she will be reborn in the womb of a jackal and tormented by diseases. If true, that seems like an awfully large gamble given that the prize is Leonard.\nRaj: There it is, Priya. We\u2019re Indian. We believe this stuff.\nPriya: I think it also says that if you eat beef, you need to live with cows for three months and drink their urine.\nRaj: Some of it makes sense, some of it\u2019s crazy. My point is, you can\u2019t go out with Leonard.\nPenny (arriving): Who can\u2019t go out with Leonard?\nRaj: My sister.\nLeonard: Penny, this is Raj\u2019s sister, Priya.\nPriya: It\u2019s very nice to meet you.\nPenny: Oh, yeah, you, too.\nSheldon: Priya, if you\u2019re experiencing any tension or awkwardness, it may stem from the fact that Leonard and Penny used to, if I may quote Howard, do the dance with no pants.\nPenny: Sheldon!\nLeonard: Really?\nHoward: Hey, Bernadette, can I talk to you for a second?\nBernadette: Sure.\nRaj: Penny, you became disenchanted with Leonard as a lover. Would you please tell my sister why?\nHoward: Listen, my mom\u2019s going to Palm Springs to visit her sister. That\u2019s two whole nights in a row I can sleep over with you all the way to morning. Unless the desert air dries out her sinuses, in which case I\u2019ll have to schlep out there with the big humidifier.\nBernadette: That\u2019s it? That\u2019s your big solution to all of our problems? If your mom\u2019s nose holds up, we get two nights together?\nHoward: Isn\u2019t that great?\nBernadette: No, it\u2019s not great. You need to make a choice. Me or your mother.\nHoward: Oh, uh\u2026\nBernadette: Wrong answer.\nHoward: No, wait. You didn\u2019t let me finish.\nBernadette: I\u2019m listening.\nHoward: Uh\u2026\nBernadette: Agh!\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment. (groans)\nAmy: I came as quickly as I could.\nPenny: Okay. Why?\nAmy: To comfort you, of course. Sheldon told me about Leonard dating Rajesh\u2019s sister. So I high-tailed it over here to pick up the pieces of your broken heart.\nPenny: Amy, I\u2019m fine.\nAmy: You don\u2019t have to be strong for me. Now let\u2019s talk about Priya, that man-stealing bitch.\nPenny: What?\nAmy: In situations like this, best girlfriends are often catty about the other woman. Rawr.\nPenny: Really, I am not upset about Leonard and Priya.\nAmy: Oh. Then perhaps you don\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on. Your former boyfriend has replaced you with what appears to be a very suitable mate. Arguably much more suitable than you.\nPenny: Oh. Well, good for him. Hey, what do you mean, more suitable?\nAmy: Well, granted, Penny, your secondary sexual characteristics are reasonably bodacious. But Priya is highly educated, she\u2019s an accomplished professional, and she comes from the culture that literally wrote the book on neat ways to have sex. Whereas you, on the other hand, are a community college dropout who comes from the culture that wrote the book on tipping cows.\nPenny: Yeah. Okay, I got it. I got it. So, what is all that stuff?\nAmy: This is a portable electroencephalogram. I\u2019m doing research on emotions and brain activity. So when you start crying, I can see which region of the brain is activated. Then I\u2019m going to stimulate the analogous area in the brain of a rhesus monkey and see if he cries. Cool, huh?\nScene: Bernadette\u2019s apartment. Howard knocks on door.\nHoward: I choose you.\nBernadette: Really?\nHoward: Yep. I moved out of my mother\u2019s house. Cord is cut. I\u2019m all yours.\nBernadette: What did she say when you told her?\nHoward: I don\u2019t know. She hasn\u2019t responded to my email yet.\nBernadette: This is so great. I love you, Howard.\nHoward: I love you, too. So what\u2019s for dinner?\nBernadette: Well, I don\u2019t really have much of anything in the house.\nHoward: That\u2019s fine. Why don\u2019t we go fool around in our bedroom? And then you can go shopping.\nScene: The apartment. \nLeonard: I thought maybe after we eat, we could see an early movie.\nPriya: I\u2019d love that.\nLeonard: I love the way you say, I\u2019d love that.\nRaj: She says it the same way I do. I\u2019d love that. Everybody in India says it that way. It\u2019s not a big deal.\nPriya: Rajesh, don\u2019t be a child.\nRaj: I\u2019m not being a child. Leonard, I swear to God, if your sister ever comes to town, I shall have my way with her.\nLeonard: My sister\u2019s 38 and married.\nRaj: All the more shame that will fall upon the house of Hofstadter.\nPenny: Ooh, I thought I smelled pizza.\nSheldon: That\u2019s remarkable. If pepperoni were an explosive substance, you could replace German shepherds at our nation\u2019s airports.\nPriya: Hi. Penny, right?\nPenny: Oh, yes. Hi, hi. I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t know you had company. I don\u2019t want to impose.\nSheldon: No, no. It\u2019s not an imposition. At this point, in our ecosystem, you are akin to the plover, a small scavenging bird that eats extra food from between the teeth of crocodiles. Please, fly into our open maw, and have at it.\nPenny: If I had more than a box of baking soda in my refrigerator, I wouldn\u2019t have to take that.\nAmy: Hi, bestie.\nPenny: Hi. So, um, Priya, you\u2019re a lawyer, right?\nPriya: I know. Pretty boring, huh?\nLeonard: Oh, come on. It\u2019s not boring at all. She\u2019s currently helping set up a secondary derivative market which would allow overseas car firms to hedge their investments against potential advancements in battery technology. Hmm?\nPriya: Thank you, Leonard. That doesn\u2019t make it sound boring at all.\nAmy: So, how you holding up?\nPenny: I\u2019m fine.\nAmy: Oh, who are you kidding? She\u2019s breathtaking.\nPriya: So, Penny, Leonard tells me you\u2019re an actress. That must be pretty exciting.\nPenny: Oh, yeah, yeah. It\u2019s real great. Today I drove to Van Nuys for an audition I thought was going to be for a cat food commercial. Turned out to be porn.\nSheldon: Did you get the part?\nPenny: I didn\u2019t do the audition.\nSheldon: Given the state of your career, can you really afford to be picky?\nPriya: I took acting classes when I was at Cambridge. I loved it. We did Taming of the Shrew.\nLeonard: Oh, wow. I love Taming of the Shrew. I did a paper on it in high school. Who knows not where a wasp does wear his sting? In his tail.\nPriya: In his tongue.\nLeonard: Whose tongue?\nPriya: Yours, if you talk of tails, and so farewell.\nLeonard: What, with my tongue in your tail?\nAmy: I\u2019m regretting my earlier cattiness. She is an absolute delight.\nScene: Bernadette\u2019s bedroom. \nBernadette: Wow.\nHoward: Wow, indeed.\nBernadette: I can\u2019t believe we\u2019re finally living together.\nHoward: Yeah. You know what would make this moment perfect?\nBernadette: What?\nHoward: A little snack. You got any string cheese?\nBernadette: No. I, I might have some cheddar.\nHoward: Not as good. You can\u2019t make strings with it. Remind me to put it on your shopping list.\nBernadette: Okay.\nHoward: You have hypo-allergenic detergent?\nBernadette: No.\nHoward: Better put it on the list. If you wash my underwear with regular soap, I get little red bumps on my tuchus.\nBernadette: Wait a second. I\u2019m doing your laundry?\nHoward: Well, honey, it\u2019s not gonna do itself. Oh, before I forget, tomorrow morning, you\u2019re driving me to the dentist.\nBernadette: I have to take you?\nHoward: You don\u2019t have to take me. You get to take me.\nBernadette: Wait a minute. Are you telling me your mother usually takes you to the dentist?\nHoward: It\u2019s not weird. There\u2019s lots of kids there with their moms.\nBernadette: I can\u2019t believe this.\nHoward: What? It\u2019s fun. If I have no cavities, afterwards, we go out for a treat.\nBernadette: All right, Howard, let\u2019s get something straight right now. I\u2019m not going to be your mother.\nHoward: Whoa, whoa, whoa! Where did that come from?\nScene: Howard\u2019s house. \n \nMrs Wolowitz (off): Who\u2019s that? Is it a sex criminal?\nHoward: Nobody wants to do that to you, Ma.\nMrs Wolowitz: Where were you?\nHoward: Didn\u2019t you read my email?\nMrs Wolowitz: You know I can\u2019t turn on that ferkakta computer. I left you some brisket on the kitchen counter.\nHoward: Thank you.\nMrs Wolowitz: Remember to floss after. We have the dentist in the morning!\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment. \n \nPenny: Oh, hey. What\u2019s up?\nAmy: I just wanted to check in on you.\nPenny: Why?\nAmy: It seems like the appropriate thing to do when one\u2019s best friend finds herself replaced by a smart, beautiful woman with the smouldering sexuality of a crouched Bengal tiger.\nPenny: I already told you, I\u2019m okay with it. I mean, if anything, I\u2019m quite pleased (starting to blub) that Leonard has found someone (starting to blub) that makes him so happy.\nAmy: It\u2019s okay, it\u2019s okay.\nPenny: Thank you.\nAmy: Now, let\u2019s get these electrodes attached and see what\u2019s going on in that pretty little noggin of yours.\nPenny: Okay.\nScene: The apartment. \nPenny: I smell Chinese food.\nSheldon: It\u2019s actually Thai. You\u2019re slipping.\nPenny: Are Leonard and Priya here?\nSheldon: They went to Catalina for the weekend.\nPenny: Oh. Where\u2019s Raj?\nSheldon: At home, forbidding it.\nPenny: How about Howard?\nSheldon: I\u2019m given to understand his mother grounded him for running away.\nPenny: Oh, okay. Well, I guess it\u2019s just the two of us, huh?\nSheldon: Actually, it\u2019s the three of us.\nAmy (on webcam): What up, bestie? Good news. Thanks to you, I was able to make a rhesus monkey cry like a disgraced televangelist.\nPenny: Great.\nAmy: So, you feeling better?\nPenny: Not really.\nAmy: Sheldon, you have a guest who\u2019s upset.\nSheldon: Right. I\u2019ll make tea.\nPenny: Oh, sweetie, it\u2019s okay. I don\u2019t want tea.\nSheldon: I\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s not optional.\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "7_3": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The Cheesecake Factory\nRaj: So, couldn\u2019t help but notice none of you RSVP\u2019d to my murder mystery dinner party.\nLeonard: Oh, yeah. We were meaning to do that.\nRaj: No, you weren\u2019t because it was a week ago and nobody came. So, if you want to solve the mystery of who stabbed Koothrappali in the back with the weapon of indifference, it was all of you.\nSheldon: I don\u2019t think thatqualifies as a mystery, we all knew what we were doing.\nAmy: We\u2019re sorry, Rajesh. \nBernadette: Maybe we can do it next week.\nHoward: Whoa, whoa, we\u2019re not that sorry.\nRaj: Don\u2019t worry, I can take a hint. No more murder mystery parties.\nLeonard: Great. \nSheldon: Thank you.\nHoward: Hallelujah.\nRaj: Because I\u2019ve got something even better planned.\nLeonard: Aw.\nHoward: Why?\nSheldon: Come on.\nRaj: Just hear me out. I\u2019m going to make you guys a scavenger hunt like they have at M.I.T.\nHoward: Oh, I loved those. I did them every year there.\nLeonard: We did them at Princeton, too.\nHoward: Oh, that\u2019s cute. Like it\u2019s a real college.\nSheldon: That\u2019s amusing, I was going to say that about M.I.T., but it works for Princeton, too.\nAmy: Scavenger hunts at Harvard were really tough. I always got stuck on the first challenge, trying to find someone to be on a team with me. I guess that story\u2019s more sad than funny.\nPenny: I love scavenger hunts. My friends and I had them all the time.\nLeonard: Oh, these are a little different. There\u2019s a tradition at elite universities\u2026\nHoward: And Princeton.\nLeonard: A tradition of hunts full of puzzles that rely on logic and obscure knowledge, science.\nPenny: Oh, in ours we would just run around town looking for a store that would sell us beer.\nRaj: So, uh, who\u2019s in?\nLeonard: I think it sounds fun.\nAmy: Yeah, me, too.\nVarious: I\u2019m in, let\u2019s do it.\nSheldon: I\u2019m sorry. Are we really doing this or are we tricking Koothrappali again like with the dinner party?\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: What\u2019s all this?\nSheldon: Oh, everything I could possibly need to win the scavenger hunt.\nLeonard: You really think he\u2019s gonna send us to a bowling alley?\nSheldon: Well, if he does, do you know how filthy those rental balls are? They might as well stand on the corner and give away free rectal exams.\nRaj: Okay, everybody. Who\u2019s ready for a scavenger hunt? (Pumping disco music) Somewhere in the city of Pasadena, I\u2019ve hidden a golden coin. You will be faced with a total of ten puzzles. Each p\u2026 (cough) each, each puzzle will lead you to the location of the next, the last of which will lead you to the coin. The first team that finds it wins.\nSheldon: He is a born showman.\nRaj: Any questions?\nHoward: Yes, to be fair, do people who went to Princeton get a head start?\nLeonard: It\u2019s not funny.\nSheldon: No, Oh, it actually is if you get the joke. It\u2019s based on the premise that Princeton isn\u2019t a very good school. \nLeonard: Ha-ha.\nSheldon: Oh, see? Now he gets it.\nRaj: Okay, guys, go ahead and divide yourselves into teams of two.\nBernadette: Should we just do couples?\nLeonard: Couples sounds great. Or we could mix things up. Maybe pick names out of a hat. Whatever.\nPenny: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Why don\u2019t you just admit you don\u2019t want to be on a team with me.\nLeonard: I just said, couples sound great.\nPenny: Mm-hmm, yeah, you don\u2019t think I\u2019m smart enough. You think I\u2019m gonna be a liability. Even though I totally just used the word liability correctly in a sentence. Yeah.\nLeonard: All right, let\u2019s, let\u2019s do couples. I want to.\nPenny: No, no. Let\u2019s mix things up. I choose Sheldon, and we\u2019re gonna kick your ass!\nSheldon: Really? The only time I\u2019m ever picked first for a team and I\u2019m stuck with the liability?\nAmy: Stop that. Penny is not a liability.\nPenny: Thank you. Do you want to be on my team?\nAmy: Maybe we pick names out of a hat.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment. (Montage with scenes in the apartment and Leonard\u2019s bedroom) \nPenny: All right, hurry up and close the door so they can\u2019t hear us. Would you stop pouting? So, you picked my name. Get over it.\nSheldon: Yes, and do you know what the odds are I\u2019d pick your name?\nPenny: No.\nSheldon: It\u2019s not hard, one in five. Now you know why I\u2019m pouting.\nRaj (over walkie-talkie): All right, teams. Get ready to open your first puzzle. Go. Do you see what I did? The first puzzle is a puzzle. Oh, my God, how adorable is that? I wish I had a friend like me.\nSheldon: What are you doing? You have to start with the edges.\nPenny: Well, there\u2019s no right way, Sheldon. I already found a few pieces that fit.\nSheldon: Yeah, well, take them apart and start with the edges. And stop wasting time.\nHoward: Wow, you\u2019re really good at puzzles.\nAmy: I did them all the time as a kid. As my mom used to say, when you\u2019re doing a puzzle, it\u2019s like having a thousand friends. She was full of fun lies like that.\nHoward: If it makes you feel any better, my mom\u2019s just full of pound cake.\nAmy: I\u2019m sorry you got stuck with me. I bet you wanted to be with Bernadette.\nHoward: Have you ever played a game with Bernadette?\nAmy: No.\nHoward: Have you ever gone into a steel cage with a wolverine?\nBernadette: Faster, faster, faster! Do you not know that word? It means more fast!\nLeonard: Stop yelling at me.\nBernadette: Hey, you\u2019ll know when I\u2019m yelling at you.\nPenny: Ooh, ooh, it\u2019s the comic book store. All right, come on, that\u2019s where we have to go.\nSheldon: But we haven\u2019t finished the puzzle.\nPenny: But, it, it doesn\u2019t matter. We know the answer, come on.\nSheldon: You think you know the answer. But it could be a trick. What if when the puzzle\u2019s complete, there\u2019s a sign in the window that says go to the train store?\nPenny: Okay, it\u2019s not gonna say that.\nSheldon: Well, I hope you\u2019re wrong. I really want to go to the train store.\nHoward: It\u2019s the comic book store. Let\u2019s go.\nBernadette: Come on, numb nuts, it\u2019s the comic book store.\nPenny: It\u2019s the comic book store, it\u2019s the comic book store, it\u2019s the comic book store.\nSheldon: It\u2019s the comic book store.\nScene: Leonard\u2019s car.\nLeonard: Do you think Penny\u2019s mad at me?\nBernadette: Because you\u2019re in the right lane behind a bus and you won\u2019t go around it? I\u2019m sure she finds it charming.\nLeonard: No, because I didn\u2019t want her on my team.\nBernadette: I\u2019m starting to think she dodged a bullet. The slowest bullet in the world.\nLeonard: Geez, I never realized you were so competitive.\nBernadette: Yeah, I know. Its, it\u2019s probably because I grew up with five brothers and sisters so I had to fight for every\u2026 Oh, my God, you did not just slow down for a bird, you know they fly, right?\nScene: Howard\u2019s car.\nAmy: I think this is the first time we\u2019ve ever actually been alone together.\nHoward: Huh, I guess you\u2019re right. Wonder why that is?\nAmy: Well, off the top of my head, I\u2019d say we don\u2019t have a lot in common except for the people we\u2019re involved with. Plus, when we first met, Penny warned me never to get into a car alone with you.\nHoward: Yeah. You know, I bet you and I have more in common than we think.\nAmy: Such as?\nHoward: I don\u2019t know. Tell me some things you like.\nAmy: Uh, let\u2019s see. I like harps, Little House on the Prairie, medieval poetry, medieval literature\u2026\nHoward: Hey, how about some music?\nAmy: Great. Sheldon never lets me listen to music in the car. He doesn\u2019t want to be mistaken for a gang member. \nHoward: Find something you like.\nAmy: Beatles, boring. Eminem, scary. Weird Al? How old are you? Neil Diamond?\nHoward: Yeah, I love Neil Diamond.\nAmy: I love Neil Diamond.\nBoth: Sweet Caroline, bum-ba-da, good times never seemed so good, so good, so good, so good. I\u2019ve been inclined\u2026\nScene: The comic book store.\nRaj: Oh, hey, thanks for letting me use the comic book store as part of the scavenger hunt.\nStuart: Oh, my pleasure. Always happy to help out with fun things that I wasn\u2019t invited to be a part of.\nRaj: Oh, congratulations. You\u2019re the first team to arrive.\nAmy: Yes, it\u2019s not a ruse to make fun of me. It\u2019s a real game and I\u2019m winning it.\nRaj: Your next puzzle is a riddle. And who better to give it to you than The Riddler?\nBernadette: Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go! How am I faster than you? I\u2019m in heels and I stopped to take a phone call.\nLeonard: I have asthma. Back off.\nHoward: Riddle me this. Arrah, Arrah, and gather round, the work of this hero is legion-bound. He multiplies N by the number of He, and in this room the thing you\u2019ll see.\nRaj: Good riddle, huh?\nStuart: Yeah. So when you guys plan fun activities, does my name even come up, or\u2026?\nRaj: I invited you to my murder mystery party.\nStuart: No, you didn\u2019t. \nRaj: Oh.\nPenny: Ugh, we\u2019re the last ones here, hurry up.\nSheldon: It is a marathon, not a sprint.\nPenny: People run in a marathon.\nSheldon: Not with a bowling ball on their back.\nLeonard: Hey, Penny, I just wanted to say good luck, and I hope there\u2019s no hard feelings.\nBernadette: Hey, Romeo. Repair your relationship on your own time.\nLeonard: Relax, it\u2019s a hard puzzle. It\u2019s gonna take a while to solve.\nPenny: Riddle me this\u2026\nSheldon: Got it.\nPenny: Hey, Princeton, look at that, Team Community College Night School is in the lead.\nSheldon: I thought we were the Lightning Sharks.\nHoward: Hey, you know what this could mean (whispers).\nAmy: Oh, oh, that\u2019s good. Then this would be (whispers back)\nHoward: That\u2019s it. \nAmy: To the Neil Mobile.\nBernadette: I knew it, we\u2019re gonna lose.\nLeonard: Wait, I got it. I got it/\nBernadette: Congratulations, you got it last. \nLeonard: You\u2019re really mean, you know that?\nStuart: So no one\u2019s gonna buy anything.\nScene: The geology lab at the University. \nPenny: Aha. Okay, let\u2019s see. To continue on your quest, leave no stone unturned. Ooh.\nSheldon: The next clue must be hidden under one of these rocks.\nPenny: Oh. Okay. Sheldon, I, I\u2019ve got to ask, how did you figure out that it was the geology lab?\nSheldon: Oh, simple, the \u2018arrah, \u2018arrah in the riddle mean Jan Arrah, a member of the Legion of Superheroes, known as Element Lad. And then the word He, it wasn\u2019t the masculine pronoun, but rather H e, the abbreviation for helium. See where I\u2019m going with this?\nPenny: Yes.\nSheldon: Nice try. Now, Element Lad\u2019s ability is the power to transmute chemical elements. Helium has an atomic number of two. If you multiply that by the atomic number of N, nitrogen, you get 14, which is the atomic number of? I\u2019m just funnin\u2019 you, silicon. And that is the most common element in the Earth\u2019s surface. So that narrowed it down to the geology lab or the chemistry lab.\nPenny: Wow. I can drink a beer underwater.\nSheldon: And I\u2019m sure your parents are proud. Now, finally, the line in this room the thing you\u2019ll see was an obvious reference to Fantastic Four member The Thing, who\u2019s made entirely of\u2026\nPenny: Shut up. I solved it.\nSheldon: Those are map coordinates. Got \u2019em. Let\u2019s go.\nPenny: Well, wait. Don\u2019t you want to know how I figured it out?\nSheldon: No one likes a know-it-all, Penny.\nScene: Howard\u2019s car.\nHoward: On the boats and on the planes. \nAmy: They\u2019re coming to America. \nHoward: Never looking back again. \nAmy: They\u2019re coming to America\u2026 \u266a\nScene: Leonard\u2019s car.\nLeonard: Um, I\u2019m okay with you driving my car. I\u2019m not okay with you flying my car.\nBernadette: Don\u2019t sweat it, my dad\u2019s a cop. He can fix things.\nLeonard: Uh-huh. Like death?\nBernadette (out of the window): Your kid may be an honour student but you\u2019re a moron.\nLeonard: Penny\u2019s not answering my texts.\nBernadette: Who cares? Focus on the game.\nLeonard: This stupid game is why she\u2019s mad in the first place. I\u2019m telling her I\u2019m quitting.\nBernadette: No. Quitting would be the worst thing for your relationship.\nLeonard: Why?\nBernadette: Because it would make you seem like something she already thinks you are. \nLeonard: What does she think I am?\nBernadette: How do I put this? She\u2019s been known to call you a name that usually applies to a lady part. Or a cat. Or a willow.\nLeonard: I can\u2019t believe she would say that about me.\nBernadette: If you\u2019re gonna cry about it there\u2019s tissues in my purse. Unless you got some in yours. Big willow.\nScene: Howard\u2019s car.\nHoward: They\u2019re coming to America, They\u2019re coming to America.\nAmy: Today!\nHoward: Today!\nTogether: Today! Today!\nScene: Penny\u2019s car.\nSheldon: Okay, another 30 feet.\nPenny: Okay. Oh, it\u2019s a bowling alley.\nSheldon: Yes. Yes. My brain is better than everybody\u2019s.\nScene: The geology lab.\nHoward: Love on the rocks. \nAmy: Ain\u2019t no big surprise.\nHoward: Just pour me a drink.\nAmy: And I\u2019ll tell you some lies. \nScene: The apartment stairwell. Leonard is lowering himself down the lift shaft.\nLeonard: Call me a lady part. We\u2019ll see about that.\nBernadette: Can you reach the clue?\nLeonard: Almost.\nBernadette: Hurry, Sheldon and Penny were right behind us in the bowling alley.\nLeonard: Got it.\nBernadette: Great, climb back up. Come on.\nLeonard: Yeah, Penny might be onto something.\nScene: Penny\u2019s car. \nSheldon: To the planetarium.\nPenny: Let\u2019s go.\nScene: Leonard\u2019s car.\nLeonard: To the tar pits.\nBernadette: Let\u2019s go.\nScene: Howard\u2019s car.\nAmy: There\u2019s a Neil Diamond concert next month.\nHoward: Let\u2019s go.\nScene: The laundry room.\nPenny: Three bags, no one\u2019s opened \u2019em. we\u2019re the first ones here.\nSheldon: It\u2019s dirty laundry. You\u2019re up.\nPenny: What? Why me?\nSheldon: Because you\u2019ve been training for this your whole life. You live in a pile of dirty laundry.\nBernadette: They\u2019re here first. This is because you made me slow down for that blind guy.\nPenny: Okay, the clue must be in the bag.\nLeonard: The clue must be in the bag.\nPenny: It\u2019s just a bunch of pants.\nLeonard: It\u2019s just a bunch of pants.\nPenny: You know, I\u2019m surprised you want to copy my answers since I\u2019m not even smart enough to be on your team. \nLeonard: Well, why would you want to be on someone\u2019s team who you like to call a, I can\u2019t even say it in front of Sheldon.\nPenny: What are you talking about?\nLeonard: You know exactly what I\u2019m talking about.\nBernadette: No, she doesn\u2019t. I just made that up.\nLeonard: Why would you do that?\nBernadette: Because you were about to quit like a big, Sheldon, cover your ears.\nSheldon: I\u2019m not a child. I know the word ninny.\nPenny: Yeah, well, you should have quit \u2019cause I\u2019m still gonna beat your ass.\nBernadette: Wish I had a man like her on my team.\nLeonard: Hey, I am every bit as much of a man as Penny. Now, let\u2019s do this.\nSheldon: Wait, it\u2019s not all pants, there\u2019s one shirt.\nPenny: Oh.\nSheldon: Hey, that\u2019s my shirt.\nLeonard: This one is, too.\nSheldon: No, no, that\u2019s not mine. It has a big spot on it.\nPenny: But wait. So does this one.\nBernadette: Maybe the spot\u2019s the clue.\nPenny: Sheldon\u2019s spot. The coin is in your spot.\nSheldon: Oh, that\u2019s clever.\nPenny (off): Hurry.\nSheldon: Be there in a minute. I just have to pre-soak these.\nScene: The stairwell.\nBernadette: Stop her, Leonard, stop her.\nPenny: Well, where the hell\u2019s the coin?\nLeonard: Wasn\u2019t the answer Sheldon\u2019s spot?\nRaj: Oh, yes, Leonard. Yes, it was.\nBernadette: Then where\u2019s the coin?\nRaj: Yes, exactly. Where is the coin? Why don\u2019t you look in your pockets? I slipped them in there earlier today.\nPenny: I don\u2019t get it.\nRaj: Don\u2019t you see? When we\u2019re all having fun together, we\u2019re already winners. Oh, look. See? Even I\u2019m a winner.\nLeonard: Are you kidding me?\nPenny: That is the stupidest thing I\u2019ve ever heard. \nBernadette: You suck so hard.\nRaj: Well, I thought\u2026 Come on, I didn\u2019t want anyone to feel bad at the end of the game. And some of those puzzles were really hard and I didn\u2019t know who was gonna get Penny.\nPenny: Run.\nRaj: Okay, okay, that-that came out wrong, but you have to admit, you all had a wonderful time.\nPenny: Run to India.\nRaj: I just wanted to do something beautiful.\nSheldon (entering): Hey, look. I won.\nScene: The Cheesecake Factory, karaoke night.\nHoward: Hey, she got the way to move me, Cherry,\nAmy: She got the way to groove me.\nHoward: Cherry, baby\nAmy: She got the way to move me, honey.\nTogether: She got the way to groove me. She got the way to move me.\nHoward: Cherry\nTogether: She got the way to groove me, yeah!\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "7_7": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: A supermarket\nAmy: I\u2019ve never seen him this happy before.\nLeonard: That\u2019s because you\u2019ve never seen him on restock the medicine cabinet day.\nSheldon: Look. A new topical antihistamine with lidocaine. Wow. I can\u2019t wait until I get a rash. \nLeonard: Oh, Gas-X has a new ultra strength. I guess they really do read their mail.\nSheldon: Hey, isn\u2019t that Professor Proton?\nLeonard: Oh, yeah.\nSheldon: Look at him, just standing in line like he wasn\u2019t moderately famous 30 years ago. Let\u2019s go say hello.\nLeonard: Oh, maybe we shouldn\u2019t bother him.\nSheldon: I\u2019m not going to bother him, I\u2019m going to talk to him.\nLeonard: He thinks there\u2019s a difference.\nSheldon: Arthur? Arthur, it\u2019s me, Sheldon Cooper. You may not remember because of your advanced age.\nArthur: Trust me, I, I remember.\nSheldon: This is my girlfriend, Amy. Amy, this is television legend Arthur Jeffries. His science show inspired millions of children.\nArthur: Hold, hold, hold on. You, you have a girlfriend?\nAmy: Yes, and I\u2019ve heard so much about you. Hey look, we\u2019re wearing the same orthopaedic shoes. I can\u2019t believe I dress like a celebrity.\nArthur: Oh, okay, I get it now.\nLeonard: Dr. Jeffries, hello again. Leonard Hofstadter.\nArthur: Oh, oh, right, I remember your, your girlfriend. Is, is she, is she here?\nLeonard: No, she\u2019s not.\nSheldon: So, what prescription are you getting filled?\nLeonard: Sheldon.\nSheldon: No. Wait, I want to guess. Don\u2019t tell me.\nArthur: I wasn\u2019t going to tell you.\nAmy: Sheldon, come on.\nSheldon: No, no, no. I\u2019m really good at this. All right, give me a hint. Does it involve difficulty initiating a stream of anything?\nArthur: Well, given my age, that\u2019s more than just a lucky guess.\nLeonard: Hey, Sheldon, let\u2019s go mock the people buying homeopathic medicine, you love that.\nSheldon: But I\u2019m hanging out with my friend, and we\u2019re having fun. Look how happy he is.\nCredits sequence. \nThe cafeteria.\nHoward: Bernie\u2019s having a girls\u2019 night on Friday at our place. You want to do something?\nRaj: Actually, I\u2019m busy.\nHoward: Doing what?\nRaj: There\u2019s a new sports bar over on Colorado Ave\u2026\nHoward: You\u2019re going to girls\u2019 night.\nRaj: Yeah.\nHoward: You know they\u2019re making jewellery right?\nRaj: You think they came up with that? They were going to drink beer and play darts.\nLeonard: What\u2019s up?\nHoward: Not his testosterone levels.\nRaj: Excuse me. I happen to be very comfortable with my masculinity.\nHoward: How is that possible?\nLeonard: Hey, I got an email from Professor Proton.\nSheldon: Goody. What\u2019s it say?\nLeonard: He\u2019s working on a paper about nano vacuum tubes, and wants to know if I\u2019d take a look at it.\nSheldon: That\u2019s strange. That he would come to you for that and not me. Oh, I got two emails from him. Do you have Leonard\u2019s email address? And. Never mind, I found it. I can\u2019t believe he picked you over me.\nHoward: You don\u2019t want to read a paper by some old has-been who hasn\u2019t done any real science in decades.\nRaj: Yeah, it\u2019s nothing to cry about.\nSheldon: Sheldon Cooper does not cry.\nHoward: It\u2019s true, you\u2019d rust.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: And to think I idolized that man. And why? At the end of the day he\u2019s just another Hollywood phony.\nAmy: Is it really worth getting upset about?\nSheldon: Yeah, they say don\u2019t meet your heroes. Don\u2019t peek behind that curtain of fame and celebrity, because if you do, you\u2019ll see them as they really are, degenerate carnival folk.\nAmy: Come on, he\u2019s a retired kids show host.\nSheldon: That\u2019s even worse. Using the sweet candy of science to trick children into loving him. Pervert.\nAmy: Have you ever thought about why Arthur didn\u2019t want you to read his paper?\nSheldon: Yes, I have. And my only conclusion is the prescription he was picking up the other day was for cuckoo pills.\nAmy: Maybe he found you, um, a bit much.\nSheldon: That\u2019s kind of a stretch. Look, when it comes to social skills, I\u2019ve mastered the big three. There\u2019s the coy smile. There\u2019s the friendly chuckle. There\u2019s the vocalization of sympathy. Aw. That last one\u2019s tricky, I\u2019m still working on it.\nAmy: From what I saw the other day, I could understand why he and some people might find you\u2026\nSheldon: What?\nAmy: Doesn\u2019t matter.\nSheldon: No, go ahead, say it. I know what it is. I\u2019ve heard it my whole life. The word\u2019s annoying. Go ahead, say it. Say it. Say I\u2019m annoying.\nAmy: Sheldon.\nSheldon: Oh, it won\u2019t hurt my feelings. Go ahead, Amy, say I\u2019m annoying. I\u2019m annoying. I\u2019m annoying. I\u2019m annoying. Yeah, now, uh, now where are you going? Look, you know you want to say it, say it. Say I\u2019m annoying. Go ahead, say it. Say it. Say it. Amy, say it. Well, she can\u2019t stand it when I\u2019m right.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s apartment. \nAmy: This is fun. I\u2019m going to feel like such a vixen wearing jewellery that doesn\u2019t have a list of medications I\u2019m allergic to.\nRaj: Penny, how\u2019s it going over there?\nPenny: Good, I\u2019m just having little trouble with the glue.\nAmy: How do you not know how to use glue? Did you ditch pre-school?\nPenny: Yeah, but only because I was dating a second grader.\nHoward: Hello, everyone.\nRaj: Okay, let me have it. Let\u2019s hear all the Raj is a girl jokes.\nHoward: Nope. Bernadette told me it isn\u2019t nice and I\u2019m not allowed.\nRaj: Thank you.\nHoward: So I won\u2019t be making fun of you, or the things you like, or the fact that you just want to have fu-un.\nBernadette: Howie, stop. Come on, look at what I\u2019m making.\nHoward: Oh, that\u2019s actually pretty nice.\nAmy: I\u2019m making a bracelet.\nPenny: Yeah, I\u2019m just making a mess.\nHoward: You know, instead of beads and glue, you guys can use my soldering iron. You\u2019d be able to make much cooler stuff.\nRaj: Oh, I think we\u2019re doing just fine, thank you.\nAmy: Actually, I\u2019d kind of like to try that.\nBernadette: Me, too.\nHoward: Be right back.\nPenny: When did I have pistachios?\nScene: Professor Proton\u2019s house. \nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Arthur. (Knock, knock, knock) Arthur. (Knock, knock, knock) Arthur. Door knocker. That\u2019s TV money.\nArthur: Sheldon, what are you doing here?\nSheldon: I\u2019m sorry, did I wake you?\nArthur: Of course you woke me, it\u2019s seven thirty.\nSheldon: Well, I would have been here sooner, but for some reason your home isn\u2019t on this map of Hollywood stars.\nArthur: What do you want, Sheldon?\nSheldon: It\u2019s been pointed out by my girlfriend that I may have been annoying to you.\nArthur: She sounds like a keeper.\nSheldon: Anyway, I wanted to apologize. I am truly sorry.\nArthur: All right, apology accepted. Have a nice night.\nSheldon: No, no, now that we\u2019ve cleared the air, I wanted to discuss another matter with you.\nArthur: Sheldon, in a couple hours I have to get up, pee and then wander around the house.\nSheldon: Well, then, I\u2019ll make this quick. Um, I want to talk about the paper you sent Leonard. Now, I know he said it\u2019s promising and he\u2019s going to collaborate on it, but now that you and I are friends again, I am at your disposal. And, um, frankly, lending my name and reputation to it will help, because a lot of people think that you\u2019re a washed-up has-been. Or dead.\nArthur: I should be so lucky.\nSheldon: So, uh, what do you say?\nArthur: You know, if it\u2019s all the same with you, I, I think I\u2019ll, I\u2019ll stick with Leonard.\nSheldon: It\u2019s because I\u2019m annoying, right? I know it is. Say it. Say it. Say I\u2019m annoying. \nArthur: Good night.\nSheldon: Say it. Arthur, say it. Say I\u2019m annoying. Say it. Say it. I\u2019m annoying. Say it. \nArthur: You\u2019re annoying.\nSheldon: Well, that really hurt. \nScene: Leonard\u2019s laboratory. \nLeonard: If you would have told me when I was a kid that someday I would be doing science next to Professor Proton, I would not have believed you.\nArthur: If someone had told me that people would still call me Professor Proton when I was 83 years old, I never would have quit smoking.\nLeonard: I\u2019m sorry, Dr. Jeffries, I\u2019m just excited. This nano vacuum tube idea of yours is, it\u2019s really interesting.\nSheldon: Hello, Leonard. Oh, hello, Arthur. What an odd coincidence that you\u2019re both here.\nLeonard: Why is it odd?\nSheldon: Because as it just so happens, I\u2019m also spending the day with a beloved children\u2019s television science personality. Isn\u2019t that right, new friend and colleague Bill Nye the Science Guy. Sorry, I replaced you with a newer model.\nBill Nye: Wow, Arthur Jeffries. It\u2019s an honour to meet you. My show never would have happened without yours.\nArthur: That\u2019s what I told my lawyers.\nLeonard: Mr. Nye, hello. I\u2019m sorry he got you involved in this nonsense.\nBill: He said I\u2019d be speaking to a class.\nSheldon: No, I said you were teaching someone a lesson. Now let\u2019s go.\nBill: What are you guys working on?\nLeonard: Oh, uh, we\u2019re making nano vacuum tubes.\nBill: Oh, that\u2019s interesting.\nArthur: Haven\u2019t you stolen enough from me? Back off, bow tie.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment. \nPenny: Hey, guys, what do you think?\nAmy: Wow, Penny, good job.\nPenny: Thanks. Target, four ninety-nine. I\u2019m getting a drink.\nAmy: What are you working on?\nRaj: Ah, I\u2019m making a necklace for my mom. \nAmy: That\u2019s sweet.\nRaj: Yeah, she and my dad are going through a bit of a rough patch, so I wanted to do something to let her know I was thinking about her.\nPenny: What\u2019s going on with them?\nRaj: They\u2019re just having a little trouble communicating. My dad says it\u2019s because the sound of my mom\u2019s voice makes him want to tear his ears off and sew them over his eyes so he never has to look at her again.\nBernadette: Hi.\nPenny: Hey, guys.\nAmy: Hello.\nHoward: Look who\u2019s here to put the Jew in jewellery night.\nBernadette: Oh, sure, so it\u2019s fine when you say it.\nHoward: Sorry we\u2019re late. I wanted to swing by the lab and pick up some even cooler tools for us to use.\nRaj: I didn\u2019t know you were coming again.\nHoward: Well, last week was a blast. Plus, I thought you might like having a guy here. \nPenny (laughing): It was not funny.\nAmy: So, what tools did you bring?\nHoward: Everything we need to make jewellery moulds. Here\u2019s some silver, a crucible and an acetylene torch to melt it down.\nPenny: Ooh, that looks like fun.\nBernadette: Maybe you should master glue before you move on to fire.\nHoward: Okay, who\u2019s up first?\nAmy: Rajesh, do you want to make a bracelet for your mom to go with the necklace?\nRaj: No, thanks.\nHoward: I was gonna make a necklace for my mom, but unfortunately she doesn\u2019t have a neck. She\u2019s just chins and fat and feet.\nScene: Leonard\u2019s laboratory.\nLeonard: Okay, we\u2019re almost ready to go. Once we bond the wires, we can test the tubes.\nArthur: This is so exciting, I, I feel like I\u2019m 75 again.\nLeonard: Oh, God.\nArthur: What, what is it?\nLeonard: Sheldon just sent me a picture of him and Bill Nye getting smoothies.\nArthur: Can, can I ask you a question?\nLeonard: Yeah, sure.\nArthur: Why do you put up with Sheldon?\nLeonard: Oh, uh, you know, because we\u2019re friends.\nArthur: Why?\nLeonard: Wow, you ask really hard questions.\nArthur: Yeah.\nLeonard: Look, I know he can be aggravating, but what you have to remember is that he\u2019s not doing it on purpose. It\u2019s just how he is. But he\u2019s also loyal and trustworthy and we have fun together.\nArthur: You, you know you\u2019re describing a dog.\nLeonard: He did bite me once. But in his defence, I came up behind him while he was eating, so\u2026\nArthur: Yeah, they, they hate that.\nLeonard: You know what, Sheldon is the smartest person I have ever met. And he\u2019s a little broken and he needs me. I guess I need him, too.\nArthur: Why, why is that?\nLeonard: Boy, you will not let this go, will you? Oh, jeez.\nArthur: Another photo from Sheldon?\nLeonard: No, I have to go pick him up. Bill Nye ditched him at the smoothie place.\nArthur: He probably stole his wallet, too.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment. \nHoward: You know, if you guys are interested, there\u2019s a technique where I can take a lock of your hair, refine it into carbon dust and use the hydraulic press at work to turn it into a tiny little diamond with your DNA in it.\nPenny: Oh, that\u2019s amazing,\nHoward: Yeah. See Bernie\u2019s engagement ring? That came right off my mom\u2019s back.\nBernadette: He\u2019s kidding. If that were true, it\u2019d be so much bigger.\nRaj: My name is Howard. I can make your hair into diamonds. My mom is morbidly obese. Everybody love me.\nHoward: Whoa, where is that coming from?\nRaj: I\u2019ll tell you where it\u2019s coming from. All you do is make fun of me for coming to girls\u2019 night and now you\u2019re here ruining it for everyone.\nPenny: Raj, cool it, he\u2019s gonna make us hair diamonds.\nHoward: How am I ruining anything? I\u2019m just trying to help you make better jewellery.\nRaj: But this isn\u2019t about the jewellery. This is about me having a place where I can open up about my feelings.\nHoward: Since when can\u2019t you open up with me?\nRaj: There are just some things that I feel more comfortable sharing with the girls, because they won\u2019t make fun of me or and call me names, or ask me if my Koothrapanties are in a bunch.\nHoward: Buddy, I was just joking around. \nRaj: Yeah, well, sometimes your jokes hurt. \nHoward: You\u2019re right. I didn\u2019t realize I was making you feel that way. It was very brave of you to tell me.\nRaj: Thank you. It wasn\u2019t easy.\nAmy: They\u2019re gonna have sex before Sheldon and I do, I know it.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Arthur?\nArthur: Hi, Sheldon.\nSheldon: I\u2019m surprised to see you here.\nArthur: Yeah, me, too. Somewhere around the third floor I began to see a, a white light.\nSheldon: I\u2019ll get Leonard.\nArthur: No, no, no, I\u2019m, I\u2019m here, I\u2019m here to see you.\nSheldon: If you\u2019re hoping to get in touch with Bill Nye, I can\u2019t help you. I\u2019ve been informed that he\u2019s now Bill Nye the Restraining Order Guy.\nArthur: No, I, I, I was thinking, if it isn\u2019t too much trouble, I\u2019d like to get your opinion about my, my paper.\nSheldon: Thank you. It would be an honour.\nArthur: Oh. Uh, great.\nSheldon: Actually, I don\u2019t need that. I hacked into your e-mail account and read it.\nArthur: And, what did you think?\nSheldon: Well, first, I think the fact that you use your birthday as a password is embarrassing. \nArthur: Mmm. Thank you.\nSheldon: Second, um, I thought your paper was inspired. \nArthur: Oh, well, that, that means a lot to me.\nSheldon: Can I invite you in for tea?\nArthur: Uh, no, no. I, I really, I have, I have to run.\nPenny: Hey, Arthur. How are you?\nArthur: Well, I guess one cup wouldn\u2019t hurt.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s apartment.\nHoward: Oh, hey, buddy, what\u2019s up?\nRaj: Well, I was feeling bad about how I acted the other night so I made you a little something.\nHoward: You didn\u2019t have to do that.\nRaj: Well, it was fun. I used some of the jewellery techniques you taught us. It\u2019s a lightsabre belt buckle.\nHoward: Wow, this is so cool. Thanks.\nRaj: Oh gets better.\nHoward: Wow.\nRaj: And that\u2019s not even the best part. See? I have one, too. Check it out. You can wear yours and we can have little sword fights whenever we want.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Yeah, and my eighth favourite episode of Professor Proton was Alka-Seltzer rocket. You said, plop, plop, fizz, fizz, oh, what a blast-off it is. Remember? Remember that? Remember?\nLeonard: He can\u2019t help it. He can\u2019t. He really can\u2019t.\nSheldon: Oh, wait here. I\u2019ll get some Alka-Seltzer, we can build that rocket, and we can shoot it at Bill Nye\u2019s house. As long as I\u2019m not within 500 feet of it.\nArthur: So, you, uh, you have, you have any, single grandmothers?\nPenny: Sorry, they\u2019re both married.\nArthur: Good.\nPenny: Mmm.\nArthur: Hap, hap, happily?\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "8_2": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: I recently read that during World War Two, Joseph Stalin had a research program to create supersoldiers by having women impregnated by gorillas.\nHoward: What a sick use of science.\nRaj: Hey, as long as the baby\u2019s healthy.\nAmy: I wonder if Stalin considered any other animals.\nLeonard: Hippos are the deadliest creature. A half-human, half-hippo soldier would be pretty badass.\nHoward: Yes, but when they\u2019re hungry-hungry, you can stop them with marbles.\nSheldon: Yeah, the correct animal for interspecies supersolider is koala. You would wind up with an army so cute it couldn\u2019t be attacked.\nRaj: But half-man, half-owl could fly\u2026\nSheldon: The answer is cuddly soldiers with big flat noses. Moving on.\nHoward: So, Penny, when\u2019s the new job start?\nPenny: Next Monday.\nBernadette: Did you get a chance to look over the materials I gave you?\nPenny: Uh, not yet, but I will.\nBernadette: Great. When?\nPenny: I said I\u2019ll get to it.\nSheldon: I\u2019m sensing awkwardness, am I right?\nAmy: Yes.\nSheldon: Swish.\nBernadette: I don\u2019t want to be pushy, but you\u2019ve never done pharmaceutical sales before. It seems like you could use this time to get a head start.\nPenny: Well, the first few weeks will be all training. They\u2019ll tell me everything I need to know.\nBernadette: But imagine how impressed they\u2019d be if you showed up already familiar with the material.\nPenny: Okay, so what, you want me to be like a teacher\u2019s pet?\nBernadette: Couldn\u2019t hurt.\nLeonard: Mm, I don\u2019t know. Who here has ever been hurt because they were the teacher\u2019s pet?\nSheldon: It was like the rest of the class wanted Ms. McDonald to forget the quiz.\nScene: Mrs Davis\u2019 office.\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Mrs. Davis. (Knock, knock, knock) Guess who?\nMrs Davis: Dr. Cooper.\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) That\u2019s right, good job. Hello. Uh, you wanted to see me?\nMrs Davis: Yes. Uh, welcome back.\nSheldon: Thank you. I assume you\u2019d like to reopen our dialogue about the university forcing me to continue with string theory?\nMrs Davis: You mean the dialogue that went, please, no, please, no, please, no.\nSheldon: That\u2019s the one. I believe you went last, so, uh, please?\nMrs Davis: Dr. Cooper, while you were away, we came up with a solution that would allow you to change your field of study.\nSheldon: Wow. Pouting and running away actually worked. I must say, that may not be a lesson you want to reinforce with me. So, um, what is the solution?\nMrs Davis: Currently, you\u2019re being paid under a grant to specifically research string theory. If we promote you to junior professor, you\u2019ll be able to choose whatever field of research you\u2019d like.\nSheldon: But if I\u2019m a professor, then I\u2019ll have to teach a class.\nMrs Davis: That is correct.\nSheldon: So your solution is to promote me and pay me more money so that I can impart my knowledge to the next generation of scientists?\nMrs Davis: Yes.\nSheldon: You people are sick.\nScene: Amy\u2019s lab.\nPenny: Hey. Ready to go to lunch?\nAmy: Just give me a minute. I\u2019m stimulating the pleasure cells of this starfish. I just need to turn it off.\nPenny: What happens if you don\u2019t?\nAmy: Then I have to sit through lunch knowing this starfish is having a better day than I am. Is Bernadette meeting us at the restaurant?\nPenny: Uh, no. Actually, I didn\u2019t invite her.\nAmy: How come?\nPenny: Well, ever since she helped me get this job, she won\u2019t stop bugging me.\nAmy: Well, I think she just wants you to do well, and she\u2019s worried that you won\u2019t \u2019cause you were just a stunningly poor waitress.\nPenny: That is not true.\nAmy: I\u2019m still waiting on my mini corndogs from two years ago.\nPenny: I told you, they\u2019ll be right out.\nAmy: Okay, so no Bernadette.\nPenny: Well, you saw her the other night. Am I wrong?\nAmy: No, I just, I feel kind of uncomfortable talking about her like this. Usually when someone\u2019s being talked about behind their back, it\u2019s me and it\u2019s right in front of my face.\nPenny: I\u2019m sorry. I just need a little break from her.\nAmy: I understand. You know, there is some research that indicates that sharing negative attitudes about a third party can be a powerful bonding force between two friends.\nPenny: So, what are you saying?\nAmy: I\u2019m saying, in the spirit of science, what is that little skank\u2019s problem?\nScene: The cafeteria.\nRaj: So, I\u2019ve been trying to come up with a cute couple\u2019s nickname for me and Emily. What do you like better? Emippali or Koothrapemily?\nHoward: Why is it your last name and her first name?\nRaj: Oh, well, her last name is Sweeney, and something just didn\u2019t seem right about Koothrapeeney.\nLeonard: Hey, how\u2019d it go with human resources?\nSheldon: Awful. They\u2019re allowing me to move on from string theory, but they made me a junior professor and are requiring me to teach a class.\nRaj: I don\u2019t understand. Why is it bad that you have to teach?\nSheldon: What a stupid question.\nLeonard: The kids are gonna love him.\nSheldon: I can\u2019t believe I have to waste my time babysitting a bunch of grad students who probably think dark matter is what\u2019s in their diapers.\nLeonard: This might not be that bad. Uh, you like telling people they\u2019re wrong.\nSheldon: Wrong, Just because I enjoyed that one doesn\u2019t mean I always do.\nRaj: You enjoy giving people grades.\nSheldon: A valid point, but unoriginal. B-minus.\nHoward: And you love the sound of your own voice.\nSheldon: Yeah, well, of course I do. Listen to it. It\u2019s like an earful of melted caramel.\nLeonard: Look, most importantly, this will let you move on and study dark matter.\nSheldon: It is true that many of my heroes have taken students under their wings. Feynman, Einstein, Professor X. Humorously, in the case of Professor X, some of his students actually had wings. That\u2019s rich. I\u2019ll use that one to lighten the mood after my entire class fails the midterm.\nScene: Amy\u2019s lab.\nAmy: Measuring starfish serotonin levels in response to one point two molar stimulation of pleasure cells. You like that, don\u2019t you? That\u2019s right, say my name.\nBernadette (on skype): Hey.\nAmy: Hey, what\u2019s going on?\nBernadette: Not much. You want to get a drink later? Just the two of us?\nAmy: No Penny?\nBernadette: Not tonight. I\u2019m a little frustrated with her.\nAmy: Because you got her the job and you think she should be working harder to prepare for it?\nBernadette: So it\u2019s not just me. You see it, too.\nAmy: I do, I see it.\nBernadette: It\u2019s driving me crazy. Just this afternoon, I saw on Instagram that instead of studying, she went out to lunch and got a manicure.\nAmy: That\u2019s outrageous.\nBernadette: I know.\nAmy: If she doesn\u2019t do well, this could reflect poorly on you.\nBernadette: Exactly. Does she not realize it or does she not care?\nAmy: I don\u2019t know. The important thing is I am here for you so we can mutually disparage this unpleasing third party.\nScene: Sheldon\u2019s classroom.\nLeonard: Hey. We just wanted to see how your class was going. Where is everybody?\nSheldon: There is no class.\nHoward: Did you send everyone to the principal\u2019s office already?\nSheldon: No one signed up.\nLeonard: Well, that\u2019s not your fault.\nSheldon: I called the department secretary to see what happened. Apparently, I have a reputation for being obnoxious.\nLeonard: What?\nRaj: Hey, Sheldon, I\u2019m sorry.\nSheldon: No, it\u2019s fine. Now I can devote all my time to dark matter.\nRaj: Aw, you brought cookies for everyone?\nSheldon: Oh, yes. Fig Newtons. I was going to ask them which scientist both helped to develop calculus and had a famous cookie named after him? And then after someone said Newton, I was going to tell them they\u2019re wrong. The cookies are named after a town in Massachusetts. And then I\u2019d throw the cookies away.\nHoward: Hey, what if I took your class?\nSheldon: Why would you do that?\nLeonard: Yeah, why would you do that?\nRaj: What\u2019s wrong with you?\nHoward: I\u2019m thinking about getting my doctorate, and he wants to teach. Why not?\nSheldon: Oh, Howard. I appreciate the gesture, but this is a graduate-level physics class. I don\u2019t think you\u2019d understand a single thing I was talking about.\nRaj: Ask why not again, I\u2019ve got an answer.\nHoward: Sheldon, I\u2019m more than smart enough to take your class.\nSheldon: No.\nHoward: Yes.\nSheldon: How would you determine the ground state of a quantum system with no exact solution?\nHoward: I would guess a wave-function and then vary its parameters until I found the lowest energy solution.\nSheldon: Hmm. Do you know how to integrate X squared times E to the minus X, without looking it up?\nHoward: I\u2019d use Feynman\u2019s trick, differentiate under the integral sign.\nSheldon: Okay. Um, what is the correct interpretation of quantum mechanics?\nHoward: Since every interpretation gives exactly the same answer to every measurement, they are all equally correct. However, I know you believe in the Many Worlds Interpretation, so I\u2019ll say that. Now do you think I\u2019m smart enough?\nSheldon: No.\nHoward: Oh, come on. You might\u2019ve gone to school for a couple more years than me, but guess what, engineers are just as smart as physicists.\nSheldon: You take that back.\nHoward: No.\nScene: The stairwell.\nAmy: So, after drinks with Bernadette, I get home, and Penny calls to complain about her. And then while I\u2019m talking to Penny, I get a text from Bernadette.\nSheldon: I am trying to prepare my lesson plan for Howard. Why are you telling me this?\nAmy: Because it\u2019s taken 15 years, but high school is finally awesome. I love them both, but I\u2019m in the centre now, and I love that even more.\nSheldon: Amy, please. I am trying to figure out a way to intellectually emasculate a dear friend of mine.\nAmy: But I\u2019m just\u2026\nSheldon: Not now.\nAmy: You better watch that attitude, buddy. You\u2019re dating the popular girl now.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: Hmm. You\u2019re up late.\nSheldon: Oh, I\u2019m working on my lesson plan for Wolowitz. He is going to be so lost. Look at this section over here. Even I don\u2019t really understand it.\nLeonard: Sheldon, why are you doing this?\nSheldon: I\u2019m a teacher, Leonard. It\u2019s my job.\nLeonard: No, I mean, why are you going to so much trouble to prove that you\u2019re smarter than Wolowitz?\nSheldon: Oh, it\u2019s no trouble, it\u2019s actually a pleasure.\nLeonard: You want to know what I think? I think the idea that someone could be as smart as you, or even smarter, scares the pants off you, and you can\u2019t deal with it.\nSheldon: Interesting point. You\u2019re suggesting that I have emotional issues below my consciousness which drive my behaviour, thus causing me to lash out at anything or anyone that threatens my intellectual superiority.\nLeonard: Might be something to think about.\nSheldon: Leonard?\nLeonard: Yeah.\nSheldon: Howard\u2019s allergic to peanuts. How can I use that against him?\nScene: Sheldon\u2019s classroom.\nHoward: Hey.\nSheldon: Okay, now that everyone\u2019s here, we can begin.\nHoward: Before we do, I just talked to Leonard. And if you\u2019re gonna spend all your time trying to belittle me by making this class unnecessarily hard, then I\u2019m out. But if you\u2019re interested in making a sincere effort to be a good teacher, then I\u2019m willing to give this a shot.\nSheldon: I suppose that\u2019s a fair request. There\u2019s no reason we both can\u2019t benefit from this experience.\nHoward: Okay.\nSheldon: Okay. Well, then, uh, first things first. Um, are you familiar with the Brachistochrone problem?\nHoward: I am.\nSheldon: Good. And how it relates to the calculus of variations?\nHoward: It\u2019s an inverted cycloid.\nSheldon: Wonderful. Now, what about Euler-Lagrange theorems?\nHoward: That\u2019s where I\u2019m a little fuzzy.\nSheldon: Ha! I knew it. All right. We have a lot of information to cover before your first test. Which, by the way, is in eight minutes. The good news is I\u2019m grading on a curve, so you\u2019re pretty much guaranteed a C.\nHoward (singing): All I do is win, win, win no matter what.\nSheldon: What are you doing?\nHoward (singing): Everybody hands go up, up and they stay there!\nSheldon: What are you doing?\nHoward: If you\u2019re gonna be a crappy teacher, then I\u2019m gonna be a crappy student. (Singing) Uh, uh, Ludacris going in on the verse. \u2019cause I never been defeated and I won\u2019t stop now\u2026\nSheldon: Will you stop it. This is a classroom. This is not American Bandstand.\nHoward: Okay.\nSheldon: Now, where was I? Let\u2019s see. Oh, yes. Over here. You\u2026 What are you doing now?\nHoward: Making a straw.\nSheldon: Why?\nHoward: So I can shoot you with a spitball.\nSheldon: You\u2019re not going to do that, and I\u2019ll tell you why. This is an institution of higher learning, I am your professor, and you\u2019re going to treat me with the prop\u2026 You shot your spit in my mouth!\nHoward: Is that gonna be on the test? Because I don\u2019t think I can do that again.\nScene: Amy\u2019s lab.\nAmy (on phone): Hey, girlfriend. Can I get a what what?\nPenny: What?\nAmy: Close enough. Um, I was just calling to see what you were up tonight. Thought maybe we could hit up Color Me Mine, maybe sneak in some Pinot Greej. Whatevs.\nPenny: Uh, thanks, but I think I\u2019m gonna stay in and go over the stuff Bernadette gave me.\nAmy: Oh. Oh, I hear you. Try and get that nag off your back, right? I mean, you\u2019re not a bicycle, why\u2019s she riding you like that?\nPenny: No, I think she was just trying to help. Plus, I really want to do well at this job. So\u2026\nAmy: Okay, good luck. And call me later, you know, if you decide she\u2019s a bitch or something. Hey, girlfriend.\nBernadette: Hey, Amy.\nAmy: Tonight. You, me, Color Me Mine. Maybe we sneak in some Pinot, make it Color Me Wine.\nBernadette: That sounds fun, but I promised Penny I\u2019d come by and help her study.\nAmy: Oh. Well, good luck getting her to do that. She\u2019s probably off getting another manicure. You remember when she did that? You remember?\nBernadette: I was probably being too hard on her. We talked, we\u2019re good.\nAmy: Oh. Great. I\u2019m happy for you guys. You know, when the two of you aren\u2019t getting along, it puts me in a really weird position.\nBernadette: Well, don\u2019t worry, everything\u2019s back to normal.\nAmy: You mean, like, where she\u2019s nice to your face? Okay got it. Bye. Hey, boyfriend.\nSheldon: Can\u2019t talk. Spitball. Probably gonna die.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Well?\nLeonard: Sheldon, I promise. Your uvula does not have an STD.\nSheldon: Are you sure? It just doesn\u2019t feel as innocent as it used to.\nHoward: You reported me to human resources?\nSheldon: You violated the sanctity of my mouth.\nHoward: Well, I dropped your class, so I hope you\u2019re happy.\nSheldon: I told you you weren\u2019t smart enough to take it.\nHoward: I\u2019m smart enough, Sheldon. Asking me a bunch of questions about a topic I\u2019m not familiar with doesn\u2019t prove anything. I could do the same to you.\nSheldon: Yeah, try me.\nHoward: Okay. You enjoy making fun of engineering so much, how do you quantify the strength of materials?\nSheldon: Young\u2019s modulus.\nRaj: Is that right?\nHoward: Yeah. Okay, how do you prevent eddy currents in a transformer?\nSheldon: Laminate the core material.\nLeonard: Come on, give him a hard one.\nHoward: That was a hard one. All right. How does the flow rate in a pipe depend on its diameter? You don\u2019t know, do you? What\u2019s the matter, smart guy? Don\u2019t know Poiseuille\u2019s law?\nSheldon (coughing several times): Thank goodness I got it. Now I can quit checking my stool.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment.\nBernadette: Okay, what are the potential side effects for our erectile dysfunction drug?\nPenny: Headaches, dizziness and nausea.\nBernadette: Yes.\nPenny: Those are also the side effects of having a 75-year-old man with an erection climb on top of you.\nBernadette: Want to stop here?\nPenny: Uh, no. I can keep going.\nBernadette: Nah, you got this. Let\u2019s go for a drink. I\u2019ll call Amy.\nPenny: Okay, good. She seemed like she really wanted to go out tonight.\nAmy (phone ringing, running down stairs from outside Penny\u2019s door): Hey, girl.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: Okay, next question, for the Butterfinger. How long is a galactic yea\nRaj: 250 million years.\nLeonard: Yes. (Cheers) \nHoward: Okay, this one is for a Cadbury Creme Egg.\nSheldon: Oh! It\u2019s not even Easter time. This is crazy.\nHoward: Which Archimedean solid has 20 regular triangular faces, 30 square faces, 12 pentagonal faces, 60 vertices and 120 edges?\nAll together: The Rhombicosidodecahedron. (Cheers) \nLeonard: We are so smart.\nRaj: Why didn\u2019t girls like us in high school?\nHoward: Because we were awkward and weird and couldn\u2019t play sports!\nLeonard: Right again. (Cheers)\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "9_21": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The comic book store. \nSheldon: I have a question about Batman. Batman is a man who dresses up like a bat. Man-bat is a part man, part bat hybrid. Now, if Man-Bat dressed up as a man to fight crime, would he be Man-Batman?\nLeonard: No, he\u2019d be Bat-Man-Bat.\nRaj: But wouldn\u2019t Man-Batman just be a Batman that was bitten by a radioactive man?\nHoward: But Batman is a man. You\u2019re talking about a man who would have the powers of a man. That\u2019s just Man-Man.\nSheldon: Well, isn\u2019t Man-Man just Man?\nLeonard: But what if Man-Man dressed as a bat?\nRaj: Well, that\u2019s just Batman.\nLeonard: No, if a man dresses as a bat, that\u2019s Batman, but if Man-Man dresses as a bat, that\u2019s Batman-Man.\nHoward: So does that answer your question?\nSheldon: Oh, I haven\u2019t asked it yet.\nRaj (checking text on phone): Oh, that\u2019s Claire. Got to run.\nLeonard: I thought you were back with Emily.\nRaj: Uh, actually I\u2019m seeing both of them.\nLeonard: You mean like through their window from behind a bush?\nRaj: No, I\u2019m actually dating two women. Later.\nLeonard: Really? The guy who for years couldn\u2019t even talk to women is suddenly going out with two of them? How is that possible?\nHoward: I know. Scientists have tried to reproduce it with computational models, but, in each case, the world blows up.\nLeonard: Seriously, that guy\u2019s dating two women?\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: What, why did you get a party sub?\nLeonard: People are coming over, it looked fun.\nSheldon: Well, we\u2019re only watching Game of Thrones. A party sub implies it\u2019s a party.\nLeonard: Your attendance implies it\u2019s not.\nSheldon: I like a party as much as the next man, as long as the next man doesn\u2019t like a party. Oh, by the way, don\u2019t forget, tomorrow is our quarterly roommate agreement meeting.\nLeonard: Oh, Sheldon, we don\u2019t need a meeting every three months.\nSheldon: Hmm? Well, it sounds like the kind of thing one would bring up at a quarterly roommate agreement meeting. Lucky for you it\u2019s tomorrow.\nLeonard: Oh, you know what? I\u2019m not going.\nSheldon: Well, you have to go. It\u2019s Penny\u2019s first time leading the Pledge of Allegiance.\nLeonard: This meeting is a waste of time. Whether we make the switch from Post Raisin Bran to Kellogg\u2019s Raisin Bran should not require parliamentary procedure.\nSheldon: You realize one of them has sugar on the raisins.\nLeonard: You\u2019re the only one who eats them.\nSheldon: And yet you get to weigh in. Democracy, it\u2019s pretty cool, isn\u2019t it?\nLeonard: I\u2019m not going, you can\u2019t make me.\nSheldon: Well, we\u2019ll just see about that.\nPenny: What is the problem?\nSheldon: He says he\u2019s not coming to the roommate agreement meeting tomorrow.\nPenny: Well, why the hell did I memorize the Pledge?\nLeonard: You have fun. I will not be attending.\nSheldon: Oh, fine. We don\u2019t have to have a roommate agreement meeting if you don\u2019t want to.\nLeonard: Thank you.\nSheldon: Of course, it will require a vote. Unfortunately, my official gavel is in my bedroom, but luckily, I have my travel gavel.\nLeonard: You\u2019re being ridiculous.\nSheldon: There\u2019s a motion on the floor, I\u2019m ridiculous. Do we have a second? Hmm? Hmm? There is no second. The motion is denied. Next time, make sure you have the votes first. That was embarrassing.\nLeonard: Can you please talk to him?\nPenny: Well, why are you fighting him on this?\nLeonard: Because I am tired of him always getting his way. We don\u2019t need a stupid meeting. We don\u2019t even need a roommate agreement, and I hope that sandwich does cause a party.\nPenny: Well, I will still come to your meeting.\nSheldon: Well, I should hope so. Tomorrow\u2019s picture day.\nLeonard: Why are you taking his side?\nPenny: Because it\u2019s important to him, and when we signed the roommate agreement, we made a deal.\nSheldon: You keep talking like that, you\u2019re gonna make colour guard.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s house.\nRaj: Man, I\u2019m worn out.\nHoward: I know. Imagine if we were actually moving.\nRaj: No, it\u2019s just, ever since I started dating Claire and Emily at the same time, it\u2019s exhausting.\nHoward: You\u2019re exhausted? Try folding every five pages in a pregnancy book so your wife thinks you read it.\nRaj: But, dude, you\u2019re so lucky. Getting to stay home at night with the woman you love.\nHoward: I guess I am lucky.\nRaj: You are, because dating two women, I mean, I can\u2019t even remember the last time I slept in my own apartment. I wake up and I\u2019m like, am I at Claire\u2019s or am I at Emily\u2019s? Is there a third girl I\u2019ve forgotten about? Like, where am I?\nBernadette: Hey, Raj.\nRaj: Hey, how\u2019s the mommy-to-be?\nBernadette: Good. A little tired.\nRaj: I feel you. I\u2019ve been dating multiple women.\nHoward: You sure you don\u2019t want to come watch Game of Thrones with us?\nBernadette: You guys have fun. I\u2019m just gonna snuggle up in bed with a book.\nRaj: Oh, that sounds great, a bed to yourself. Can\u2019t even remember what that\u2019s like.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Are you up-to-date on Game of Thrones?\nPenny: Mm, I think so. Dragons, snow zombies, and all the hot guys are dead.\nSheldon: Oh, I don\u2019t know. Theon Greyjoy looks pretty good for a guy who had his genitals cut off.\nPenny: Uh-oh, somebody\u2019s still pouting.\nLeonard: Leave me alone.\nPenny: If it\u2019s because you lost a stick, I know where it went.\nLeonard: Not funny.\nPenny: You know you\u2019re gonna make up with him. Can we just skip to that part?\nLeonard: Oh, of course, because I\u2019m the only adult around here.\nPenny: Really? The only adult?\nLeonard: Yeah, that\u2019s right.\nSheldon: Tonight I\u2019ll be watching a show rated M.A., and that stands for mature audiences, buster.\nPenny: All right, you would think the only adult wouldn\u2019t let something silly ruin our entire night.\nLeonard: And I\u2019d think you\u2019d understand why I\u2019m annoyed.\nSheldon: All this could be avoided if you\u2019d just come to the meeting.\nLeonard: I don\u2019t want to.\nSheldon: Oh, it\u2019s just a meeting. One simple meeting.\nLeonard: Stop saying meeting.\nSheldon: Meeting, meeting, bo-beeting, banana-fana, fo-feeting, fee-fi mo-meeting.\nAmy: I brought my famous spinach dip.\nSheldon: Yeah, Amy, just one second. Meeting.\nScene: Howard\u2019s car.\nHoward: I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m hoping for a boy or a girl. I mean, if it\u2019s a boy, I\u2019m gonna have to teach him to play catch. Which means I\u2019m gonna have to google how to play catch. If it\u2019s a girl, I mean, they\u2019re so innocent and you know how guys are.\nRaj: Totally, guys are the worst. I mean, look at me. I let Emily make me a frittata and I kept the leftovers in Claire\u2019s fridge that night. I\u2019m such a dog.\nHoward: There you go again.\nRaj: I\u2019m sorry, have I been complaining about it too much?\nHoward: Actually, what you\u2019re doing is pretending to complain, but really trying to brag.\nRaj: How could you say that?\nHoward: Oh, I wish could enjoy a cup of tea without a naked girl bouncing up and down on me.\nRaj: I never said that.\nHoward: Don\u2019t you hate it when you can\u2019t remember whose bra it is you found wedged in your couch?\nRaj: Okay, that I said. But that\u2019s a real problem. You give a girl another woman\u2019s bra, and you will not be having sex with her that night. Maybe the other girl, but not her.\nScene: The apartment.\nAmy: What\u2019s going on with him?\nPenny: Oh, he\u2019s all bent out of shape about having a roommate agreement meeting.\nSheldon: Apparently, perfect attendance isn\u2019t cool any more.\nPenny: Don\u2019t worry, he\u2019ll come around.\nAmy: Well, I get why he\u2019s annoyed.\nSheldon: Well, then you don\u2019t understand what\u2019s happening. See, Leonard refused to participate in a mandatory quarterly roommate agreement meeting. This is what a generation raised on Bart Simpson looks like.\nLeonard: You love The Simpsons.\nSheldon: I love Lisa Simpson.\nAmy: Well, I know how he feels. I never enjoyed our relationship agreement meetings.\nSheldon: Wait. You were pretending?\nAmy: Sorry.\nSheldon: No. I don\u2019t believe you. I could tell.\nAmy: Oh, Sheldon, I never thought re-filing a matter in a standing subcommittee could be so fascinating.\nSheldon: Hmm, what do you think?\nPenny: You don\u2019t know?\nScene: The stairwell.\nRaj: Hey, did I say something to upset you?\nHoward: No, I\u2019m fine.\nRaj: Really? Because usually we walk side by side, and I just went up two flights of stairs staring at your bottom.\nHoward: Just drop it.\nRaj: Okay, I think I see what\u2019s happening here. You\u2019re jealous of me.\nHoward: Oh, please. What could you possibly have that I would be jealous of?\nRaj: It\u2019s not what I have, it\u2019s how many people I\u2019m having it with.\nPenny: Come on, Sheldon, we\u2019ll watch Game of Thrones over here.\nSheldon: Gladly.\nLeonard: Oh, good, go. You know, it\u2019ll be nice to watch an episode without someone saying, I read the books, don\u2019t get too fond of this character.\nSheldon: It\u2019s not always because they die. In one case, it\u2019s because they\u2019ve become involved with underground tree people from the dawn of time. Yeah, but I won\u2019t say who it is. It\u2019s Brann.\nHoward: Wait, what is going on?\nPenny: Leonard\u2019s being a jerk, so we\u2019re gonna watch over here.\nAmy: Do you guys want to watch with us?\nHoward: As long as I don\u2019t have to watch with him.\nRaj: Fine, I don\u2019t want to watch with you either. I\u2019ll go over here.\nHoward: Why do you get to pick?\nRaj: Okay, then you go there.\nHoward: Don\u2019t tell me where to go.\nLeonard: Howard, just come in here.\nPenny: Yeah, come on, Raj.\nRaj: Wait, did Amy make her spinach dip?\nSheldon: She did.\nHoward: And I\u2019m gonna eat it all.\nScene: The apartment.\nHoward: So what the hell happened?\nLeonard: Oh, I just ran out of patience with Sheldon\u2019s nonsense.\nHoward: Tell me about it. I\u2019ve had it with Raj, too.\nAmy: You know, like women, men have a monthly hormone cycle. Dips in testosterone can cause irritability.\nHoward: Interesting. Maybe my male cycle synced up with Raj\u2019s actual period.\nLeonard: If Sheldon\u2019s testosterone dipped, he\u2019d become a butterfly. (Knock on door) Oh. Maybe someone\u2019s here to apologize.\nStuart: Hey, Leonard.\nLeonard: Stuart.\nStuart: Uh, is this not a dress-up party?\nLeonard: No.\nStuart: Was it ever a dress-up party?\nLeonard: No.\nStuart: Howard, didn\u2019t you tell me it was a dress-up party?\nHoward: Yeah.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment. Knock on door.\nStuart: I was told this is where to go if I\u2019m mad at Howard.\nPenny: May I take your cloak?\nStuart: Thanks. This thing kept getting caught in the chain of my bike.\nSheldon: Well, I\u2019ll catch you up. Uh, Penny is angry at Leonard, Leonard\u2019s angry at me and Penny, I\u2019m angry at Leonard and Amy, Raj is angry at Howard, and I\u2019m angry at George R.R. Martin \u2019cause there are no new books for me to spoil for Leonard.\nStuart: So what happened with you and Howard?\nRaj: Says I was talking too much about dating Claire and Emily, and I accused him of being jealous.\nStuart: I\u2019m jealous. Closest I\u2019ve come to dating two women was that time I dated one woman.\nScene: The apartment. \nLeonard: I don\u2019t know how you put up with it. He\u2019s impossible. I mean, holding a meeting to decide what breakfast cereal we should buy.\nHoward: Yeah. Cap\u2019n Crunch with Crunch Berries, move on.\nLeonard: Anyway, Amy, thank you for sticking up for me.\nAmy: Oh, I honestly couldn\u2019t care less.\nLeonard: Sorry?\nAmy: Well, I just took your side \u2019cause sometimes I get annoyed at how close Sheldon and Penny are.\nLeonard: Well, they argue all the time. They aren\u2019t that close.\nAmy: Who\u2019s always comforting him when he\u2019s upset?\nLeonard: Penny, but\u2026\nAmy: Who\u2019s the only one who can make him take his medicine when he\u2019s sick?\nLeonard: I try to hide it in his peanut butter, but he spits it out.\nAmy: Okay. And did you know she has him add things to the roommate agreement so she can get her way and not fight with you about it?\nLeonard: Son of a bitch. Why is that funny?\nHoward: I don\u2019t know. I like the pain of others.\nLeonard: Oh, well, then you\u2019ll enjoy this. Bernadette does the same thing with you and Koothrappali.\nHoward: No, she doesn\u2019t.\nLeonard: She defends him all the time.\nHoward: She does not.\nAmy: Who told you to stop making all those Gandhi jokes about him?\nHoward: Well, she did. And human resources.\nLeonard: Who do you think told Koothrappali to go to human resources?\nHoward: Son of a bitch.\nLeonard: You\u2019re, you\u2019re right, it feels good.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment.\nRaj: All right, it\u2019s almost game time. Get it? Game of Thrones, game time?\nStuart: Two women, huh?\nSheldon (at knock on door): Oh, perhaps it\u2019s Amy coming to her senses.\nPenny: What\u2019s up?\nLeonard: You know, you don\u2019t need to use Sheldon to get your way with me in a dumb roommate agreement.\nPenny: Where\u2019d you get that from?\nLeonard: From Amy.\nPenny: Ugh. Amy, why did you tell him that?\nAmy: Because you were defending Sheldon like you always do.\nPenny: I don\u2019t always defend Sheldon.\nLeonard: Oh, yes, you do. You know you have a weird brother-sister-Elliott-E.T. relationship with him.\nPenny: What about your weird relationship with him?\nLeonard: That\u2019s different. I\u2019m like the little girl in Poltergeist and he\u2019s the creepy thing in the TV.\nHoward: Um, guys? Were there any nuts in that food?\nLeonard: I don\u2019t think so. Why?\nHoward: Well just a feeling.\nScene: A hospital waiting room.\nLeonard: It just said Italian sub. I had no idea mortadella has pistachios in it.\nSheldon: Interesting fact, in Italian, the morta in mortadella means death.\nAmy: Sheldon.\nSheldon: I didn\u2019t say fun fact. I\u2019m not a monster.\nBernadette: He\u2019s gonna be okay.\nSheldon: Now it\u2019s a fun fact.\nStuart: Boy, stuff like this really puts things in perspective.\nBernadette: Why are you dressed like that?\nStuart: Oh, uh, Howard thought it\u2019d be funny to tell me it was a costume party.\nBernadette: That wasn\u2019t nice.\nStuart: No, but he almost died, so we\u2019re cool.\nRaj: You know, if you think about it, tonight was kind of like a real-life Game of Thrones.\nAmy: How?\nRaj: Well, Howard eating that pistachio was like when King Joffrey got poisoned.\nPenny: Okay, well, that was murder, this was an accident.\nRaj: Okay. But you using Sheldon to do your dirty work is like when Cersei used the King\u2019s Guard to do her bidding.\nSheldon: Cersei uses her body to manipulate men. Penny just takes me to The LEGO Store.\nRaj: Okay. Oh, how about this? Stuart\u2019s dressed like a brother of the Night\u2019s Watch, and they don\u2019t have sex.\nPenny: There you go.\nLeonard: That\u2019s true.\nSheldon: Fair enough.\nHoward: Hey.\nLeonard: Hey.\nBernadette: You all right?\nHoward: I\u2019m fine. Just a little embarrassed I had to be carried down the stairs like a baby. Thanks.\nLeonard: Let\u2019s get out of here.\nAmy: That was scary.\nSheldon: Well, the important thing is I said that big sandwich would ruin everything, and I was right.\nScene: The street. \nRaj (shouting from upstairs window): Hey, Jon Snow. How come your horse has a basket on it?\nStuart: How come your head has your face on it?\nSheldon: They don\u2019t wear bicycle helmets in Game of Thrones. You\u2019re thematically inaccurate, but I applaud your commitment to safety.\nStuart: Don\u2019t you guys have anything better to do?\nLeonard: Better than watching a guy in a fur cloak ride a girl\u2019s bike? Nope.\nStuart: That\u2019s it, you just lost bathroom privileges at the comic book store. Horse has a basket on it. Stupid\u2026 aaargh!\nScene: Leonard\u2019s bedroom.\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard. (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard. (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard.\nLeonard: What?\nSheldon: I never got to ask my question about Batman.\nLeonard: What is it?\nSheldon: If Batman were bitten by a radioactive Man-Bat, and then fought crime disguised as Man-Bat, would he be Man-Bat-Man-Bat-Man or simply Man-Bat-Man-Bat-Batman?\nPenny: Is he still wearing the Batman suit under the Man-Bat suit?\nSheldon: I\u2019ll be back.\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "4_10": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The apartment. \nSheldon: Clarify something for me. Isn\u2019t the point of a communal meal the exchange of ideas and opinions? An opportunity to consider important issues of the day?\nLeonard: It is. You just kind of put a damper on things when you said, the next person I see talking with food in their mouth will be put to death.\nSheldon: Well, we could argue about who said what all night long, but to set things back on course, I will propose a new topic of conversation.\nLeonard: Great.\nSheldon: What is the best number? By the way, there\u2019s only one correct answer.\nRaj: Five million, three hundred eighteen thousand and eight?\nSheldon: Wrong. The best number is 73. You\u2019re probably wondering why.\nLeonard: No.\nHoward: Uh-uh.\nRaj: We\u2019re good.\nSheldon: 73 is the 21st prime number. Its mirror, 37, is the 12th, and its mirror, 21, is the product of multiplying, hang on to your hats, seven and three. Eh? Eh? Did I lie?\nLeonard: We get it. 73 is the Chuck Norris of numbers.\nSheldon: Chuck Norris wishes. In binary, 73 is a palindrome, one-zero-zero-one-zero-zero-one which backwards is one-zero-zero-one-zero-zero-one, exactly the same. All Chuck Norris backwards gets you is Sirron Kcuhc.\nRaj: Just for the record, when you enter five million three hundred eighteen thousand and eight in a calculator, upside-down it spells boobies.\nLeonard: Remember when you were wondering why the girls didn\u2019t want to eat with us tonight?\nHoward: Yeah, I get it now.\nScene: A bar.\nPenny: I love your little heart locket, Bernadette.\nBernadette: Oh, thanks. Howard gave it to me. It\u2019s the cutest thing. Every time I have dinner with his mom, the next day I get jewellery.\nAmy: Did you know that the iconic Valentine\u2019s heart shape is not actually based on the shape of a human heart, but rather on the shape of the buttocks of a female bending over?\nPenny: Oh, so I spent seventh grade dotting my I\u2019s with little asses? Cool.\nZack: Hey, Penny, how\u2019s it going?\nPenny: Hey, Zack, what are you doing here?\nZack: My dad\u2019s company prints the menus for this place. I\u2019m just dropping off some new ones laminated. Makes \u2019em easier to clean if people throw up on \u2019em. Guess how I got the idea?\nPenny: Yeah, I got it, I got it. Uh, Zack, these are my friends Bernadette and Amy.\nBernadette: Hi.\nZack: Hey.\nAmy: Hoo.\nZack: Okay, well, it was good to see you.\nPenny: Yeah, you, too.\nBernadette: He\u2019s really cute. How do you know him?\nPenny: Oh, we went out a couple of times.\nAmy: I\u2019m often flummoxed by current slang. Does went out mean had intercourse?\nBernadette: Yes.\nPenny: No, no. But in this case, yes.\nAmy: Interesting. And was it not satisfactory?\nPenny: No, it was great. He just didn\u2019t really challenge me on an intellectual level.\nBernadette: Couldn\u2019t you just fool around with him and then listen to NPR?\nPenny: Wouldn\u2019t help. Zack can\u2019t even spell NPR.\nBernadette: It\u2019s what I do with Howard. I\u2019m much smarter than he is. But it\u2019s important to protect his manhood.\nAmy: Hoo.\nBernadette: What\u2019s the matter?\nAmy: I\u2019m suddenly feeling flushed. My heart rate is elevated, my palms are clammy, my mouth is dry. In addition, I keep involuntarily saying hoo.\nPenny: Oh, we know what\u2019s causing that, don\u2019t we?\nAmy: It\u2019s no mystery. I obviously have the flu coupled with sudden-onset Tourette\u2019s syndrome.\nCredits sequence. \n \nScene: The university cafeteria.\nHoward: Did you hear about the accident at the bio lab?\nLeonard: No. What happened?\nHoward: They were injecting rats with radioactive isotopes and one of the techs got bit.\nRaj: Did he get superpowers?\nHoward: No, he got five stitches and a tetanus shot.\nRaj: Oh. Well, that\u2019s disappointing.\nHoward: Why?\nRaj: Well, you get bit by a radioactive animal in a lab, you kind of want to turn into a superhero.\nHoward: Yeah, but who\u2019d want to become Rat-Man?\nRaj: Who wouldn\u2019t? You could zip through a maze in nothing flat, squeeze through really small holes, and shut down restaurants in a single bound. And the best part is, if I were Rat-Man, you could be my sidekick, Mouse Boy.\nHoward: Mouse Boy?\nRaj: You don\u2019t like Mouse Boy? How about, uh, uh, Kid Vermin?\nHoward: First of all, if we had superpowers, I wouldn\u2019t be the sidekick. You\u2019d be the sidekick.\nRaj: Rat-Man is nobody\u2019s sidekick.\nHoward: Leonard, settle this. Of the two of us, who\u2019s the obvious sidekick?\nRaj: Yeah, Leonard, who?\nLeonard: 12 years after high school, and I\u2019m still at the nerd table.\nScene: Amy\u2019s lab. \nSheldon: Aren\u2019t you slicing that man\u2019s brain a little too thin?\nAmy: It\u2019s too thin if I were making a foot-long brain sandwich at Quiznos. For examination under a two-photon microscope, it\u2019s fine.\nSheldon: Well, you\u2019re the expert. If the correct way to do it is the wrong way, then I yield.\nAmy: Very well. If you die and donate your body to science, I promise to slice your brain like Canadian bacon.\nSheldon: Thank you.\nAmy: Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I have to take my temperature.\nSheldon: Are you monitoring your circadian rhythms in order to identify your periods of maximum mental acuity? I did that one summer. Ah, youth.\nAmy: No, I experienced some distressing symptoms last night, so I\u2019m checking my vital signs every hour.\nSheldon: I\u2019d be happy to create a chart and participate in a differential diagnosis.\nAmy: Oh, that sounds like fun.\nSheldon: All right. What were the symptoms?\nAmy: Elevated heart rate, moist palms, dry mouth and localized vascular throbbing.\nSheldon: Localized to what region?\nAmy: Ears and genitalia.\nSheldon: Interesting. Not body parts that usually team up. What about environmental factors? Describe the scene for me.\nAmy: I was sitting in a restaurant with Penny and Bernadette, drinking water, carbonated as it was a special occasion. Penny\u2019s friend Zack stopped by and said hello and I said hoo.\nSheldon: Who?\nAmy: Zack.\nSheldon: Then why did you ask?\nAmy: Ask what?\nSheldon: Who.\nAmy: Zack.\nSheldon: All right, let\u2019s start over. What did you say when Zack walked in?\nAmy: Hoo.\nSheldon: Zack.\nAmy: Why do you keep saying Zack?\nSheldon: Because you keep saying who.\nAmy: I\u2019m not saying hoo now. I said hoo last night.\nSheldon: And the answer was Zack, correct?\nAmy: There was no question. I simply said hoo.\nSheldon: All right, I think I have enough to go on. Possible explanations for your symptoms are, in descending order of likelihood, hyperthyroidism, premature menopause, hosting an alien parasite or, and I only include it for the sake of covering absolutely all bases, sexual arousal.\nAmy: Where would I have picked up an alien parasite?\nScene: The cafeteria. \n \nHoward: There you are.\nRaj: Oh, hey.\nHoward: Let me ask you a question. What are you most afraid of?\nRaj: I don\u2019t know. Um, nuclear war. Accidentally being buried alive. Any of those movies where you get that phone call that says you\u2019re going to die, and then you do.\nHoward: No. Something very specific that we both know you, Rajesh Koothrappali, are terrified of.\nRaj: Well, type two diabetes runs in my family. The thought of losing a toe\u2026\nHoward: Spiders! You\u2019re afraid of spiders!\nRaj: What the heck is this?\nHoward: A jar with a big spider in it, of course. Bravery test. First one to take his hand out is the sidekick.\nRaj: Are you crazy?\nHoward: Perhaps. Are you scared?\nRaj: No. But it\u2019s a stupid test.\nHoward: Oh, really? What if the earth was in danger and the only way to save it was to stick your hand in a jar with a spider?\nRaj: Oh, yeah? What if the earth was in danger and the only way to save it was to take a shower in the locker room and let other guys see you naked?\nHoward: Oh, come on. That\u2019s never gonna happen. Now put your hand in the jar or forever be revealed as my sidekick.\nRaj: All right, I will.\nHoward: How did you get so brave all of a sudden?\nRaj: It\u2019s easy. The spider\u2019s crawling up your arm.\nHoward: Get it off! Get it off! Please, Raj! Ah! Ah! Ah! Please. Oh!\nScene: Amy\u2019s lab. \nAmy: My blood work shows thyroid function normal. Cortisol levels normal.\nSheldon: How about your follicle-stimulating hormone levels?\nAmy: Sheldon, I am not going through menopause.\nSheldon: Are you sure? You said that with the testy bark of an old biddy.\nAmy: I think we need to face the cold, hard truth, I was sexually aroused by Penny\u2019s friend Zack.\nSheldon: Hang on. I don\u2019t know that we\u2019ve given the alien parasite hypothesis a fair shake.\nAmy: Let\u2019s look at this logically. I have a stomach, I get hungry. I have genitals, I have the potential for sexual arousal.\nSheldon: A cross we all must bear. You know, in difficult moments like this, I often turn to a force greater than myself.\nAmy: Religion?\nSheldon: Star Trek. Did you see Star Trek: The Motion Picture?\nAmy: No.\nSheldon: Don\u2019t. It\u2019s terrible. However, in it, we learn that when Spock finds himself drawn off the path of logic by feelings bubbling up from his human half, he suppresses them using the Vulcan mental discipline of Kolinar.\nAmy: Are you suggesting we live our lives guided by the philosophies found in cheap science fiction?\nSheldon: Cheap science fiction?\nAmy: What are you doing?\nSheldon: Using Kolinar to suppress my anger at that last comment.\nAmy: Is it possible that your concern for me at this moment is motivated by nothing more than simple jealousy?\nSheldon: I hadn\u2019t considered that. Give me a moment. All right, I\u2019ve considered it.\nAmy: And?\nSheldon: I reject it.\nAmy: You reject it because you don\u2019t feel jealousy, or because you are suppressing jealousy?\nSheldon: I think I\u2019ll eat my lunch at home.\nAmy: That\u2019s not your lunch, Sheldon, those are the cadaver brain specimens.\nSheldon: Oh. As they were incorrectly sliced, you can see how I could mistake them for my sashimi.\nScene: The laundry room.\nSheldon: Hello.\nPenny: Hey. Isn\u2019t tomorrow your usual laundry night?\nSheldon: The supermarket was out of my regular fabric softener. If this one under or over-softens, I\u2019ll need time to make things right.\nPenny: That\u2019s thinking ahead.\nSheldon: The alternative would be to think backwards. And that\u2019s just remembering.\nPenny: So how\u2019s Amy?\nSheldon: Amy\u2019s changed. I might have to let her go.\nPenny: Oh, no. Why?\nSheldon: I thought she was a highly evolved creature of pure intellect, like me. But recent events indicate that she may be a slave to her baser urges. Like you.\nPenny: Just going to skip over that insult.\nSheldon: What insult?\nPenny: Yeah. That\u2019s why I\u2019m going to skip over it. Are you saying that Amy is, oh, what\u2019s the\nscientific word?\nSheldon: Forget science. She\u2019s horny.\nPenny: Oh! Okay. Wow.\nSheldon: It\u2019s simple biology. There\u2019s nothing I can do about it.\nPenny: Are you sure?\nSheldon: What are you suggesting?\nPenny: I\u2019m suggesting there might be something you could do about Amy\u2019s urges?\nSheldon: It\u2019s illegal to spay a human being.\nPenny: Yeah. That\u2019s not what I had in mind.\nSheldon: Oh. Oh! You mean something I could do.\nPenny: Exactly.\nSheldon: Well, I was hoping to avoid this. But I might as well get it over with. Thank you, Penny. I\u2019ll let you know what happens.\nPenny: Oh, Amy, you lucky girl.\nScene: The apartment. Sheldon is on the phone.\nSheldon: Yes. This is Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Is this the Zack Johnson who used to have coitus with my neighbour Penny? Sorry to bother you. Hello. I\u2019m looking for a Zack Johnson who used to have coitus with my neighbour Penny. Coitus. It means intercourse. And I have a feeling I\u2019m speaking to the right Zack. This is Sheldon Cooper. Fine. Shelly. Yes, that does sound like a girl\u2019s name. No, it doesn\u2019t bother me. Yes, Smelly Shelly does bother me. Let me tell you why I\u2019m calling. I\u2019d like to know if you\u2019d be interested in having sex with Amy Farrah Fowler. Amy Farrah Fowler. Yes, that is a girl\u2019s name. Good grief. It\u2019s like trying to talk to a dolphin.\nScene: A gymnasium. \nLeonard: Really? This is going to decide who\u2019s the hero and who\u2019s the sidekick?\nHoward: You got a better idea?\nLeonard: Every idea is better than this idea.\nHoward: Ding!\nRaj: Wait. What the hell is ding?\nHoward: It\u2019s a bell.\nRaj: I don\u2019t think this kind of wrestling has a bell.\nHoward: Fine. How do you want to start?\nRaj: I say, uh, how about one, two, three, go?\nHoward: One-two-three-go? That\u2019s for babies.\nRaj: Okay, how about, uh, on your mark, get set, go?\nHoward: That\u2019s for a footrace. If you want to race, we have to go outside.\nRaj: No, it\u2019s chilly outside. Didn\u2019t bring my jacket.\nHoward: Oh, for crying out loud. What kind of superhero needs a jacket?\nRaj: What kind of superhero says dibs on the red tights, dibs on the red tights.\nHoward: All right, how about this? Ready, wrestle.\nRaj: Wait. Are we starting now? Or is that what you\u2019re going to say when we do start, or\u2026\nHoward: We\u2019re starting now!\nRaj: Don\u2019t yell at me!\nLeonard: Suppose there are worse ways to spend a Friday night. None come to mind.\nScene: A bar.\nSheldon: Look at this stamp. On what authority are they permitted to mutilate patrons as they enter?\nAmy: I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll wash off.\nSheldon: Little comfort tonight. I look like a Hell\u2019s Angel.\nAmy: There\u2019s Zack.\nSheldon: Are you sure this is what you want to do?\nAmy: It\u2019s not what I want to do, it\u2019s what I have to do.\nSheldon: Go, Amy Farrah Fowler. Follow your endocrine system.\nAmy: Thank you, Sheldon. You\u2019re a good friend.\nSheldon: Please don\u2019t drag this out. This is never going to come off.\nAmy: Excuse me? Zack? I am Amy Farrah Fowler. We met the other night. I have spent my life in pursuit of pure knowledge. Until I met you, my decisions were founded in logic and reason. And yet here I stand before you, 130 pounds of raging estrogen, longing to grab hold of your gluteus maximus and make Shakespeare\u2019s metaphorical beast with two backs.\nZack: My gluteus what?\nAmy: On the other hand, as I look at the blank, ape-like expression on your face, I have decided to adopt the Vulcan practice of Kolinar. Good-bye, Zack.\nZack: Bye. Hoo. That should hold me for a while.\nScene: The gymnasium.\nHoward: I\u2019m legally obligated to inform you that I took a karate lesson when I was 11. I\u2019d be a regular ninja by now if my mom could\u2019ve arranged a carpool.\nRaj: Oh, yeah? Well, I\u2019ve been taking Pilates class at the rec center, and my abs look like sections of a Hershey bar.\nHoward: Oh, yeah? Won\u2019t matter, you\u2019re going down!\nRaj: No, uh-uh, you\u2019re going down!\nHoward: If anybody\u2019s going to go down, it\u2019s going to be you.\nLeonard: Fellas. It\u2019s been 30 minutes. Nobody\u2019s touched each other.\nScene: A street. \nSheldon: I\u2019m glad you decided to reject your animal hindbrain and return to the realm of pure intellect.\nAmy: As am I. (Holds Sheldon\u2019s hand)\nSheldon: What are you doing?\nAmy: An experiment. Nope. Nothing. Never mind.\nScene: The gymnasium. \nRaj: You realize you can\u2019t win.\nHoward: I prefer to think that I can\u2019t lose.\nRaj: You\u2019re wrong. It\u2019s only a matter of time before you fall into Rat-Man\u2019s rat trap.\nHoward: You pathetic fool! If there were a rat-catcher, wouldn\u2019t it catch Rat-Man?\nRaj: Just because I didn\u2019t express myself well doesn\u2019t mean my underlying point was invalid! You bloviating buffoon!\nHoward: You narcissistic nincompoop!\nRaj: You crimson coward! Oh, Leonard, wake up, you\u2019re missing some very excellent superhero quips.\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "6_17": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: (After a \u201cpreviously on\u201d sequence) A coffee shop\nRaj: So then I went to Cambridge, which was wonderful not only because it\u2019s a good school but because it totally looks like Hogwarts. That\u2019s where I fell in love with astronomy, and now I\u2019m an astrophysicist at Caltech, so I guess you could say, uh, Raj is my name and stars are my game. And rhyming is also my game. So, uh, two games. Uh, anyway, that, that\u2019s enough about me. I want to hear everything about you.\nGirl: I have to go to the bathroom.\nRaj: I go to the bathroom, too. Sometimes more frequently than I care to admit. Oh, I\u2019ve had it checked out, it\u2019s nothing. Hmm. This is going great. Mmm, can I have a refill on my chai tea? Yes, I have a good feeling about this. (Girl can be seen sneaking past window and leaving) I should have bought condoms.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Hello, I\u2019m Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Welcome to Sheldon Cooper Presents Fun with Flags. My apologies that this episode is coming late. I did shoot one last week, in honour of Black History Month, but I was informed by my roommate that my spot-on portrayal of George Washington Carver could be considered wildly racist. My heart goes out to the members of the African-American community, who, like me, have been kept down by The Man. Now, Fun with Flags is not just for the flag aficionado, it\u2019s also for the flag novice, so, to help me with that, please welcome my friend, neighbour, and flag virgin, yeah, not a real virgin. She\u2019s had coitus many times. Sometimes within earshot of this flag enthusiast. Once while he was trying to watch The Incredibles. Penny.\nPenny: Hello.\nSheldon: So, Penny, I understand you would like to learn more about flags.\nPenny: Yeah, I can\u2019t tell you how many times I\u2019ve been at a party where everyone\u2019s talking about flags and I just couldn\u2019t join in.\nSheldon: Yeah. Well, you came to the right place.\nPenny: Uh, I\u2019m sorry, can we just pause for a minute?\nSheldon: What\u2019s wrong?\nPenny: I just think it might look more natural if you talked to me instead of the camera, you know, like, like a real conversation. It\u2019s something we work on in my acting class.\nSheldon: Interesting. A few people in the comments section have said that my delivery is robotic. Perhaps that isn\u2019t the compliment it sounds like.\nPenny: Yeah, let\u2019s try it again, and maybe, this time, you could work on your body language a bit. You know, when you\u2019re all hunched like that, you\u2019re shutting the audience out, but when you\u2019re relaxed and open, you\u2019re inviting them in.\nSheldon: Right. And which one do I want?\nPenny: Let\u2019s try open.\nSheldon: If our friend, the flag, has taught me anything, it\u2019s to go where the wind takes you. As long as you remain firmly attached to a rigid pole. And, action. So, Penny, what sort of flag questions keep you awake at night?\nPenny: Um, well, I\u2019m from Nebraska. So what can you tell me about the state flag?\nSheldon: Gosh, Penny, what\u2019d you have for breakfast? A big glass of good question juice? The Nebraska state flag is simply the state seal on a field of blue. Spread your legs, invite them in.\nScene: Outside Raj\u2019s apartment.\nHoward: I\u2019m telling you, something\u2019s wrong. I can always feel it when Raj is in trouble.\nBernadette: Geez, how close were you guys before we got married?\nLeonard: Don\u2019t look under that rock. (Knocking) Raj, you okay?\nHoward: You in there?\nRaj (off): Go away!\nLeonard: Come on, buddy, open up.\nHoward: We\u2019re worried about you.\nRaj (off): Oh, just because I\u2019ve stopped going to work and answering my phone you think something bad happened? Maybe something good happened.\nBernadette: Did something good happen?\nRaj (off): Of course not. Nothing good ever happens. (Opens door. He is wearing a stained vest, his hair is unkempt, and he is drinking wine from a bottle.)\nLeonard: Whoa.\nRaj: What?\nLeonard: Nope, just, just, whoa.\nBernadette: It smells pretty ripe in here. You kind feel it in your eyes.\nLeonard: Raj, what\u2019s going on?\nRaj: I was humiliated by yet another woman.\nHoward: You didn\u2019t kill her and chop her up, that\u2019s not what we\u2019re smelling, right?\nRaj: No. I took her for coffee, and she snuck out the bathroom window to get away from me.\nBernadette: Oh, you poor baby.\nRaj: I went and looked. It was a high and tiny window. She must have been very motivated.\nHoward: I\u2019m sorry. That\u2019s awful, but come on, you got to shake it off.\nLeonard: Yeah, you can\u2019t stay in your apartment for the rest of your life.\nRaj: Why not? With online shopping and overnight delivery, I can get anything I want. Look, I just ordered a case of Dinty Moore beef stew and two live lobsters on Amazon.\nLeonard: Lobsters overnight?\nHoward: Oh, you\u2019re kidding. Let me see. Well, I\u2019ll be. Look, you can throw in a couple steaks and have a surf and turf.\nLeonard: The surf and turf sounds good. See if they have corn on the cob.\nBernadette: Guys, we\u2019re trying to get him out of here, not you in.\nRaj: You\u2019re wasting your time. Just please, leave me alone.\nHoward: Now what?\nLeonard: I don\u2019t know.\nBernadette: We could go to Red Lobster and talk about it. We\u2019re all thinking it. I just had the decency to wait for him to leave.\nScene: The apartment.\nAmy (on webcam): Hello, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Hello. How\u2019s the final stage of your nicotine addiction study going?\nAmy: Fine. Just hold on. Mommy\u2019s on the phone! Sorry. We\u2019ve cut the monkeys down to one cigarette a day, so things are a little intense. Makes me miss my marijuana-abusing flatworms. Those guys were mellow.\nSheldon: Good news. Uh, the latest episode of Fun with Flags is online.\nAmy: Oh, that\u2019s right. How\u2019d it go with Penny?\nSheldon: Much better than I expected. She even gave me some helpful tips about acting and body language. Watch. Welcome to my world. Not welcome to my world. Welcome. Not welcome.\nAmy: Subtle, but powerful.\nSheldon: I know. I\u2019m still learning to control it.\nAmy: Did you tell Penny how helpful she was?\nSheldon: Why would I do that?\nAmy: Because she\u2019s your friend, and she did a nice job. I\u2019m sure she\u2019d like to hear it.\nSheldon: All right.\nAmy: I didn\u2019t mean now. Hello? Yeah, yeah, you want a cigarette. Well, I\u2019d like a normal boyfriend. Deal with it.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment.\nPenny: Oh, hi. What\u2019s up?\nSheldon: Um\u2026\nPenny: You need me to shut the door so you can do your knocking thing?\nSheldon: No. I didn\u2019t start yet, it\u2019s fine.\nPenny: Okay. So, what do you need?\nSheldon: Well, I was thinking about you helping me out last night (knock, knock, knock) Penny. And I just wanted to tell you (knock, knock, knock) Penny, that the answer to the question, who did a great job? is you, (knock, knock, knock) Penny.\nPenny: Really?\nSheldon: Yes, you were very natural in front of the camera, and I found your suggestions extremely helpful.\nPenny: Aw, sweetie, you just made my day.\nSheldon: Okay.\nPenny: Hey, my acting class is putting on a play Friday night. I could put you and Amy on the guest list.\nSheldon: Oh, that sounds terrible. Why would I want to do that?\nScene: The apartment.\nAmy (on webcam): That\u2019s right. They\u2019re no good without the lighter.\nSheldon: Well, so much for your advice on complimenting Penny.\nAmy: Why? What happened?\nSheldon: She tried to rope us into going to her acting class to see a play. Don\u2019t worry. Luckily, I had the good sense to drown that kitten in the river.\nAmy: Sheldon, that\u2019s very rude. She helped you with your show. The right thing to do is reciprocate by going to see her play.\nSheldon: Oh, so many crazy rules.\nAmy: That better be Tootsie Rolls you\u2019re throwing at me!\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment.\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. Oh yeah, much better.\nPenny: What?\nSheldon: Amy pointed out to me that since you did something nice for me, I\u2019m obligated to do something nice for you. So, yes, I\u2019ll go to your dopey play.\nPenny: Hey, I don\u2019t want you to go any more.\nSheldon: Why not?\nPenny: You should go \u2019cause you want to go, not because you have to.\nSheldon: Oh, Dear Lord, more rules? Where does it stop? Can I want to go because I have to want to go?\nPenny: Okay. Do whatever you want.\nSheldon: Yeah, but now, wait. Do whatever I want? Or whatever I have to want?\nPenny: Oh, for God\u2019s sake, just come to the play.\nSheldon: All right. I don\u2019t want to, but at least that makes sense.\nScene: The comic book store.\nSheldon: You know, I haven\u2019t seen Raj in several days. Is he no longer a part of our social group? And if so, should we be interviewing for a replacement? Perhaps, this time, we go Latin.\nHoward: He\u2019s just decided he\u2019s never leaving his apartment again.\nSheldon: Oh, brilliant. I\u2019ve been itching to pull that trigger.\nHoward: He\u2019s upset because he can\u2019t get anywhere with women.\nSheldon: Would it help if I gave him some pointers? I\u2019m just funnin\u2019 ya.\nGirl: Hi. I don\u2019t know if you remember me, but I was here the other night at your party.\nStuart: Oh, yeah, you left with Raj.\nGirl: Uh, yeah.\nHoward: You\u2019re the one? Okay, let me tell you something. That guy you blew off happens to be my best friend. Okay? He was devastated.\nGirl: Sorry. Can you just give him this?\nHoward: Okay. But I gotta warn you, Raj is a proud, passionate man. If you go running out on him again, you\u2019re only gonna get, like, three or four more chances before you are history.\nScene: Raj\u2019s apartment.\nHoward: Come on, she came back. This is good news. You should celebrate.\nRaj: I don\u2019t want to celebrate.\nHoward: Not even a little? I mean, we could have a pants party. Go put some on.\nRaj: Why would I want her number? I don\u2019t want anything to do with this woman.\nHoward: Oh, come on, Raj.\nRaj: No, you don\u2019t get it. I want nothing to do with any woman. My heart is stone. From now on, I\u2019m a monk. I renounce all worldly pleasures. Except for lobster. And garlic butter.\nHoward: Boy, I want to tell you it\u2019s her loss, but you are not making it easy.\nRaj: You\u2019re, you\u2019re a good friend for trying to help, but, I\u2019ve made my choice.\nHoward: All right. Well, I\u2019ll see you around.\nRaj: See you. No, wait, take her number. I don\u2019t want the temptation.\nHoward: Okay.\nRaj: I must be strong so I don\u2019t stray from my true purpose, the study of the universe.\nHoward: All right. Thanks for ruining lobster for me.\nScene: Outside on the street.\nRaj: Wait! Give me the number! Give me the number! Give me the number!\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: So, Amy, what\u2019s going on with your addiction study?\nAmy: Sadly, I\u2019m no longer associated with that project.\nLeonard: Why? What happened?\nAmy: Typical bureaucratic nonsense. You can get animals addicted to a harmful substance, you can dissect their brains, but you throw their own faeces back at them and suddenly you\u2019re unprofessional.\nLeonard: I\u2019m sorry. That I asked.\nSheldon: All right, let\u2019s get this stupid play over with.\nLeonard: Uh, hang on. Empty your pockets.\nSheldon: Why?\nLeonard: You know why. The Nintendo DS. And the PSP. Now the Gameboy.\nSheldon: Aw, for Pete\u2019s sake. Can we go now?\nLeonard: Well, is that all of it? (Pulls a Rubik\u2019s cube from his pants.) Just set it down.\nAmy: Just so you know, this is not a stupid play. A Streetcar Named Desire is an American classic.\nSheldon: It\u2019s about streetcars? Oh, great. I won\u2019t need this. (Pulls out an etch-a-sketch.)\nScene: Outside Raj\u2019s apartment. The girl from the comic book store knocks on the door.\nRaj: Just a sec. Oh, who says just a sec? I hate myself. Hello.\nGirl: Hi.\nRaj: Uh, would you like to come in?\nGirl: Oh, no, I can\u2019t stay.\nRaj: Oh.\nGirl: I just wanted to say, I\u2019m sorry for running out of the coffee shop. That wasn\u2019t cool. So, uh, yeah. I\u2019m sorry.\nRaj: Wait. Can you at least tell me what went wrong? It\u2019s okay. I can take anything. Unless it\u2019s something I did, or said, or am. \u2018Cause those are, like, my buttons.\nGirl: No, it\u2019s not any of that. It\u2019s just, I kind of have a hard time around people I don\u2019t know.\nRaj: Really? Then what were you doing at the comic book store that night?\nGirl: I\u2019ve been trying to force myself into situations that I\u2019m not comfortable with. I saw the flyer in the store window, and I made myself go in. I don\u2019t even like comic books.\nRaj: Yeah, me neither.\nGirl: Then what were you doing there?\nRaj: I lied. I love them. I only said that so you\u2019d go out with me.\nGirl: Oh, you don\u2019t want to do that. I\u2019m kind of broken.\nRaj: That\u2019s great. I\u2019m broken, too.\nGirl: Oh, no, you\u2019re not.\nRaj: Oh, I totally am. If it wasn\u2019t for this beer, I couldn\u2019t even talk to you right now. I\u2019m a wreck. There are many things seriously wrong with me. And not quirks, either. Like, diagnosable psychological problems. Maybe brain damage.\nGirl: Well, how do I know you\u2019re not just saying that?\nRaj: Go out with me on one date, and I promise you, you\u2019ll see.\nGirl: Okay. Text me. Bye.\nRaj: You won\u2019t regret it. I\u2019m the most pathetic guy you\u2019ve ever met. And that, boys and girls, is how it\u2019s done.\nScene: The theatre.\nPenny (as Blanche DuBois) : You love her very much, don\u2019t you?\nActor (as Mitch): Yes.\nPenny: I think you have a great capacity for devotion. You\u2019ll be lonely when she passes on, won\u2019t you? I understand what that is.\nActor: To be lonely?\nLeonard: She\u2019s pretty good, huh?\nSheldon: She is. But when do they get to the part about streetcars?\nPenny (as Blanche): \u2026when I was a very young girl. When I was 16 years old, I made the discovery, love. All at once, and much, much too completely. It was like you suddenly turned a blinding light on something that had always been half a shadow. That\u2019s how it struck the world for me. But I was unlucky. Deluded.\nSheldon: She\u2019s remarkable.\nLeonard: She really is.\nAmy: Our Penny\u2019s a star.\nSheldon: How can she remember all those lines, but as a waitress, she can\u2019t remember no tomato on my hamburger?\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "5_5": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The comic book store.\nLeonard: It\u2019s from Game of Thrones. What do you think?\nSheldon: I don\u2019t know. If we\u2019re going to start a fantasy sword collection, and I\u2019ve long thought we should, is this really the sword to start with?\nLeonard: What did you have in mind?\nSheldon: Well, off the top of my head, I\u2019d have to go with Excalibur. It gives you the right to rule England.\nLeonard: It would be a replica of a movie prop.\nSheldon: Fair enough. It\u2019d give you the right to rule a replica of England.\nLeonard: Well, they don\u2019t have an Excalibur here, so what do you want to do?\nSheldon: Mm. Tough decision. There\u2019s no weaponry from Lord of the Rings, forged in a Chinese sweatshop?\nLeonard: Just Bilbo Baggins\u2019 sword over there.\nSheldon: Two grown men with a hobbit\u2019s dagger; wouldn\u2019t we look silly? Okay, let\u2019s go for it.\nStuart: Oh, I see you guys have found my little treasure.\nLeonard: Yeah. It\u2019s okay, I guess.\nSheldon: Okay? It\u2019s magnificent.\nLeonard: Buh-buh-buh-buh! What do you want for it?\nStuart: Oh, it\u2019s hard to put a price on something that\u2019s a copy of something that was on pay cable. But for my friends, let\u2019s say 250?\nLeonard: Oh, that\u2019s pretty steep.\nStuart: Well, it\u2019s a limited edition. They only made 8,000 of these bad boys.\nSheldon: Only 8,000? We\u2019re wasting precious time. Buy it.\nLeonard: Hang on. Can you do any better?\nStuart: Are you kidding? I\u2019m already giving you the friends and family discount.\nSheldon: Oh, did you hear that? We\u2019re getting the friends and family discount. We are honoured and we will take it.\nLeonard: Slow down. Two hundred.\nSheldon: What are you doing? Two fifty is already the discounted price.\nLeonard: Will you shut up?\nStuart: Tell you what, I\u2019ll go two thirty-five.\nLeonard: Nope. Maybe another time.\nStuart: Okay, two twenty five, my final offer.\nSheldon: Take it, take it.\nLeonard: Two hundred.\nStuart: Man, you\u2019re killing me!\nSheldon: Killing you? I can\u2019t breathe.\nStuart: Two ten, and I\u2019m losing money.\nSheldon: Oh, now, we can\u2019t let him lose money, Leonard. I\u2019m so sorry.\nLeonard: Two ten and you throw in the Iron Man helmet.\nStuart: Are you crazy? That helmet\u2019s signed by Robert Downey Jr.\nLeonard: So?\nStuart: Okay, if you\u2019re going to question the importance of an actor\u2019s signature on a plastic helmet from a movie based on a comic book, then all of our lives have no meaning!\nLeonard: Okay, fine. Just the sword, two ten.\nStuart: Thank you. I can eat meat this week.\nLeonard: See that? I just saved us forty bucks.\nSheldon: I\u2019ve long said, what you lack in academic knowledge you make up for in street smarts.\nStuart: You want me to wrap it?\nLeonard: No, it\u2019s okay. I\u2019m gonna stab my friend in the chest.\nWil Wheaton (entering): Hey, Stuart.\nStuart: Ah, hey, Wil.\nSheldon: Hello, Wil Wheaton.\nWil: Hi, Sheldon. Nice sword.\nSheldon: It\u2019s part of my sword collection. Do you have a sword collection?\nWil: No.\nSheldon: I\u2019m not surprised.\nStuart: Here\u2019s the Batman 612 with the Jim Lee alternate cover that you wanted.\nWil: Awesome. What do I owe you?\nStuart: Forty bucks.\nWil: Good deal.\nSheldon: Sucker. Didn\u2019t even ask for the friends and family discount.\nWil: Hey, I\u2019m having a party at my house on Friday, and I was hoping you would stop by.\nStuart: Will there be girls there?\nWil: Yeah, of course.\nStuart: \u2018Cause there wasn\u2019t last time.\nWil: There will be girls. You guys are invited if you want to come by.\nLeonard: Thank you.\nWil: All right, great. Later.\nSheldon: I see what you\u2019re doing. You accept an invitation to a party at the home of my sworn enemy, he tells everyone we\u2019re going to be there, and when we don\u2019t show, he looks the fool. Fiendishly clever.\nLeonard: I was actually thinking about going.\nSheldon: And then declaring the party a fiasco and storming out, leaving him humiliated in front of his guests. Love it.\nLeonard: No, I was gonna grab Raj and Howard and have a good time.\nStuart: Oh, great, more guys. It\u2019s gonna be another Wil Wheaton sausage-fest.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: Sheldon, can you grab me a water?\nSheldon: Possibly.\nLeonard: Can you or can\u2019t you?\nSheldon: It\u2019s not that simple, Leonard.\nLeonard: It never is, is it?\nSheldon: At this moment, our relationship exists in two mutually contradictory states. Until you either do not go or go to Wil Wheaton\u2019s party, you are simultaneously my friend and not my friend. I\u2019m characterizing this phenomenon as Schrodinger\u2019s Friendship.\nLeonard: Got it. Can I have my water?\nSheldon: Of course. Now get it yourself, you traitor.\nPenny: Wait, what is going on?\nSheldon: In case you have forgotten, Schrodinger\u2019s cat is a thought experiment\u2026\nPenny: No, no, no, no, I didn\u2019t forget. Um, there\u2019s this cat in a box and until you open it, it\u2019s either dead or alive or both. Although, back in Nebraska, our cat got stuck in my brother\u2019s camp trunk, and we did not need to open it to know there was all kinds of dead cat in there.\nAmy: Homespun stories, knowledge of physics and a bosom that defies it. You\u2019re the whole package, aren\u2019t you?\nHoward (arriving): Sorry I\u2019m late. Uh, I got great news. NASA picked my team\u2019s design for the deep field space telescope that\u2019s going on the International Space Station this spring.\nAll: Wow.\nBernadette: Howie, that\u2019s wonderful! Congratulations!\nHoward: It gets better. Someone has to go up with the telescope as a payload specialist, and guess who that someone is.\nSheldon: Mohammed Lee.\nHoward: Who\u2019s Mohammed Lee?\nSheldon: Mohammed is the most common first name in the world, Lee, the most common surname. As I didn\u2019t know the answer, I thought that gave me a mathematical edge.\nHoward: It\u2019s me, Sheldon. It\u2019s me. I\u2019m going up in space! Technically, I\u2019m an astronaut.\nAll: Wow, that\u2019s amazing!\nBernadette: Hang on a second. NASA doesn\u2019t have a shuttle any more. How are you going to get up there?\nHoward: Oh, well, it\u2019s really cool. You fly to Moscow, they take you out to Kazakhstan, and then you get into a Russian Soyuz rocket which shoots you into a low earth orbit. Or just sits there on the launch pad because the Kazakhi mafia sold the rocket fuel on the black market.\nBernadette: Are those Russian rockets safe?\nHoward: Well, I mean, safe as it can be when it was built by the good folks who brought you Chernobyl.\nLeonard: I\u2019d like to propose a toast. The dream to go up into space is one we all share, and Howard\u2019s making that a reality. We\u2019re all very proud of you.\nAll: Cheers.\nSheldon: That was a lovely toast. Kudos.\nLeonard: Thank you.\nSheldon: Simultaneously, a festival of cloying clich\u00e9s. You sicken me.\nScene: Bernadette\u2019s car.\nHoward: You\u2019re really quiet. Is everything okay?\nBernadette: Fine. Just a little tired.\nHoward: I hope not too tired, because I\u2019m feeling particularly masculine right now. All systems go, if you catch my drift.\nBernadette: I always catch your drift.\nHoward: All right, well, something\u2019s obviously bugging you. What is it?\nBernadette: I just can\u2019t believe you signed up for the space program without even talking to me.\nHoward: Oh, I get it. You\u2019re worried about me. That is so sweet. You know, there\u2019s a saying we have at NASA. What makes the right stuff so right is that it always comes home.\nBernadette: Just stop talking, Howard.\nHoward: This isn\u2019t the reaction I expected when I told you I was gonna be an astronaut.\nBernadette: What did you think was going to happen?\nHoward: Honestly? Sex.\nBernadette: Howard.\nHoward: Do you realize what a big deal this is? What an honour it is to be chosen to go into space?\nBernadette: Yeah, I get it. I just wish you included me in the decision. We\u2019re supposed to be partners. We\u2019re supposed to be a team.\nHoward: I\u2019m sorry. You\u2019re right. Okay, let\u2019s try this again. Bernadette, an opportunity has come up that impacts both of us, and I\u2019d like to discuss it.\nBernadette: Okay.\nHoward: I\u2019ve been offered a chance to go up to the International Space Station for three weeks. What are your thoughts on that?\nBernadette: Well, first of all, thank you for including me in the decision-making process.\nHoward: Hey, we\u2019re a team. So, what do you think?\nBernadette: No.\nHoward: No?\nBernadette: No.\nHoward: Well why not?\nBernadette: Howard, my father was a police officer. We never knew from one night to the next if he was going to come home alive. It was horrible. And I don\u2019t want to live that way with you.\nHoward: Hey, my father abandoned me and my mother when I was 11. We never saw him again.\nBernadette: Oh, boo-hoo, you\u2019re not going to space!\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: Pretty cool about Howard, huh?\nSheldon: Don\u2019t talk to me as if nothing\u2019s happened between us. And yes, it sure is, buddy.\nLeonard: For God\u2019s sake, will you stop with the Schrodinger stuff.\nSheldon: Would you prefer a simpler application of Heisenberg\u2019s uncertainty principle, in which I could either know where you are or whether I like you, but not both?\nLeonard: You never stop talking, do you?\nAmy: I don\u2019t understand. What differences does it make if Leonard goes to Wil Wheaton\u2019s party?\nPenny: Wil Wheaton is Sheldon\u2019s mortal enemy.\nAmy: Mortal enemy?\nPenny: Mm-hmm.\nAmy: Sheldon, I know you\u2019re a bit of a left-handed monkey wrench, but, you really have a mortal enemy?\nSheldon: In fact, I have 61 of them. Would you like to see the list?\nPenny: Oh, say no, say no, say no, say no.\nSheldon: You just got off the list. Would you like back on it? This\u2019ll just take a moment. It\u2019s on a five and a quarter inch floppy.\nAmy: A floppy disk?\nSheldon: Well, I started the list when I was nine.\nAmy: How did Wil Wheaton get on the list?\nAll: Oh! Oh, God!\nSheldon: As a child, I loved Wesley Crusher, Wil Wheaton\u2019s character on Star Trek. So, I drove for hours by bus to a Star Trek convention at which Wil Wheaton was scheduled to appear, so that I could get my Wesley Crusher action figure signed. But he never showed, because apparently, it was cooler for him to be the lower-left corner on Hollywood Squares. Oh, damn! The floppy failed. Well, whoever was in charge of quality control at the Verbatim Corporation in 1989, congratulations, you just made the list.\nScene: Howard\u2019s bedroom.\nBernadette: Howard?\nHoward: Change your mind about sex? I\u2019m still mad, but I\u2019ll do it.\nBernadette: No, I\u2019ve just been thinking. It doesn\u2019t matter if I\u2019m afraid for your safety. I don\u2019t want to be the person who stands between you and your dreams.\nHoward: Really?\nBernadette: Really. If going into space means that much to you, I will never say another word about it.\nHoward: Thank you.\nBernadette: I love you.\nHoward: I love you, too. So, sex now?\nBernadette: Okay. I just forgot to brush my teeth. I\u2019ll be right back. (Exits)\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Over my dead body my son goes into outer space!\nBernadette: I\u2019m ready.\nScene: The cafeteria.\nLeonard: Wait, let me see if I got this right. You actually asked Bernadette to leave your house in the middle of the night?\nHoward: What choice did I have? She went behind my back and turned my own mother against me.\nRaj: Wow. You\u2019re not only our first astronaut. You\u2019re also the first one of us to kick a girl out of bed. You\u2019re like a rock star.\nHoward: Little bit.\nLeonard: I hate to say it, but she did kind of betray you.\nSheldon: Interesting. You see betrayal in others, but not yourself.\nLeonard: Going to Wheaton\u2019s party is not betraying you.\nSheldon: Oh, of course you would have to believe that. Evil always thinks it\u2019s doing right. Excuse me, Stormtrooper. These are the droids you\u2019re looking for.\nLeonard: I\u2019m going to a party. I\u2019m not turning R2-D2 and C-3PO over to the empire!\nSheldon: Not yet.\nRaj: So, what\u2019s gonna happen next? Are you and Bernadette going to break up?\nHoward: I don\u2019t know. If we\u2019re going to get back together, she\u2019s going to have to apologize and accept that I\u2019m a grown man who can make his own decisions.\nRaj: Then she\u2019s going to have to convince your mother to let you go into space.\nHoward: Obviously.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment.\nBernadette: I had no choice. I had to tell his mother. He can\u2019t go to space. He\u2019s like a baby bird. Do you know he once got an asthma attack from reading an old library book?\nAmy: You\u2019re kidding.\nPenny: No, I was there that day. Sheldon threw his back out handing him that book.\nBernadette: I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do. I don\u2019t want to break up over this.\nPenny: Okay, why don\u2019t you just tell him you made a mistake?\nBernadette: Do you guys think it was a mistake? Am I the bad guy in this?\nAmy: It\u2019s not for us to judge. We\u2019re just here to provide comfort and support while you come to grips with what a despicable thing you\u2019ve done.\nBernadette: Oh, God, you\u2019re right. I took our love and threw it under his bus-sized mother. I need to apologize.\nPenny: Well, that, that\u2019s good. I\u2019m glad you came to that. But before you do, let me just ask you a big picture question.\nBernadette: What?\nPenny: Are you a hundred percent positive you love and want to marry Howard Wolowitz?\nBernadette: I do, with all my heart.\nPenny: Got it. Just had to check.\nAmy: He\u2019s great.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: All right, Sheldon, we\u2019re going to Wil\u2019s. This is your last chance.\nSheldon: No, Leonard, this is your last chance. One day, a historian is going to come to you and say, is it true you were friends with Dr. Sheldon Cooper? And you\u2019re going to have to choke back a hot sob of regret and humiliation as you mumble, I was, but I chose to go to a party thrown by the one kid from Stand By Me that no one remembers.\nLeonard: You want to drive?\nRaj: Sure.\nLeonard: Hey, Sheldon?\nSheldon: Oh, good. You picked me, you picked me.\nLeonard: No, I just got a text from Stuart. Brent Spiner is at the party.\nSheldon: Brent Spiner?\nLeonard: Yes.\nSheldon: I don\u2019t care.\nLeonard: Really? Brent Spiner, Mr. Data himself. You love him.\nSheldon: I did, but I think I\u2019ve kind of outgrown Star Trek. You know, stock characters, ludicrous plots, beam me up. What a load of hooey.\nLeonard: I\u2019m going. Live long and prosper, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Yeah, even that. You look like a dork.\nScene: Howard\u2019s bedroom.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Howard, Bernadette\u2019s here!\nHoward: Tell her I\u2019m not home!\nMrs Wolowitz (off): What kind of a schmuck play is that? She can hear you shouting!\nBernadette: Can we talk?\nHoward: You can. I have nothing to say.\nBernadette: All right. I just wanted to tell you I\u2019m sorry I said something to your mother.\nHoward: I was gonna tell her eventually, but you went behind my back.\nBernadette: I know. I\u2019m sorry. I got scared.\nHoward: If you\u2019re gonna love me, you\u2019re gonna have to love the whole package, the tenderhearted poet and the crazy daredevil.\nBernadette: I know.\nHoward: Well, don\u2019t say it if you\u2019re not gonna mean it, \u2019cause I\u2019m not just gonna stop with the space station. Yeah, I want to go to the Moon, I want to go to Mars. I want to take a one-man sub to the lowest depths of the ocean.\nBernadette: Really? You got seasick on Pirates of the Caribbean.\nHoward: Well, those big kids were rocking it.\nBernadette: I just did what I did because I love you so much, and the thought of losing you is more than I can handle.\nHoward: Really?\nBernadette: You\u2019re my soul mate. This is where you kiss me.\nHoward: Right, right.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Make up all you want! Your tuchus is not leaving this planet!\nScene: Wil Wheaton\u2019s party.\nRaj: Hey, you know that beautiful actress who plays the Borg Queen in First Contact?\nLeonard: Yeah.\nRaj: Well, I just met her gynaecologist!\nLeonard: What are you doing here?\nSheldon: Fighting for our friendship. As peculiar and annoying as you can be, you\u2019re still my little buddy. I\u2019m not going to let that end here tonight. Now put down that drink, let\u2019s meet Brent Spiner and go home.\nWil: Hey, Sheldon, I\u2019m so glad you made it. I found something I think you might like.\nSheldon: What I\u2019d like is for him to have a more depressing home. This is quite lovely.\nWil: This is for you.\nSheldon: An original mint-in-package Wesley Crusher action figure.\nWil: I remembered your story about the time you went to a convention when you were a kid to get one signed, and I didn\u2019t show up.\nWil: Look at what I wrote.\nSheldon: To Sheldon, sorry this took so long. Your friend, Wil Wheaton.\nWil: It\u2019s my last one. I want you to have it.\nSheldon: Look, everyone. Wil Wheaton is my friend!\nBrent Spiner: Oh, wow. I haven\u2019t seen one of these in years. (Rips open action figure packaging) Remember how we used to make these things look like they were masturbating?\nSheldon: Brent Spiner, what have you done? That was an original mint-in-package Wesley Crusher action figure signed by my close personal friend, Wil Wheaton.\nBrent: Sorry, Slim. I\u2019ve got some Mr. Data dolls in the trunk of my car. You want me to sign one for you?\nSheldon: You\u2019ve already signed something, Brent Spiner. Your name on my list. From this moment on, you are my mortal enemy.\nWil: Don\u2019t worry. It doesn\u2019t take up a whole lot of your time.\nSheldon: Come on, buddy. Let\u2019s not waste another second on this loser. Love your house.\nLeonard: Can we get autographed dolls?\nBrent: Sure. Twenty bucks.\nLeonard: Ten.\nBrent: Eighteen.\nLeonard: Twelve.\nBrent: Sixteen.\nLeonard: Two for thirty. And you come to my birthday party.\nBrent: Done.\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "9_16": "\n\t\t\t\tFollowing a \u201cpreviously on\u201d sequence.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s kitchen.\nHoward: Morning.\nBernadette: Morning.\nHoward: We? What is this?\nBernadette: I don\u2019t know. Maybe it says something on the back.\nHoward: Continued on milk. If you\u2019re tricking me into making my own breakfast, it didn\u2019t work for my mom, and it won\u2019t work for you. Are. We are. See spoons for more.\nBernadette: What could it be? We are Groot? We are the champions? We are family? I got all my sisters with me?\nHoward: Are you serious?\nBernadette: Yeah.\nHoward: Are you sure?\nBernadette: Pretty positive. That\u2019s a joke, because the pregnancy test says\u2026\nHoward: Oh, my God. This is incredible. We\u2019re gonna be parents? We\u2019re gonna get to board planes first. Finally gonna get to see what\u2019s in that family bathroom at the mall.\nBernadette: I know, it\u2019s crazy.\nHoward: It is crazy. Oh. I mean, how do you prepare for something like this? I\u2019m not even sure I\u2019ve held a baby before.\nBernadette: Oh, it\u2019s okay, you\u2019ll figure it out.\nHoward: But how\u2019s this all gonna work? Do we get a nanny? I mean, can we afford a nanny? And if we can, we can\u2019t get a pretty one, \u2019cause it\u2019ll wreck our marriage. We can\u2019t get an ugly one, \u2019cause it\u2019ll scare the kid.\nBernadette: I don\u2019t know, Howie.\nHoward: Are we in a good school district? You\u2019re Catholic, I\u2019m Jewish. What religion do we raise it? And if it\u2019s a boy, do we get him circumcised? People say it\u2019s barbaric, but if we don\u2019t, it looks like a pig in a blanket.\nBernadette: Calm down, it\u2019s gonna be okay.\nHoward: How\u2019s it gonna be okay? Look at me, I\u2019m a mess. And that means this baby\u2019s gonna be half a mess. And that\u2019s even before we screw it up with our cut-rate moderately attractive nanny.\nCredits sequence. \nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: Hey, Raj, I read a couple of guys in your department may have discovered a new planet in our solar system?\nSheldon: Oh, I heard about that. Why didn\u2019t you discover it?\nRaj: Because instead of being in the telescope room, I was busy making you guys home made jam for the holidays.\nSheldon: Well, you be sure to let us know when you win the Nobel Prize for boysenberry.\nLeonard: Hey.\nSheldon: Hello.\nRaj: Hey, bud.\nLeonard: Ready to play when you are.\nHoward: Yeah, um, in a minute. I actually need to tell you guys something.\nRaj: If it\u2019s thank you for the home made jam you got in December, congratulations, you\u2019re the first one.\nLeonard: What\u2019s going on?\nHoward: I\u2019m, uh, uh, gonna be a father.\nLeonard: What? Congratulations.\nRaj: That\u2019s so amazing.\nSheldon: Oh, no.\nLeonard: Why oh, no?\nSheldon: Because this changes everything. What about comic book night? Uh, what about playing games together? What about our trips to Disneyland? How can we do those things with a child around?\nLeonard: Relax, there\u2019s room for two babies in this group.\nSheldon: Oh, dear lord, Penny\u2019s pregnant, too?\nLeonard: You\u2019re the other baby.\nSheldon: Oh, really? Okay, well, would a baby have to shave once every 11 days?\nLeonard: Would an adult refuse to eat his graham crackers because one of them was broken?\nSheldon: I guess we\u2019ll call this a draw.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s patio.\nBernadette: So, I\u2019m glad you guys are here. There\u2019s something I want to share with you. Howie and I are going to\u2026\nPenny (reading text): Leonard says you\u2019re pregnant.\nAmy: What?\nPenny: Don\u2019t say anything. act surprised when she tells you. All right, how you want to do this?\nBernadette: I\u2019m pregnant.\nPenny: Oh, my God, I can\u2019t believe it.\nAmy: This is so exciting.\nBernadette: Yeah, it\u2019s all real exciting.\nPenny: Are, are you not happy about this?\nBernadette: I am. Of-of course I am. I\u2019m, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s just the hormones. But it\u2019s weird, Howie\u2019s the one who\u2019s been talking about having kids for years, and I was all excited to tell him because I thought he\u2019d be thrilled, but then he started to flip out and now this feels like a bad idea and I\u2019m gonna get fat.\nPenny: No, no, come on. Come on, you\u2019re not gonna get fat. You\u2019re gonna be beautiful and glowing and, and have the cutest little baby bump ever.\nBernadette: Easy for you to say, skinny bitch. Sorry, hormones.\nPenny: Oh, that\u2019s all right. All I heard was skinny.\nAmy: I wouldn\u2019t make too much out of Howard not reacting the way you expected him to.\nPenny: Yeah, I\u2019m sure it was just the initial shock of it all.\nBernadette: You\u2019re probably right. After we talked about it, he started to calm down.\nScene: The apartment. \nHoward: I shouldn\u2019t be raising a kid. I don\u2019t even eat my own vegetables.\nLeonard: Buddy, I, I think you might be overreacting.\nHoward: And then there\u2019s this nose. I mean, what if he looks like me? Or worse, what if she looks like me?\nSheldon: Not to mention the impact on our social circle. Everything\u2019s going to change. Howard won\u2019t be able to come over as much.\nRaj: Well, he could bring the baby here.\nSheldon: Oh, but then we\u2019d have to baby-proof the apartment. You know, my sister has one of those toilet locks in her bathroom. I have two doctorates, I still had to go in the sink.\nHoward: Oh, my God, and do you have any idea how expensive having a kid is?\nRaj: I read that in Los Angeles, raising a child through college can cost over a million dollars.\nHoward: A million dollars? God, it\u2019s like my nuts just kicked me in the nuts. That\u2019s it, I got to start earning more money right now.\nRaj: I know, you could ask Bernadette for a raise in your allowance.\nHoward: This isn\u2019t a joke.\nRaj: I wasn\u2019t joking.\nLeonard: It\u2019ll be fine. People have kids every day. You\u2019ll figure this out.\nRaj: Yeah, come on, this is great news and you know it.\nHoward: You\u2019re right, it is, I\u2019m just a little overwhelmed right now.\nLeonard: Hey, you know what we should do?\nSheldon: All get vasectomies so this doesn\u2019t happen to us?\nLeonard: Go out and celebrate. But not your worst idea.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s patio.\nAmy: Hey, let\u2019s go do something to get your mind off this.\nPenny: Yeah, yeah, we should go out.\nBernadette: Where?\nPenny: Uh, I don\u2019t know, a bar?\nBernadette: Can\u2019t drink.\nPenny: We can, but all right.\nAmy: Are you hungry? How about that sushi place you love?\nBernadette: Doctor said I can\u2019t have sushi.\nPenny: Okay, look, we don\u2019t have to go anywhere. We can just, you know, stay here and hang out in the hot tub.\nBernadette: Doctor said I can\u2019t go in the hot tub.\nAmy: Maybe you should get a new doctor. What, he said you can\u2019t laugh either?\nScene: A bar.\nRaj: I\u2019d like to propose a toast to our friend, Howard, his, um, his big heart, his beautiful soul\u2026\nLeonard: And his tight little pants that somehow did not make him sterile.\nAll: Cheers.\nHoward: Well, look at this. I bet whoever invented tiny umbrellas doesn\u2019t have to worry about money. He can have all the kids he wants.\nSheldon: And can keep a small portion of their heads dry.\nHoward: If I\u2019m gonna have any chance of raising this kid, I need to come up with a big idea to make some money.\nLeonard: There\u2019s no reason you can\u2019t.\nHoward: That\u2019s easy for you to say. You and Sheldon already came up with your superfluid helium model.\nLeonard: That\u2019s just research. We\u2019re never gonna make any money from it.\nSheldon: Forget helium. The real superfluid is the fruit punch in this mug. Reminds me of my daddy\u2019s secret don\u2019t tell mama juice.\nLeonard: Uh, these are strong, you should slow down.\nSheldon: Oh. I\u2019ll just take one last sip. Ah.\nScene: The same, later.\nHoward: Okay, how about this for an invention, slightly bigger cocktail umbrellas.\nLeonard: How is that a new invention?\nHoward: I don\u2019t know, all Apple does is change the size of things and we keep buying them.\nRaj: It\u2019s true. I like my giant iPad and my little iPad almost as much as my regular-sized iPad.\nSheldon: This place is terrific. Why. why have we never been here before?\nLeonard: The same reason we don\u2019t do a lot of fun stuff. You.\nSheldon: That\u2019s some smart talk from a guy who can\u2019t even keep his face in focus. Where\u2019s the bathroom?\nRaj: Uh, it\u2019s in the corner.\nSheldon: Excuse me. Hey, how you doin\u2019?\nRaj: I hope the bathroom is clearly marked.\nLeonard: Doesn\u2019t matter. He\u2019s headed for the kitchen anyway.\nHoward: Maybe that\u2019s an idea, guidance systems for drunk people.\nRaj: They have that. It\u2019s called Uber.\nHoward: Hey. In your supercooled helium experiments, did you create quantum vortices?\nLeonard: Yeah. Why?\nHoward: Well, if you made a guidance system, couldn\u2019t you use those vortices as a gyroscope?\nLeonard: Wow. I\u2019ve never thought about that.\nHoward: And since it\u2019s in a quantum state, it would maintain an infinite persistence.\nRaj: Groundbreaking revelations, tropical drinks. Tell me this isn\u2019t like the best episode of Sex and the City.\nLeonard: You may have actually just come up with something.\nHoward: You think so?\nLeonard: I really do.\nSheldon: You guys, the bathroom here is amazing. There\u2019s people cooking in it.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s patio.\nAmy: Think about all the fun things you get to do when you have a baby.\nPenny: Yeah, yeah, you get to buy toys and little clothes.\nBernadette: I kind of already do that for Howie.\nPenny: And whenever you\u2019re hungry, you\u2019ll be in a minivan with Cheerios all over the floor.\nAmy: Oh, and I just found a new travel cup for Sheldon. It only lets out three at a time. So, when did you guys decide to get pregnant?\nBernadette: Well, we didn\u2019t exactly decide. We were talking about it, and then one night we got a little reckless.\nPenny: Oh, tell us.\nAmy: Yeah, tell us.\nBernadette: No, I\u2019m embarrassed.\nPenny: Oh, come on, we\u2019re all grown-ups. We\u2019ve all done it.\nAmy: Me, me, me too. I\u2019m a grown-up and I\u2019ve done it.\nBernadette: Fine. We were out one night, and things got a little spontaneous.\nAmy: Oh, that sounds juicy.\nBernadette: Well, Sheldon was going on and on about time zones and railroad schedules, and I went out\u2026\nPenny: Wait, I remember that. Hang on. You did it at our place?\nBernadette: Kind of on Sheldon\u2019s bed.\nAmy: What?\nPenny: No.\nBernadette: I was headed to the bathroom, and I passed Howie on his way out. Usually he says, do not go in there, but this time he said, hey, let\u2019s go in here.\nAmy: How could you do that?\nBernadette: I\u2019m sorry, but you know what it\u2019s like when you\u2019re with your man and one thing leads to another.\nAmy: I do know what that\u2019s like. I really do.\nScene: The bar.\nLeonard: I\u2019m not seeing anyone using liquid helium vortices like this.\nHoward: I\u2019m not finding anything either.\nRaj: It\u2019s a good sign.\nSheldon: Oh, wait, I found something.\nHoward: Damn. What is it?\nSheldon: This video. The baby panda sneezes, and the mama panda gets so scared.\nLeonard: Can you focus on what we\u2019re talking about?\nSheldon: All right. Look, now, this may be the rum talking, but as long as the unpinning rate of the vortices is kept within 1.1 and 1.3, the Magnus force issue should be negligible.\nRaj: Even drunk, he\u2019s still smarter than all of us.\nSheldon: And stronger. Who wants to see me beat up the bartender?\nLeonard: I\u2019d enjoy that.\nSheldon: Nah, she\u2019s a good kid.\nHoward: If this is a viable thing, we could get a patent and license it to companies that make guidance systems.\nRaj: Look at that. You\u2019ve known you\u2019re gonna be a father for less than a day and you\u2019re already stepping up.\nLeonard: I\u2019m telling you, you got this.\nHoward: Maybe you\u2019re right.\nSheldon: Of course he\u2019s right. You and I both know how hard it is growing up without a father. That\u2019s why I\u2019m confident you\u2019re gonna be the best dad you can be.\nHoward: Thank you, Sheldon.\nSheldon: You\u2019re welcome. And if he has twins, we can do all kinds of neat experiments on them.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s hot tub.\nBernadette: You guys can go in if you want.\nPenny: No, we\u2019re a team. If you can\u2019t go in, we\u2019re not going in.\nAmy: Then why are we drinking?\nPenny: Okay, it\u2019s not like she\u2019s got the Christ child in there, all right? (Checking text) Oh. It\u2019s Leonard. He says Sheldon\u2019s drunk and they\u2019re gonna do karaoke if we want to join them.\nBernadette: That sounds fun.\nAmy: Oh, no. Sheldon\u2019s drunk texting me.\nPenny: What\u2019s it say?\nAmy: Would you like to sing karaoke with us.\nBernadette: How is that a drunk text?\nAmy: He used a period instead of a question mark. He\u2019s so wasted.\nScene: The bar.\nRaj (rapping): Your movie\u2019s showing, so you\u2019re going. Could care less about the five you\u2019re blowing. Theatre gets dark just to start the show. You spot a fine woman sitting in your row, she\u2019s dressed in yellow, she says hello, come sit next to me, you fine fellow. You run over there without a second to lose, and what comes next, hey, bust a move.\nLeonard (singing): You want it, you got it, oh, you want it, baby you got it\nRaj: Just bust a move,\nLeonard: You want it, you got it, oh, you want it, baby you got it\nRaj: Just bust a move,\nLeonard: You want it, you got it, oh, you want it, baby you got it\nPenny: Hey, guys. Congratulations.\nHoward: Thank you.\nAmy: Hi. How are you doing?\nSheldon: Wonderful. I\u2019m being musically encouraged to bust a move. If I knew what that meant, I might just do it.\nHoward: I\u2019m really glad you\u2019re here. Can we talk?\nBernadette: Sure.\nPenny: So, you gonna get up there later?\nSheldon: A microphone, a room full of inaccurate depictions of Polynesian religion, and a captive audience to hear about it? You bet I am.\nHoward: I\u2019m sorry I freaked out this morning. I want you to know I\u2019m done being scared.\nBernadette: It\u2019s okay to be nervous. I am, too.\nHoward: Thank God, \u2019cause I was lying, you might not have to wait nine months to see someone soil their pants. But I\u2019m also really excited. I mean it.\nBernadette: Me, too.\nHoward: I love you. Mmm. And I\u2019m not just saying that because your breasts are gonna get bigger.\nScene: The same, later.\nPenny (singing): Are we an item? Girl, quit playin\u2019.\nAmy (singing): We\u2019re just friends, what are you sayin\u2019?\nPenny (singing): Say there\u2019s another and look right in my eyes.\nAmy (singing): My first love broke my heart for the first time.\nTogether: And I was like, baby, baby, baby, ooh, like, baby, baby, baby, no, like, baby, baby, baby, ooh, I thought you\u2019d always be mine.\nScene: The same, later.\nHoward (singing): Baby, I need your lovin\u2019, got to have all your lovin\u2019. Baby, I need your lovin\u2019, got to have all your lovin\u2019.\nScene: The same, later.\nRaj (singing): Ooh, baby, baby, baby, baby. Ooh, baby, baby, baby, baby.\nLeonard (singing): Ah, push it.\nBernadette: I appreciate this, but you really\u2026\nLeonard (singing): Push it real good.\nScene: The same, later.\nSheldon (singing): Land where my fathers died, land of the pilgrims\u2019 pride, from every mountainside let freedom ring.\nScene: The same, later.\nHoward: I\u2019d like to dedicate my last song of the evening to my wife, best friend, and now the mother of our child. I love you, Bernie. (Singing) Havin\u2019 my baby, what a lovely way of sayin\u2019 how much you love me. Havin\u2019 my baby, what a lovely way of sayin\u2019 what you\u2019re thinkin\u2019 of me.\nSheldon: You\u2019re kidding. What kind of maniacs have coitus in someone else\u2019s bedroom?\nHoward: Thank you, Pasadena. Good night.\nScene: The apartment.\nPenny: That was such a fun night.\nLeonard: Probably \u2019cause you got to see your man up there rockin\u2019 the mic.\nPenny: Yeah, yeah. I was a little surprised when you decided to beat-box.\nLeonard: Oh. That was really an asthma attack. I just sold it.\nPenny: Well, I am so happy for Howard and Bernadette.\nLeonard: Me, too. So, you ever think about it?\nPenny: Babies? Well, I\u2019m not in a rush but someday, yeah, sure. What about you?\nLeonard: I think we\u2019d make amazing parents.\nSheldon: Will you guys keep it down?\nPenny: On the other hand, we might lack a certain maturity.\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "8_15": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: Amy\u2019s laboratory.\nSheldon: I\u2019ve invented a science joke, would you like to hear it?\nAmy: Sure.\nSheldon: How many Edisons does it take to screw in a light bulb?\nAmy: How many?\nSheldon: Who cares? He stole the idea and doesn\u2019t deserve his own joke.\nAmy: Is that really true?\nSheldon: Of course, that\u2019s how you know it\u2019s a good joke. It not only entertains, it informs.\nBarry: Hey, sowwy to intewupt.\nSheldon: Uh, Barry, uh, how many Edisons does it take to screw in a light bulb?\nBarry: Did you know Edison didn\u2019t actuawy invent the wight bulb?\nSheldon: What do you want, Barry?\nBarry: Just wanted to dwop this off as a wittle thank you for Amy.\nAmy: What\u2019s this for?\nBarry: Your idea weawy hewped me out. My wight-cone quantization paper\u2019s onwine alweady. The wesponse has been amazing.\nAmy: Well, that\u2019s fascinating. I can\u2019t wait to read it.\nSheldon: Oh, no, me as well. Uh, please e-mail it to Sheldon at bazinga dot biz. Why dot biz? Because I just gave you the business. And also bazinga dot com was taken.\nBarry: Anyway, thanks again. Cooper, suck eggs.\nSheldon: Since when do you help out Barry Kripke?\nAmy: Well, I\u2019d been thinking about a cellular automata approach to neuronal connectivity, and I thought it might have some interesting applications to string theory, it\u2019s not a big deal.\nSheldon: Oh, really? When I was doing string theory and hit a dead end, why didn\u2019t you try to help me?\nAmy: I did. You said the only math biologists know is if you have three frogs and one hops away, that leaves two frogs.\nSheldon: That\u2019s pretty funny, that does sound like me. But that doesn\u2019t mean that you should be standing on street corners handing out your math to whatever guy comes along.\nAmy: Sheldon, we\u2019re all scientists. I helped out a fellow colleague. You\u2019re being petty.\nSheldon: I\u2019m being petty? You know Barry and I have a professional rivalry. You heard him, he told me to suck eggs. If we were friends, he would have suggested I suck something more pleasant. Why are you laughing? Did you learn something?\nCredits sequence.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s apartment.\nHoward (on phone): Okay, Ma. Say hi to Aunt Gladys. Yeah, I love you, too. Bye.\nBernadette: Your mom having fun in Florida?\nHoward: Mmm, she loves it. She finally found a place where everyone talks about how sweaty they are. Anyway, she wants us to go to the house and check in on Stuart because he might be lonely.\nBernadette: She\u2019s just being nice.\nHoward: Well, I\u2019m her son, how come she doesn\u2019t send someone to check on me if I\u2019m lonely?\nBernadette: Because you have a wife.\nHoward: Yeah, well, sometimes you work late.\nBernadette: I know you don\u2019t like Stuart being in the house, but the store\u2019s about to reopen, I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll get back on his feet.\nHoward: That would be great. I\u2019d love for things between me and Mom to get back to normal.\nBernadette: Well, normal\u2019s a strong word, but sure.\nScene: The laundry room.\nPenny: Hey.\nSheldon: Hello.\nPenny: You okay?\nSheldon: If I was okay, I would\u2019ve said hello, and not the much more ominous hello.\nPenny: What\u2019s going on?\nSheldon: I\u2019m mad at Amy.\nPenny: Did she leave pit stains in your favourite crop top, too?\nSheldon: No. She helped Barry Kripke make an advancement in string theory.\nPenny: Oh, that sounds like a good thing.\nSheldon: Well, it would be, except that I left string theory because I decided it was a dead end. Yeah, and then she went behind my back to help someone else prove me wrong. My rival, no less. I\u2019m sorry you had to see that.\nPenny: I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t have a camera.\nSheldon: Why would she do this to me?\nPenny: Well, I\u2019m sure she didn\u2019t upset you on purpose. Besides, aren\u2019t you the one who says there\u2019s nothing more important than the advancement of science?\nSheldon: No, I said there\u2019s nothing more important than me advancing science.\nPenny: All right, well, if I\u2019m understanding this right, and all she did was help out another scientist, I\u2019m thinking you might have to let this one go.\nSheldon: Ugh, let it go. I have heard that my whole life. Every time something upsets me somebody says, let it go, you know, like it\u2019s my fault, and it\u2019s not okay to feel the way I feel.\nPenny: I don\u2019t know what to tell you. I mean, why don\u2019t you talk to her?\nSheldon: Is that all you have? Shopworn tidbits like talk to her and let it go? Gee, Penny, life\u2019s giving me lemons. What should I do?\nPenny: Well, you could shove them somewhere.\nSheldon: Okay, now you\u2019re getting creative.\nScene: The comic book store. \nStuart: Thanks again for your help.\nLeonard: No problem.\nRaj: Our pleasure.\nLeonard: The place really looks great.\nRaj: Yeah, you should have burned it down years ago.\nStuart: I keep telling you I didn\u2019t burn it down.\nLeonard: We know, we know, because burning something down for the insurance money is a crime.\nBernadette: Stuart, this place looks amazing.\nStuart: Thanks.\nHoward: You really did a nice job.\nStuart: And thank you for putting up with me staying at your mom\u2019s through all this. I couldn\u2019t have done it otherwise.\nHoward: I appreciate that, and I\u2019m glad you were able to\u2026 is that my mother\u2019s furniture?\nStuart: Yeah, she said I could use it. Doesn\u2019t it look great?\nHoward: Not as great as it looks in the den where it belongs.\nBernadette: Howie.\nHoward: Why don\u2019t you just clean out the whole room? Take the string art clown I made her in third grade and the ribbon I got in swim class for putting my face in the water.\nStuart: What is your problem? She said it was okay.\nHoward: Well, I\u2019m her son, and I say it\u2019s not okay.\nStuart: Some son, looks like you spent ten minutes on that clown art.\nHoward: Well, maybe I should\u2019ve gone to a fancy art school like you. Then I could run a failed comic shop and mooch off some guy\u2019s mother.\nBernadette: Why don\u2019t we leave so you can cool off?\nStuart: I think that\u2019s a good idea. Take him out of my store.\nHoward: Your store? My mother gave you the money to reopen. I\u2019m not going anywhere.\nLeonard: Why don\u2019t we go get the food for the party.\nStuart: Thank you.\nRaj: Smart, looks like we\u2019re being helpful.\nLeonard: Mmm, when really we\u2019re just exiting an uncomfortable situation.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment.\nSheldon: Kripke, you know, of all the people, Barry Kripke. I\u2019m so\u2026 Are you folding that like a crazy person to get me to do it for you?\nPenny: No.\nSheldon: Oh, give me that. Just out of curiosity, if I were to let something go, how would I do that?\nPenny: I don\u2019t know, just think about something else.\nSheldon: Can I think about the spiny anteater?\nPenny: Sure.\nSheldon: The spiny anteater never went behind my back and worked with Barry Kripke. That didn\u2019t help at all.\nPenny: You know, some people try visualization.\nSheldon: How does that work?\nPenny: Okay, imagine your problems are a pen.\nSheldon: Okay.\nPenny: Now imagine you\u2019re holding that pen.\nSheldon: Okay.\nPenny: Now open your hand and let it go.\nSheldon: But I just got this pen. It\u2019s got my initials on it and everything. Look.\nPenny: Sheldon, this isn\u2019t that hard.\nSheldon: I may have a better way that you can teach me.\nPenny: How?\nSheldon: What if I told you that over the past few months Amy has secretly been giving you little puzzles to test your intelligence against chimpanzees in her lab?\nPenny: What? She didn\u2019t give me any puzzles.\nSheldon: Are you sure?\nAmy (in flashback): Boy, I just can\u2019t seem to get these scissors back together. Can you do it?\nAmy (in flashback): Darn it. There\u2019s something in my eye, and I need to sort these coins by size. Can you help?\nAmy (in flashback): Penny? I really want to eat this banana, but it\u2019s stuck inside this bamboo puzzle box.\nPenny: Son of a bitch.\nSheldon: Okay, that\u2019s great. Now, let it go.\nPenny: I can\u2019t believe you were testing me against a chimp.\nSheldon: Well, excuse me, Amy was testing you. I was rooting for you. Good job on that banana box, by the way.\nPenny: Why would she even do this?\nSheldon: She\u2019s been conducting an experiment on apes where they\u2019re given various puzzles to solve. I was surprised at the complexity of the puzzles and thought some humans wouldn\u2019t be able to solve them. That\u2019s when Amy said, want to make this interesting?\nPenny: Make this interesting? You bet money on me?\nSheldon: No, no. We designed an experiment involving you. See? Now, isn\u2019t that interesting?\nPenny: It\u2019s not interesting. It\u2019s incredibly insulting.\nSheldon: Okay, maybe this will help. Imagine you\u2019re holding a pen. Before you go too far, not a special pen with your initials engraved on it, that\u2019ll make the next part really hard.\nPenny: Oh, my, that\u2019s it. Get out.\nSheldon: I don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re mad at me. You should be mad at Amy. Like I was this afternoon. Hey, look at that, I let it go.\nPenny: Get out.\nSheldon: Penny?\nPenny: What?\nSheldon: I think I left my pen in there.\nScene: The comic book store. \nBernadette: I understand why you\u2019re upset, but he worked really hard to get the store ready. And it\u2019s just furniture.\nHoward: It\u2019s my mom\u2019s furniture. It belongs in the house I grew up in, next to that pile of TV Guides and in plain view of what, for a ten-year-old, was a quality piece of string art.\nBernadette: Howie, if the store succeeds, Stuart has a source of income, and he can move out of your mother\u2019s house. Seems like some old furniture is a reasonable price to pay for that.\nHoward: That is a good point. But I didn\u2019t marry you for good points. I married you to blindly support me no matter how ridiculous I\u2019m being.\nBernadette: This is why I had to rewrite our wedding vows.\nScene: A deli.\nLeonard: Hi, we\u2019re here to pick up an order for Comic Center.\nWaitress: Sure, let me go check on that.\nRaj: Dude, I, I think that\u2019s Nathan Fillion.\nLeonard: Oh yeah, look at that.\nRaj: And he\u2019s picking the tomatoes out of his salad just like I do. I always did feel a connection with him. Oh, I have got an idea.\nLeonard: We\u2019re not selling his tomatoes on eBay.\nRaj: No, if we got Captain Reynolds from Firefly to do a signing at Stuart\u2019s store, that would be amazing.\nLeonard: That would be great.\nRaj: So should we go talk to him?\nLeonard: I don\u2019t know. I mean, if he\u2019s not nice, it\u2019s gonna make it hard for me to watch him in anything again.\nRaj: What? The, the guy who plays Jon Snow was a jerk. We still watch Game of Thrones.\nLeonard: He was a jerk because you rear-ended him.\nRaj: I was distracted. It\u2019s weird seeing a member of the Night\u2019s Watch with a kayak strapped to his car. Come on. Hi, excuse me, s, sorry, I, I don\u2019t mean to bother you, but we\u2019re just really big fans of Firefly. And Dr. Horrible.\nNathan Fillion: Oh, uh, I think you made a mistake. I\u2019m not an actor.\nRaj: Don\u2019t say that. I mean, you\u2019re not Dame Judi Dench, but you\u2019re pretty great.\nNathan Fillion: Oh, yeah, I get it, you think I\u2019m Nathan Fillion, but I\u2019m not. So if you don\u2019t mind, I would just love to eat my lunch.\nLeonard: Come on. Sorry to bother you.\nRaj: Don\u2019t know why he\u2019s so grumpy. I got mistaken for that guy in Life of Pi once, and I\u2019m still floating.\nScene: The hallway.\nAmy: Sheldon, it\u2019s me.\nPenny: Oh, hey. Did you see that? I, I figured out how to open the door all by myself. Maybe I\u2019ll fling some faeces around my cage to celebrate.\nAmy: What are you talking about?\nPenny: I know you\u2019ve been giving me secret puzzle tests.\nAmy: Sheldon, open the door.\nSheldon: I can\u2019t. I\u2019m naked.\nAmy: I just saw you.\nSheldon: Hang on.\nPenny: Open the door now.\nAmy: Oh, hey.\nPenny: Pull up your pants.\nAmy: It\u2019s not a big deal. I run tests like this on undergrads all the time. If you fill out some paperwork at the university, I can get you five dollars.\nPenny: I don\u2019t want five dollars. I want my dignity.\nAmy: So what are we talking, like, ten bucks?\nScene: The deli.\nLeonard: Thank you.\nRaj: Thanks.\nLeonard: Sorry again.\nNathan Fillion: No problem.\nRaj: Are you sure you\u2019re not him? Uh, you can tell us. We\u2019re scientists, not crazy fanboys.\nNathan Fillion: All right, fine. I\u2019m him.\nRaj: And you\u2019re eating alone at a deli. I don\u2019t buy it, you\u2019re not him.\nNathan Fillion: I just wanted to eat my lunch in peace. But I really am him. And thank you very much for being a fan. If you want, uh, let\u2019s take a picture.\nLeonard: That would be great.\nRaj: Great.\nLeonard: Yeah, thank you.\nNathan Fillion: You bet.\nRaj: Wait, hang on. If you\u2019re really Nathan Fillion, what\u2019s the line from Firefly about your bonnet?\nNathan Fillion: I swear by my pretty floral bonnet, I will end you.\nLeonard: That\u2019s it, that\u2019s the line.\nRaj: Although, I knew the line, doesn\u2019t make me Nathan Fillion.\nNathan Fillion: Do you want the picture or not?\nRaj: I want a picture with Nathan Fillion.\nNathan: How about a picture with a guy who looks like Nathan Fillion but a little more annoyed than Nathan Fillion usually is?\nLeonard: What do you think?\nRaj: Ah, it\u2019s good enough for Facebook.\nScene: The comic book store.\nLeonard: I can\u2019t believe they did that.\nPenny: I know, it\u2019s so insulting. At one point, they had me figure out how to get a banana out of a puzzle box.\nLeonard: Wait, Sheldon gave me a banana in a box. He was testing me, too.\nPenny: Unbelievable.\nLeonard: And how could a chimp even solve that? That was impossible.\nPenny: Really? You couldn\u2019t get it out?\nSheldon: Thank you.\nAmy: Wow, the store looks great.\nLeonard: So you guys were testing us both? What is the matter with you?\nPenny: Eh, what\u2019s the matter with them is they think they\u2019re so smart they don\u2019t care if they hurt other people\u2019s feelings.\nAmy: That\u2019s not true.\nSheldon: That sounds like us. I still don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re upset. You solved every puzzle faster than all of the chimps.\nAmy: Well, except Barnabas, but he was on Adderall.\nHoward: I\u2019m sorry, but it\u2019s making me crazy.\nBernadette: Can you please just let it go?\nSheldon: Oh, I can help you with that. Imagine you\u2019re holding an ordinary pen. While your favourite pen is safe and secure in your pocket.\nHoward: Hold that thought. (On phone) Hello?\nAmy: How can I make this up to you?\nPenny: The answer\u2019s in this puzzle box. Let\u2019s see if you can open it.\nStuart: You could have at least warned him about the furniture.\nRaj: That\u2019s what I said when we moved it.\nBernadette: You helped him?\nRaj: No, Stuart picked out those throw pillows all on his own.\nLeonard: Hey, you okay?\nHoward: No.\nLeonard: What\u2019s wrong?\nHoward: My mom died.\nBernadette: What?\nHoward: Uh, that was my aunt. Ma took a nap. She never woke up.\nBernadette: Oh, my God, Howie.\nLeonard: I\u2019m so sorry.\nRaj: What can we do?\nHoward: I don\u2019t know.\nSheldon: May I say something?\nLeonard: Not right now, Sheldon.\nSheldon: But I think it would be comforting.\nLeonard: Buddy.\nHoward: No, it\u2019s okay. What?\nSheldon: When I lost my own father, I didn\u2019t have any friends to help me through it. You do.\nPenny: I really thought he was gonna say let it go.\nScene: The apartment.\nRaj (on phone): Okay, thanks, Bernadette. Travel safe. Okay, bye. Well, they\u2019ve booked a flight. They\u2019re heading to the airport now.\nPenny: How\u2019s Howard holding up?\nRaj: He\u2019s hanging in there.\nLeonard: How are you doing, Stuart?\nStuart: Still can\u2019t believe she\u2019s gone. I mean, that woman took me in. If it wasn\u2019t for her, I, I would have been homeless.\nAmy: One of us would have taken you in.\nStuart: Yeah, I don\u2019t recall any offers. But, you know what, uh, I, I\u2019m glad it worked out the way it did because I got to know this wonderful person.\nRaj: Yeah. Mrs. Wolowitz was pretty special. When I first moved to America, Howard was my only friend and she made me feel so welcome in her home. Which says a lot, because, those first few years, she thought I was the gardener.\nPenny: Whenever I saw her, she\u2019d say I was too skinny and try and feed me.\nAmy: She did that to me, too.\nPenny: Don\u2019t take this away from me.\nSheldon: I didn\u2019t care for her yelling. But now that I\u2019m not going to hear it again, I\u2019m sad.\nLeonard: If you want, I can yell at you later.\nSheldon: It won\u2019t be as good.\nLeonard: Let\u2019s have a toast. To Mrs. Wolowitz. A loving mother to all of us. We\u2019ll miss you.\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "5_14": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The apartment. Sheldon is making a video.\nSheldon: Hello. I\u2019m Dr. Sheldon Cooper, and welcome to the premiere episode of Sheldon Cooper Presents Fun with Flags. Over the next 52 weeks, you and I are going to explore the dynamic world of vexillology.\nAmy: Hang on, Dr. C. What\u2019s vexillology?\nSheldon: Vexillology is the study of flags.\nAmy: Cool. I think I just learned something.\nSheldon: Did you have fun doing it?\nAmy: I\u2019ll say.\nSheldon: Fun and information are two sides to this video podcast, not unlike the only two-sided state flag, Oregon. Oh, look. Hello, Mr. Beaver. In future episodes, we\u2019ll answer some burning questions. What\u2019s the only non-rectangular flag? What animal appears most often on flags? What animal appears second most often on flags? And more.\nAmy: Sweet!\nSheldon: Why are you waving a white flag?\nAmy: I\u2019m surrendering to fun.\nSheldon: Now, today\u2019s episode of Fun with Flags is not fun, but it is important. Flags: you gotta know how to hold \u2019em, you gotta know how to fold \u2019em. Let\u2019s start by identifying the parts of our flag. This edge is the hoist, and it\u2019s used to\u2026\nLeonard: Excuse me, sorry, excuse me.\nSheldon: Cut. Did you not see we are rolling?\nLeonard: Sorry. I\u2019m having dinner with Penny. I have to get out of here.\nSheldon: And I have flag knowledge that I have to get out of here!\nAmy: You okay?\nSheldon: No, I\u2019m a little rattled. But like the flag over Fort Sumter, I\u2019m still here. And, take two. Hello. I\u2019m Dr. Sheldon Cooper, and welcome to the premiere episode of Sheldon Cooper Presents Fun with Flags. Over the next 52 weeks, you and I are going to explore the dynamic world of vexillology.\nAmy: Hang on, Dr. Cooper. What\u2019s vexillology?\nSheldon: Vexillology is\u2026 why is there a face on that flag?\nAmy: It\u2019s Ferdinand T. Flag. I thought he might help bring in some younger viewers.\nSheldon: Confound it! You\u2019re right, it\u2019s brilliant. Let\u2019s take it from the top.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The stairwell.\nPenny: That was a really nice dinner. I\u2019m glad you asked me out again.\nLeonard: Me, too, I missed you.\nPenny: You see me all the time. You sure you just don\u2019t miss the sex?\nLeonard: Well, yeah, sex with you is pretty great. Have you ever tried it?\nPenny: I have. You are not wrong. I just think if we\u2019re gonna try dating again, we should take things slow.\nLeonard: Oh, I can take it slow. Did I ever tell you about my first girlfriend in high school, Karen Berberick? To this day she doesn\u2019t know we were going out. Made it easier on her when I broke things off.\nPenny: Okay, well, maybe not that slow.\nLeonard: How about this, are you familiar with the typical development for computer software?\nPenny: You know, just for fun, let\u2019s say I\u2019m not.\nLeonard: Before an application is released, they give it a trial run. W-We could do that. And if we hit a rough spot, instead of getting mad, just say, hey, we found a bug, and we report it so it can be fixed.\nPenny: You mean like a beta test?\nLeonard: Well, technically, this would be an alpha test. A beta test requires people that weren\u2019t involved in the development of the appli\u2026\nPenny: Seriously, do I not get credit for knowing beta test?\nLeonard: No, you should. Absolutely. That was me being pedantic. That\u2019s our first bug. You reported it. I can fix that. See? This is good.\nPenny: All right. Let\u2019s give it a shot.\nLeonard: Great. You keep a list, I\u2019ll keep a list. At some point, we\u2019ll exchange.\nPenny: Okay. Good night, Leonard.\nLeonard: Night. Attaboy, Hofstadter. Nothing gets the ladies hotter than software development analogies. Hey, I\u2019m back.\nSheldon: Cut! Take 47.\nScene: Sheldon and Raj\u2019s office.\nSheldon: Here\u2019s an interesting fact about flags.\nRaj: I will take that action.\nSheldon: The flags of Liechtenstein and Haiti were identical by coincidence, a fact that wasn\u2019t discovered until they competed against each other at the 1936 Olympics. And thankfully, their embarrassment was overshadowed by the rise of Fascism.\nHoward: Let\u2019s see the new phone.\nRaj: I stopped on the way to work. Hey, do you want to peel the plastic off with me?\nHoward: Really? Me? That\u2019s, like, the best part.\nRaj: Grab a corner. Whoa, what\u2019s your hurry, cowboy? Savour the moment.\nHoward: Oh, yeah.\nSheldon: Speaking of cowboys, do you know what country has not one but two cows on its flag? The tiny landlocked nation of Andorra. Oh, the next classic episode of Sheldon Cooper Presents Fun with Flags is writing itself.\nHoward: Oh, let me try the voice recognition.\nRaj: Hey, I let you peel the plastic, don\u2019t get greedy. (To phone) Hello?\nPhone: Hello.\nRaj: What\u2019s your name?\nPhone: My name is Siri.\nHoward: Look at that. There\u2019s finally a woman in your life you can talk to.\nRaj: Are you single?\nSiri: I don\u2019t have a marital status, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re asking.\nRaj: Yeah, you\u2019re right, that\u2019s too personal. We hardly know each other. How about a cup of coffee?\nSiri: I\u2019ve found six coffee shops. Three of them are fairly close to you.\nRaj: I will see you gentlemen later.\nHoward: She is gonna break his heart.\nScene: The apartment.\nAmy: For someone who has a machine that can travel anywhere in time and space, Doctor Who sure does have a thing for modern-day London.\nSheldon: Careful, it\u2019s that kind of sass that can get a person uninvited to this year\u2019s Who Con.\nPenny: Uh, we\u2019re not counting this as a date, are we?\nLeonard: Um, I\u2019m not sure, but I think the right answer here is no.\nPenny: Bug report: When a guy asks me to spend time with him, maybe he plans something a little more interesting than hanging out at home, watching TV.\nLeonard: Even Doctor Who?\nPenny: Even Doctor Who.\nSheldon: All right, that\u2019s it. Who Con, you\u2019re out.\nLeonard: Okay, bug report taken. Next time I will have a better plan for our evening\u2019s activity.\nPenny: Well, thank you. I\u2019ll see you tomorrow.\nLeonard: Oh, wait, here, almost forgot. Here.\nPenny: What\u2019s this?\nLeonard: My bug report to you.\nPenny: Well, that\u2019s quite a list you got there.\nLeonard: It\u2019s colour coded.\nPenny: Oh.\nLeonard: Uh, red means fix right away. Yellow is eh, whenever you get a chance. And green is I could probably learn to live with it. There\u2019s a key down here at the bottom. It\u2019s neat, huh?\nPenny: Yep.\nLeonard: So, have a good night.\nPenny: Yep.\nLeonard: Look at that. Some day, we will tell future generations that dating used to be hard.\nAmy: What\u2019s baffling me is what you could\u2019ve possibly put on the list. Hair too golden? Laugh too musical? World too much a better place for her mere presence in it?\nSheldon: How about constantly talks with food in her mouth?\nAmy: Her heart\u2019s full of love, no one cares what\u2019s in her mouth.\nScene: Raj\u2019s apartment.\nRaj: So, Siri, what\u2019s happening? How are you?\nSiri: I am well.\nRaj: What are you doing right now?\nSiri: What am I doing? I\u2019m talking with you.\nRaj: You have a beautiful voice.\nSiri: Thank you, it\u2019s nice to be appreciated.\nRaj: I bet it is. Why don\u2019t women like me?\nSiri: Let me check on that. How about a Web search for why don\u2019t women like me?\u201d\nRaj: No need. I\u2019ve already done that. Siri, do you have a last name?\nSiri: My name is Siri.\nRaj: Ah, one name. Like, uh, Cher, Madonna, Adele. All the women who rock me. My name is Rajesh, but you can call me Raj.\nSiri: Would you like me to call you Raj?\nRaj: I\u2019d like you to call me sexy.\nSiri: From now on, I\u2019ll call you sexy. Okay?\nRaj: Okay.\nScene: Sheldon and Raj\u2019s office.\nSiri, I\u2019m in the mood for gelato.\nSiri: (chimes) I found ten restaurants whose reviews mention gelato. Seven of them are fairly close to you.\nRaj: Thank you, darling.\nSiri: You are most certainly welcome, sexy.\nSheldon: Well done, Dr. Koothrappali.\nRaj: I\u2019m sorry?\nSheldon: You\u2019ve taken a great evolutionary leap by abandoning human interaction and allowing yourself to romantically bond with a soulless machine. Kudos.\nRaj: I haven\u2019t bonded with it.\nSheldon: Oh, no, of course. I understand. You\u2019re afraid the world isn\u2019t ready for your taboo love. Your secret\u2019s safe with me.\nRaj: It\u2019s just a phone.\nBarry Kripke: Cooper.\nSheldon: Kripke.\nBarry: Heads up. Pwofessor Wothman urinated in the particle physics wab again, so we\u2019re going to move up his wetirement party. Fwiday, five o\u2019cwock, pot wuck.\nRaj: Thanks, Barry. Siri, remind me Friday morning to make my famous popovers.\nSiri: All right, I\u2019ll remind you.\nBarry (to his own phone): You got Siwi, huh? Voice wecognition on that thing is tewible. Wook. Siwi, can you wecommend a westauwant?\nBarry\u2019s Siri: I\u2019m sorry, Bawwy. I don\u2019t understand wecommend a westauwant.\nBarry: Wisten to me. Not westauwant, westauwant.\nBarry\u2019s Siri: I don\u2019t know what you mean by not westauwant, westauwant.\nBarry: See? Total cwap. You suck, Siwi.\nRaj: Hey, don\u2019t talk to her like that. She\u2019s a lady.\nBarry: Well, that wady took high-wes pictures of my junk wast night for Cwaigswist. Waiter.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment door. Leonard knocks.\nPenny: It\u2019s open.\nLeonard: Hey. You ready to go?\nPenny: Yeah, hang on. Let me just finish this chapter.\nLeonard: Can you finish it later?\nPenny: No, I can\u2019t. Reading books is a big part of my life now because, you know, we\u2019d have more fun things to talk about if I read more.\nLeonard: Great. Good. Great. What are you reading?\nPenny: Two Weeks to Rock Hard Abs.\nLeonard: They kind of spoil the ending right in the name of that, don\u2019t they? All right. Look, just remember how this works. We don\u2019t get mad about these things. Uh, speaking of which, I\u2019ve addressed your bug report on my date planning. Got a really fun evening for you. It\u2019s kind of a surprise.\nPenny: All right. Terrific. Well, let me just go find a pair of shoes that aren\u2019t so tall. We wouldn\u2019t want you to feel like you were out for a walk with your mommy.\nLeonard: Thank you.\nPenny: Yeah. Oh. Here\u2019s my list for you, right there.\nLeonard: All right, fair enough. I certainly can be quieter when we kiss. I thought it was an expression of passion, but if it\u2019s coming across as juicy and weird, who wants that? Uh, uh, I\u2019m sorry, can you be more specific on how my eyebrows are stupid? Nah, never mind, it\u2019s right here.\nScene: Raj\u2019s apartment.\nRaj: Good timing. Dinner\u2019s almost ready.\nHoward: Great.\nBernadette: Oh, smells amazing in here.\nHoward: Yeah, what are we eating?\nRaj: Oh, an exotic little treat. I was just talking to Siri about Peking duck, and she said she knew about four Chinese grocers, two of which were fairly close to me. Her spontaneity is contagious.\nBernadette: Who\u2019s Siri? Is he dating somebody new?\nHoward: Yes. His phone.\nBernadette: Oh. Is that cute or creepy?\nHoward: Uh-huh.\nRaj: Can I pour you some wine? I think you\u2019ll enjoy it. The traditional choice with Peking duck is a Sauvignon Blanc, but Siri suggested an off-dry Riesling. I wasn\u2019t sure, but I didn\u2019t want to have an argument with her in the middle of Trader Joe\u2019s. Now, what should we put Siri in for dinner? Leopard, sparkles, or to paraphrase Coco Chanel, you can never go wrong with a little black case. Siri, play some smooth jazz.\nSiri: Playing smooth jazz.\nRaj: Oh, my God, Kenny G? This woman can read me like a book. I can\u2019t believe I bought my soul mate at Glendale Galleria.\nBernadette: I don\u2019t know if I want to stay.\nScene: A shooting range.\nPenny: This is amazing. How did you even get this idea?\nLeonard: I called your dad. I asked him what things you liked to do when you were a kid. This seemed easier than getting a cow out here so you could tip it.\nPenny: Okay, you\u2019re kind of really great.\nLeonard: You mean for a person whose neck massages feel like an eagle is trying to carry you to its nest?\nPenny: Okay, bug report. I just complimented you. You should take it and shut up.\nLeonard: Right. Sorry, sorry.\nPenny: And stop apologizing all the time.\nLeonard: Right. Sorry.\nPenny: All right, let\u2019s shoot stuff. You want me to show you what to do?\nLeonard: I play a lot of Grand Theft Auto. I think I know how to handle a gat.\nPenny: Wow. You are cute when you get all gangsta. (Kisses him. Leonard accidentally shoots himself in the foot.)\nScene: The stairwell.\nLeonard: So, I\u2019ve got a gunshot wound. That\u2019s pretty badass.\nPenny: No, you\u2019ve got a Reebok with a gunshot wound and an ouchie on your pinkie toe.\nLeonard: Hello? They gave me a Band-Aid. Hospitals do not issue Band-Aids unless it is medically necessary. That is the law.\nPenny: Well, thank you for a really cool evening.\nLeonard: Thank you for hiding my Star Wars socks at the emergency room. Is it a good time to evaluate the beta test and see where we stand?\nPenny: Things are looking good.\nLeonard: So, are we still taking things slow? Because a gunshot wound today, last week, I slammed my thumb in the kitchen drawer. We don\u2019t know how much time I have.\nPenny: Good night, you.\nSheldon: Guten Tag, das YouTube. Ich bin ein Bavarian.\nAmy: Und ich bin eine pretzel!\nSheldon: Und dis is Sheldon Cooper Presents Fun\u2026\nAmy: Mit\u2026\nSheldon: Flags.\nScene: An office suite.\nReceptionist: First door on the left.\nRaj: Thank you. (Enters a door marked \u201cThe Office of Siri\u201d Inside is a red-headed woman sitting at a huge console desk.) \nSiri: Dave, I found six vacuum cleaner repair shops in your area. Four are fairly close to you. (To Raj) Hello, sexy. What can I help you with? If you\u2019d like to make love to me, just tell me. (Raj tries to speak) I\u2019m sorry. I don\u2019t understand.\nRaj (waking from a dream): No!\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "9_22": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The apartment\nPenny: Oh, hey, if you guys are free this weekend, I won a night of wine tasting from work.\nLeonard: That sounds fun.\nPenny: Mm-hmm.\nLeonard: How come scientists don\u2019t win free stuff like salespeople do?\nHoward: \u2018Cause we\u2019re not in it for the stuff. We\u2019re in it for the groupies.\nSheldon: Personally, I find the notion of external rewards demeaning. I pursue science for the intrinsic joy of discovery.\nAmy: But you always say that you want to win a Nobel Prize.\nSheldon: I also say don\u2019t contradict me in front of my friends, but that you don\u2019t remember.\nPenny: All right, well, let me know if you guys want to go.\nRaj: I would love to. I do enjoy the complexity of an aged Pinot noir.\nLeonard: I\u2019m sure that would pair nicely with your fried nuggets of chicken.\nAmy: Well, it sounds like a nice night. We should go.\nSheldon: Wine again? Yeah, no, thank you. I like my grapes the old-fashioned way, in a juice box.\nAmy: Well, I\u2019m going. You couldn\u2019t stop me from getting a massage at the mall, and you\u2019re not stopping me now.\nSheldon: I shouldn\u2019t have to see my girlfriend get groped in public by another man.\nAmy: And I shouldn\u2019t have to see my boyfriend riding on a train for children around the mall.\nPenny: The little choo-choo for toddlers?\nAmy: And now you know why I needed the massage.\nHoward: Well, we\u2019re out. Bernie can\u2019t drink \u2019cause she\u2019s pregnant. And she\u2019s pregnant because we had sex. And we had sex because, well, come on.\nBernadette: It\u2019s okay, you should go.\nHoward: You sure?\nBernadette: Of course.\nPenny: Yeah, give her a break from, well, come on.\nSheldon: Well, Bernadette, looks like Saturday night, it\u2019s you and me.\nBernadette: Me? How? Why?\nSheldon: Well, it makes perfect sense. Because you\u2019re an expectant mother, you can\u2019t drink alcohol. I don\u2019t like to. You can\u2019t have sushi. I don\u2019t like to. You can\u2019t go in hot tubs. I consider them vats of sweaty people soup.\nBernadette: Gee, Sheldon, I don\u2019t know.\nSheldon: Oh, come on. Roller coasters, caffeine, runny eggs, I\u2019ve been avoiding these things all my life. And now, because you\u2019re pregnant, you have to.\nLeonard: The difference is she\u2019s bringing life into the world, and you suck it out.\nBernadette: I guess we could give it a try.\nSheldon: Well, little lady, you\u2019ve heard of party hearty, get ready to party hardly.\nHoward: I bet you\u2019d like a drink right now.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: Howard\u2019s workshop\nRaj: Hey, you think it\u2019d be okay if I brought Claire to the wine tasting?\nLeonard: Sure. I\u2019d like to meet her.\nRaj: Oh, that\u2019s great. I\u2019ve been wanting her to meet you guys, too, so this seems like the perfect opportunity.\nSheldon: Oh, but I won\u2019t be there.\nRaj: Funny how that worked out.\nLeonard: Does this mean Emily\u2019s not in the picture anymore?\nRaj: No, I\u2019m still dating her.\nLeonard: Okay, help me out. How are you doing this? Do they know about each other?\nRaj: They know that we\u2019re not exclusive, and we just don\u2019t ask too many questions.\nSheldon: You know, it\u2019s like how I play Warlords of Ka\u2019a with you and Elder Sign with Frank and Alicia.\nLeonard: Who\u2019s Frank and Alicia?\nSheldon: You, you and I spend a lot of time together. Can there be a little mystery between us?\nHoward: Okay. Everything\u2019s hooked up. We\u2019re ready.\nSheldon: I am going to record this for posterity.\nLeonard: All right, here goes nothing.\nSheldon: Here goes nothing? This is the initial test of our prototype. Can we give it a little more gravitas?\nLeonard: Fine. Preliminary trial of the infinite persistence gyroscopic navigational system, phase one commencing.\nSheldon: Eh, maybe it\u2019s your voice. I\u2019m gonna see if I can get James Earl Jones to do it in post.\nRaj: It\u2019s, it\u2019s beautiful.\nHoward: Actually, it\u2019s making me dizzy.\nLeonard: Good, it\u2019s not just me.\nScene: Raj\u2019s apartment.\nClaire (on phone): Hello.\nRaj: Hey, Claire.\nClaire: Hey, what\u2019s up?\nRaj: Hi, yeah. Um, I was wondering, if you\u2019re free Saturday night, all my friends are going to a wine tasting.\nClaire: Sure, I guess. If you don\u2019t think meeting your friends is too big a step.\nRaj: Why would it be too big a step?\nClaire: I don\u2019t know. I just don\u2019t want things to get weird.\nRaj: Nothing to worry about. People meet people all the time, and it isn\u2019t weird. I met Bon Jovi once, which you\u2019d think might be weird. Turns out, total sweetheart.\nClaire: Okay, but you and I have been keeping things casual. Uh, will you introduce me as your friend or as your girlfriend? What if I like them and they don\u2019t like me? What if they like me and I don\u2019t like them?\nRaj: Boy, it wasn\u2019t this hard with Bon Jovi. I said you rock, he said, thanks, man, and that was that.\nScene: The apartment.\nPenny: Hey, you ready to go?\nLeonard: Hang on.\nPenny: What are you doing?\nLeonard: Oh, I found a scratch-and-sniff book about wine tasting. It teaches the different flavour notes to look for.\nPenny: You actually smell the wine?\nLeonard: I mostly just smell my nasal spray.\nPenny: Are your sinuses acting up?\nLeonard: Since my preschool got a bunny.\nPenny: Hey, are you still hanging out with Bernadette tonight?\nSheldon: Yes. And we\u2019re going to prove that we don\u2019t need alcohol to enjoy ourselves.\nPenny: Oh, good for you.\nSheldon: Or caffeine, tobacco, sushi, soft cheese, processed meats and jacuzzis, which can all be harmful to an unborn baby.\nPenny: No honey baked ham in a hot tub, got it.\nSheldon: Oh, no bubble baths either. They can increase the risk of a urinary tract infection.\nLeonard: Okay, have fun.\nSheldon: Oh, and no swordfish, king mackerel, shark or tilefish, which are all high in mercury.\nLeonard: We\u2019re leaving now!\nSheldon: Oh, and no contact with guinea pigs or hamsters or their droppings, uh, no-no cat litter boxes, no paint fumes.\nPenny: Okay, we\u2019re leaving, love you, bye.\nSheldon: Boy, do I love restrictions.\nScene: The wine tasting.\nHoward: Hey. Where is everybody?\nAmy: Oh, we\u2019re the first ones here.\nHoward: Oh. Cool.\nAmy: Yeah. Cool.\nHoward: You know, I don\u2019t remember the last time it was just you and me hanging out.\nAmy: Oh, I do. It was three years ago.\nHoward: Oh, yeah, and we said we should do it more often. And, and, and, and, and here we are.\nAmy: So, Sheldon and Bernadette are hanging out.\nHoward: I know. What are they gonna talk about?\nAmy: I don\u2019t know. I really don\u2019t know.\nLeonard: Hey.\nHoward: Oh, good.\nAmy: Oh, thank God.\nPenny: You guys been here long?\nHoward: No, two minutes.\nAmy: But yes.\nHoward: Where\u2019s Claire?\nRaj: Oh, she\u2019s meeting us here. Hey, guys, do me a favour and don\u2019t ask too many questions about the relationship. We\u2019re just keeping it casual.\nLeonard: Oh, so I shouldn\u2019t ask her how she feels about being a member of your harem?\nRaj: Yeah, I know you\u2019re teasing, but watch out for karma.\nAmy: Hey, Penny, isn\u2019t that your old boyfriend Zack?\nPenny: Oh, yeah.\nAmy: Are you gonna say hi to him?\nPenny: Uh, I don\u2019t know.\nRaj: Hey, while you decide, who was better in bed, big hot Zack or wheezy little Leonard? Neener neener.\nScene: The apartment.\nBernadette: I brought sparkling cider.\nSheldon: Oh, the bubbles tickle my nose. I\u2019ll just open this now so it can get nice and flat before we drink it.\nBernadette: So what do you want to do tonight?\nSheldon: Oh, I have quite the evening planned. Our foetus-friendly festival of fun begins with an in-depth look at the world of model trains, and then we\u2019ll kick things up a notch and explore all the different ways that you can make toast.\nBernadette: There\u2019s more than one?\nSheldon: You\u2019ve heard of French toast?\nBernadette: Yeah.\nSheldon: Cinnamon toast?\nBernadette: Yeah.\nSheldon: Melba toast?\nBernadette: Yeah.\nSheldon: You get where I\u2019m going here?\nBernadette: Yeah.\nScene: The wine tasting.\nAmy: I\u2019m getting an earthy note.\nPenny: Ah, there\u2019s definitely some oak.\nRaj: Also, uh, cherries?\nLeonard: I smell nothing.\nHoward: Really? Nothing?\nLeonard: Just a whole lot of Afrin.\nZack: Penny?\nPenny: Oh. Zack, hi. You guys remember Zack.\nHoward: Yeah, hey, buddy.\nAmy: Hello.\nRaj: Hey.\nZack: Hey, did you two get married?\nPenny: We did.\nLeonard: Yeah, mm-hmm.\nZack: To each other?\nPenny: Yes.\nZack: Cool. \u2018Cause other than when you broke up with him and dated me, then broke up with me, and then dated me one more time before going back to him, I was always rooting for you two.\nLeonard: Thanks.\nZack: So how\u2019s the science world? What are you guys up to?\nHoward: We\u2019ve actually been working on a prototype for a navigation system we invented.\nLeonard: But we won\u2019t bore you with the details.\nZack: Are you kidding? I love science. Einstein, Stephen Hawking, Mike deGrasse Tyson.\nAmy: Mike deGrasse Tyson?\nHoward: Yeah, you know, the boxer who grew a moustache and became a scientist.\nZack: So what\u2019s your invention?\nHoward: Well, we\u2019re using quantum vortices to replace gyroscopes in guidance systems.\nLeonard: What\u2019s neat is that they can maintain angular momentum indefinitely.\nZack: Angular momentum. I was wondering about that.\nHoward: You could put it in a satellite or a rocket, and it\u2019ll run forever.\nZack: Cool. Could it be used for missiles and war stuff?\nHoward: Yeah, but we didn\u2019t create it for weapons.\nLeonard: And I doubt the military would be interested in our little guidance system.\nZack: Is it better than the one they use now?\nHoward: A lot.\nLeonard: Way better.\nZack: Huh. You sure you guys are smart?\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: H-O gauge trains are 1/87th scale. N gauge are 1/160th scale. And that brings us to Z gauge, at a, you could easily swallow it, don\u2019t ask how I know, 1 to 220.\nBernadette: I\u2019m sorry, I have to ask.\nSheldon: When I was five, I ingested a Z gauge locomotive. I spent the next three days saying, I think I can pass it, I think I can pass it, I think I can pass it.\nBernadette: What is it about trains that you like so much?\nSheldon: What an interesting question. When I was a child, life was confusing and chaotic for me, and trains represented order. I could line them up, categorize them, control them. I guess you could say that they gave me a sense of calm in a world that didn\u2019t.\nBernadette: That\u2019s lovely, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Well, other than when they\u2019re chugging through your bowels, these things are magic.\nScene: The wine tasting.\nLeonard: I have to admit, I\u2019ve been worried about the military applications since we started talking about this.\nHoward: Me, too.\nLeonard: Why didn\u2019t you say something?\nHoward: Same reason I don\u2019t talk about ass cancer. It\u2019s not a pleasant topic.\nRaj: You can\u2019t let this stop you. Almost any scientific advancement can be used for destructive purposes.\nAmy: It\u2019s true. Even Einstein\u2019s theory of relativity was later applied to the development of nuclear weapons.\nPenny: E equals MC squared. Yeah. E is for energy, M for mass, and C for the speed of light.\nAmy: How do you know that?\nPenny: Oh, Leonard mumbles it when he wants sex to last longer.\nClaire: Hey, Raj.\nRaj: Hey, Claire. Good, you\u2019re here. Guys, this is my friend Claire. We\u2019re casually dating, and there\u2019s no need for any further questions about it.\nLeonard: Would you like a glass of wine?\nRaj: I said no questions.\nScene: The apartment. \nSheldon: And last but not least, this is one that I like to call Star Wars Toast because it has a light side and a dark side. All righty, it\u2019s time for Dungeons & Dragons.\nBernadette: Dungeons & Dragons? That sounds about right.\nSheldon: You\u2019re gonna enjoy this. I designed it especially for you.\nBernadette: Okay, but just for a little bit.\nSheldon: Oh, I have a feeling that once you start, you\u2019re not gonna want to or be allowed to stop.\nBernadette: All right.\nSheldon: Ready?\nBernadette: You bet.\nSheldon: Your name is Bernatrix. You are a warrior queen. You\u2019re strong, beautiful and tall.\nBernadette: Oh. I like the idea of being tall.\nSheldon: I think you\u2019re gonna like a lot of things I have in store. For example, in this world, only the men get pregnant, so your husband is home trying not to pee when he laughs.\nBernadette: This is getting fun. What\u2019s next?\nSheldon: You\u2019re parched and weary from battle. You stand in front of a tavern that serves the coldest, most delicious ale in all the realm.\nBernadette: Oh, I haven\u2019t had a drink in months.\nSheldon: What do you do?\nBernadette: I storm in, slam my sword down, and say, barkeep, bring me the strongest ale you have and serve it in the skull of a goblin.\nSheldon: He wants to see I.D.\nScene: The wine tasting.\nAmy: So, Claire, we\u2019ve heard so many wonderful things about you.\nClaire: Really? Like what?\nAmy: Uh, mostly Penny\u2019s heard them.\nZack: Boy, you get some dirty looks over there when you ask for ice.\nRaj: Zack, this is my friend Claire.\nZack: You\u2019re hot. You seeing anybody?\nRaj: Uh, she\u2019s seeing me.\nZack: Why\u2019d you say she\u2019s your friend?\nRaj: We\u2019re just keeping it casual.\nZack: Why is he being casual with you? You seem great.\nClaire: I don\u2019t know. Ask him.\nZack: Why are you being casual with her? She seems great.\nScene: The toilets.\nLeonard: Maybe we should take a step back.\nHoward: Take a step back? I\u2019m not a young man any more.\nLeonard: No, I mean re-evaluate what we\u2019re doing with the guidance system.\nHoward: But I got a baby on the way. I got to make some money.\nLeonard: What good is money gonna do if we inadvertently bring about Armageddon?\nHoward: Okay, let me stop you right there. We absolutely know our invention will not be used to destroy the world.\nLeonard: How?\nHoward: Because no one from the future has come back to kill us.\nLeonard: Very funny.\nHoward: You got something better?\nLeonard: Well, not really.\nHoward: Okay, then. Geez, how much wine did you drink?\nLeonard: Not a lot. I just couldn\u2019t start until you walked away.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: The Hell Prawn lunges out of the hot spring. You block it with your shield. Do you attack?\nBernadette: Does it have eyes?\nSheldon: Three giant red ones and they never blink. It\u2019s unsettling.\nBernadette: I stab it in the middle eye.\nSheldon: Good choice. Critical hit. Your sword goes through its eye into its tiny brain. With its final dying gasp, it says, you have reduced me to a pile of sushi. Enjoy me with this packet of soy sauce. It\u2019s low sodium. Aaaah.\nBernadette: Okay, I guess I should eat the Hell Prawn.\nSheldon: Using your sword, you prepare a beautiful sushi dinner. You slip into the hot spring and enjoy the warm water on your aching joints. As you happily close your eyes, you recall the incredible evening you\u2019ve had and notice that your feet and ankles are smaller than they\u2019ve ever been. The end.\nBernadette: Wow, this night turned out to be so much more fun than I thought.\nSheldon: Oh, the fun doesn\u2019t stop. You\u2019re still going home with a goodie bag full of toast.\nBernadette: Thank you for this. You know, ever since people found out I\u2019m having a baby, I feel like I became Pregnant Bernadette. It was nice to take a little break tonight.\nSheldon: I can understand that. From the moment people realized I was a genius, I\u2019ve been Sheldon the Genius. Although I\u2019ve never really wanted a break from that, so I suppose I don\u2019t understand. Which is ironic \u2019cause, you know, genius.\nBernadette: Well, thanks again.\nSheldon: You\u2019re welcome. And any time you need a break from being Bernadette the Pregnant, Bernatrix the Warrior Queen is here waiting.\nBernadette: I might just take you up on that.\nSheldon: Well, mind you now, that offer\u2019s only good until the third trimester. I can\u2019t risk getting amniotic fluid on my spot.\nScene: The wine tasting. \nRaj: Hey, dude, you\u2019re killing me with Claire.\nZack: What are you talking about?\nRaj: I mean, come on, look at you. You\u2019re classically handsome, you\u2019ve got a swimmer\u2019s body. Next to you, I look like me.\nZack: Oh, man, I didn\u2019t mean to do that. But I do appreciate you recognizing my swimmer\u2019s body. Which, incidentally, I got from playing Marco Polo at the YMCA.\nRaj: Yeah, okay, just do me a favour and stop talking about how great Claire is.\nZack: Anything for you, my little foreign friend.\nClaire: So, I got to ask, does Raj bring around other girls?\nPenny: Uh, you know, I\u2019m not really around that much. Amy knows much more than I do.\nLeonard: I don\u2019t think you have anything to worry about. Raj is a terrific guy, loyal to a fault.\nHoward: Yeah. He still has an AOL address.\nZack: I see what you\u2019re saying. She\u2019s not so great.\nRaj: Don\u2019t listen to him. He says crazy things all the time. Uh, watch. Marco.\nZack: Polo.\nRaj: So, uh, what are you guys talking about?\nClaire: Your friends were just telling me about all the other girls you\u2019re dating.\nRaj: Why would you do that? I specifically asked you not to do that.\nPenny: We didn\u2019t.\nAmy: You just did.\nZack: Wow. Maybe none of you guys are smart.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: Morning.\nSheldon: Morning.\nLeonard: Ugh. Too much wine.\nSheldon: Oh, I overdid it myself last night. Hair of the dog.\nLeonard: Hey, did you ever think about the military applications for the guidance system?\nSheldon: Of course.\nLeonard: Does it bother you?\nSheldon: No, it did at first, but then I talked it through with Frank and Alicia, and they really helped put things into perspective.\nLeonard: Who are these people?\nSheldon: Leonard, friends are like toilet paper. It\u2019s good to have extras under the sink.\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "2_18": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The apartment.\nRaj: Knight to queen\u2019s bishop-five.\nHoward: Oh, very nice. What\u2019s Leonard going to do? Does he give up the pawn or does he give up the position?\nRaj: Let\u2019s find out. Leonard, ready?\nLeonard: Ready.\nRaj: Go. (Leonard sprays an aerosol which lights up laser beams. He tries to negotiate the beams as Howard and Raj sing dramatic music. Eventually he touches one of the beams and a buzzer sounds.)\nLeonard: Damn it. I slipped.\nHoward: Too bad. You know the rules of Secret Agent Laser Obstacle Chess. Uh, Leonard died again, Sheldon. You\u2019re up.\nSheldon: Despite my deep love of chess, lasers and aerosol disinfectant, I must forfeit.\nLeonard: Why?\nSheldon: \u2013 Because it\u2019s almost eleven o\u2019clock.\nLeonard: So?\nSheldon: So, Penny has a don\u2019t knock on my door before eleven o\u2019clock\u00a0 or I punch you in the throat rule.\nAll: Ah.\nHoward: Hey, you know what\u2019d be a great idea? We get some girls over here and play Laser Obstacle Strip Chess.\nLeonard: Believe me, Howard, any girl who would be willing to play that, you don\u2019t want to see naked.\nHoward: You underestimate me.\nScene: Outside Penny\u2019s door. Sheldon stands looking at his watch with his hand poised to knock. At the right moment he starts knocking.\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Penny, (knock, knock, knock) Penny, (knock, knock, knock) Penny.\nPenny: Hey, Sheldon.\nSheldon: It\u2019s eleven am.\nPenny: I know. You\u2019re safe.\nSheldon: This package came while you were at work.\nPenny: Oh, great, my rhinestones. Thank you.\nSheldon: Excuse me.\nPenny: What?\nSheldon: You have to sign this.\nPenny: What is it?\nSheldon: When I signed for the package, I was deputized by the United Parcel Service and entrusted with its final delivery. I now need you to acknowledge receipt of the package so that I\u2019m fully indemnified and no longer liable.\nPenny: Sheldon, it\u2019s just a box of rhinestones.\nSheldon: Well, the contents are irrelevant. A legal bailment has been created. Does that mean nothing to you?\nPenny: It means nothing to anybody. Come here, let me show you what I\u2019m doing.\nSheldon: Bailment describes a relationship in common law where a physical possession of personal property, or chattels, is transferred from one person, the bailor, to another person, the bailee.\nPenny: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Look, look, look! I started a business.\nSheldon: Obviously, not a cleaning business.\nPenny: No, I\u2019m making flower barrettes. See? I call them Penny Blossoms. I made one for myself, then all the girls at work wanted one. Then I showed some to this lady who runs a shop in Old Town. She sells cards and homemade jewellery. She said she wanted to sell them. I said okay, and in one week, I made a $156.\nSheldon: Good for you. Sign here.\nPenny: Sheldon, don\u2019t you get it? If this takes off, I won\u2019t have to be a waitress anymore.\nSheldon: But then who will bring me my cheeseburger on Tuesday nights?\nPenny: Another waitress.\nSheldon: What\u2019s her name?\nPenny: I don\u2019t know.\nSheldon: And you\u2019re going to let her handle my food?\nPenny: Nancy. Her name is Nancy.\nSheldon: I think you\u2019re just making that up.\nPenny: Sheldon, I\u2019m sorry about your hamburger, okay? I just don\u2019t want to be a waitress for the rest of my life.\nLeonard: Cheeseburger. I get a cheeseburger.\nPenny: Fine, cheeseburger.\nSheldon: Maybe I\u2019d be better off with Nancy.\nPenny: So, what do you think? I mean, this could be a business, right?\nSheldon: How many of these can you make a day?\nPenny: About twenty.\nSheldon: And how much profit do you make per Penny Blossom?\nPenny: I don\u2019t know, like, 50 cents. I\u2019m not sure.\nSheldon: No, Of course you\u2019re not. All right, ten dollars a day times five days a week times 52 weeks a year is two thousand six hundred dollars.\nPenny: That\u2019s all?\nSheldon: Before taxes.\nPenny: Well, I don\u2019t have to pay taxes on this stuff.\nSheldon: I believe the Internal Revenue Service would strongly disagree. But, if you took advantage of modern marketing techniques, and you optimized your manufacturing process, you might be able to make this a viable business.\nPenny: And you know about that stuff?\nSheldon: Penny, I\u2019m a physicist. I have a working knowledge of the entire universe and everything it contains.\nPenny: Who\u2019s Radiohead?\nSheldon: I have a working knowledge of the important things in the universe. Good luck.\nPenny: Sheldon, hold on. Could you maybe show me how to make more money with this?\nSheldon: Of course I could.\nPenny: Sheldon, wait! Will you?\nSheldon: Just to be clear here, you\u2019re asking for my assistance.\nPenny: Yes.\nSheldon: And you understand that will involve me telling you what to do?\nPenny: I understand.\nSheldon: And you\u2019re not allowed to be sarcastic or snide to me while I\u2019m doing so.\nPenny: Okay.\nSheldon: Good. Let\u2019s begin with the premise that everything you\u2019ve done up to this point is wrong.\nPenny: Oh, imagine that.\nSheldon: Sarcasm. Good-bye.\nPenny: No, sorry. Wait! Please come back!\nCredits sequence.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment. Penny is making a barette. Sheldon is timing her.\n \nPenny: There. Done.\nSheldon: All right. 12 minutes and 17 seconds.\nPenny: Pretty good, right?\nSheldon: That\u2019s 4.9 Penny Blossoms per hour. Based on your cost of materials and your wholesale selling price, you\u2019ll effectively be paying yourself\u2026 $5.19 a day.\nPenny: A day?\nSheldon: There are children in a sneaker factory in Indonesia who outearn you.\nPenny: That just can\u2019t be right.\nSheldon: You\u2019re questioning my math?\nPenny: No, sorry.\nSheldon: Want me to show my work?\nPenny: Oh, God, no, no. Just please tell me what to do about it.\nSheldon: All right, are you familiar with the development that resulted from Honor\u00e9 Blanc\u2019s 1778 use of interchangeable parts? The assembly line, of course.\nPenny: Okay, you know what, if I\u2019m not allowed to be snide, you\u2019re not allowed to be condescending.\nSheldon: That wasn\u2019t a part of our original agreement, and I do not agree to it now.\nPenny: All right, fine. How are we supposed to set up machines and conveyor belts in my apartment?\nSheldon: You\u2019re thinking of the moving assembly line, an understandable but not excusable mistake. No. The moving assembly line, that was introduced by Henry Ford in 1908. That innovation is what made possible our modern consumer culture by enabling a low-unit cost for manufactured goods. I guess that isn\u2019t one of the topics discussed on your Radiohead.\nScene: The apartment\n \nLeonard: Let\u2019s go. We\u2019re going to miss the coming attractions.\nRaj: What\u2019s the matter?\nHoward: I think I bruised a testicle capturing that last pawn.\nFrom Penny\u2019s apartment they hear Penny and Sheldon singing \u201cBlow the man down.\u201d They enter to find Sheldon and Penny working together on the barettes.\n \nLeonard: Hello?\nPenny & Sheldon together: Hello. (They resume singing and working) \nLeonard: W-W-Wait, what\u2019s going on?\nSheldon: I assume you\u2019re referring to the sea shanty. It\u2019s a rhythmic work song designed to increase productivity.\nPenny: Yeah, it\u2019s crazy, but it totally works. Look, we made this Penny Blossom in under three minutes.\nLeonard: Terrific, but that kind of raises more questions than it answers.\nSheldon: Penny\u2019s making hair accessories. I\u2019m helping her optimize her manufacturing process. All right, break\u2019s over. (They start singing again.)\nHoward: Hold on. What are you using as a bonding agent?\nSheldon: Hot glue.\nHoward: You\u2019re kidding. Any of the cyanoacrylates would do a better job.\nSheldon: It won\u2019t work, the flower\u2019s too porous.\nLeonard: What if we infused the bottom layer with silicone-RTV to provide a better mounting surface?\nSheldon: Intriguing.\nHoward (after Raj whispers to him): Good question, what are you marketing and distribution channels?\nPenny: Well, there are the waitresses at my work, and this cute, little shop in Old Town.\nSheldon: Hush, hush, hush, hush, hush, virtually non-existent. I\u2019m thinking that we set her up with a hosted turnkey e-commerce system to start.\nHoward: Why not eliminate the middle man? We could install a small server farm with a static IP in her bedroom.\nLeonard: She\u2019d need some kind of industrial cooling system.\nSheldon: Of course, but before we set up a marketing and distribution infrastructure, we should finish optimizing the manufacturing process. To start with, she has a terrible problem with moisture-induced glitter clump.\nPenny: Yeah, it\u2019s a bitch.\nHoward: Uh, I\u2019ve seen this before.\nLeonard: Where?\nHoward: It\u2019s a common stripper problem. They dance, they sweat, they clump.\nPenny: Ew.\nLeonard: Are you thinking about adding a desiccant like calcium sulphate?\nHoward: Actually, I\u2019m thinking about this one stripper named Vega. But sure, calcium sulphate could work.\nSheldon: Let\u2019s think out of the box for a moment. How about a molecular sieve?\nLeonard & Howard: Oh!\nPenny: I\u2019ve got a spaghetti strainer in the kitchen.\nSheldon: Wow.\nLeonard: Hey, we could liberate some micro-porous charcoal from the chem lab.\nSheldon: Oh, great. Raj, why don\u2019t you and Howard go get the charcoal? Leonard, why don\u2019t you start working on some preliminary Web site designs. I\u2019ll make some space in our apartment so we can move the manufacturing process.\nPenny: Well, what\u2019s wrong with my apartment?\nSheldon: It\u2019s not my apartment.\nPenny: Wait, wait, what am I going to do?\nLeonard: Uh, hey, it\u2019s your business. Do whatever you want.\nPenny: Oh, okay, cool. I\u2019m going to take a nap.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: I\u2019m still tweaking things a little bit, but this will give you the general idea of the Web site. So, what do you guys think?\nHoward (after Raj whispers to him): Uh, pretty much any way I say that is going to hurt his feelings.\nLeonard: Okay, what\u2019s wrong with it?\nSheldon: \u2013 What\u2019s wrong with it?\nLeonard: Not you. I wasn\u2019t asking you. Penny?\nPenny: Uh, well, it\u2019s a little juvenile. I mean, it kind of looks like the MySpace page of a 13-year-old girl.\nLeonard: No, it doesn\u2019t.\nHoward: Please. Dateline could use it to attract predators.\nSheldon: Penny, this is your enterprise, so it\u2019s ultimately your decision, but based on the quality of his work, I\u2019d strongly recommend that we let Leonard go.\nLeonard: You want to fire me?\nSheldon: What I want is irrelevant. This is Penny\u2019s decision. Penny?\nLeonard: Excuse me, but if I did such a bad job then why do we already have orders?\nPenny: We do?\nLeonard: Uh-huh. Look. Mrs. Fiona Fondell from Huntsville, Alabama has ordered two.\nPenny: No kidding. Two?\nLeonard: Uh-huh. Look at the comments.\nPenny: Thank you, Penny Blossoms. These will be perfect to cover my bald spot. Aww, that is so sweet.\nSheldon: Camouflaging bald spots. That\u2019s primarily a male concern. Perhaps we could expand our market.\nPenny: How are flower barrettes going to appeal to men?\nHoward: We add Bluetooth!\nSheldon: Brilliant. Men love Bluetooth.\nPenny: Wait a minute, wait a minute, you want to make a hair barrette with Bluetooth?\nSheldon: Penny, everything is better with Bluetooth.\nLeonard: Holy crap. Someone just ordered a thousand Penny Blossoms.\nPenny: Get out! Who needs a thousand sparkly flower barrettes with rhinestones?\nLeonard: The Fifth Annual East Rutherford, New Jersey, Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender Alliance Luau.\nSheldon: Oh, another market to expand into, balding gay men.\nHoward: And I\u2019ll bet lesbians love Bluetooth.\nSheldon: We should get to work.\nPenny: Wait, wait, wait, why does it say one-day rush? Since when do we offer a one-day rush?\nLeonard: Amazon offers one-day rush.\nPenny: Yeah, but they don\u2019t have to glue the books together. How the hell are we going to make a thousand Penny Blossoms in one day?\nLeonard: Don\u2019t yell at me. I\u2019m not manufacturing. I\u2019m just Web design.\nPenny: Okay, well, I\u2019m gonna have to call them and cancel the order.\nSheldon: Excuse me, but was this not your goal? Financial independence through entrepreneurial brilliance and innovation? My brilliance and innovation, of course, but still.\nPenny: I just don\u2019t see how see can pull this off.\nSheldon: Okay, that, right there, that equivocation and self-doubt, that is not the American spirit. Did Davy Crockett quit at the Alamo? Did Jim Bowie?\nHoward: They didn\u2019t quit. They were massacred by, like, a gazillion angry Mexicans.\nSheldon: Alright, let me put it this way. Your gross receipts on this one order will be over $3,000 for one night\u2019s work.\nPenny: You guys get started.\nLeonard: What are you doing?\nPenny: Going online to buy shoes!\nScene: The same, later. Sheldon and Penny are making barettes, singing \u201cShe\u2019ll be coming round the mountain.\u201d\nRaj: You know, if I wanted to spend my Saturday nights doing this, I could have stayed in India.\nHoward: Oh, stop with the fake third world crap. Your father\u2019s a gynaecologist, and you had a house full of servants.\nRaj: We only had four servants. And two of them were children.\nLeonard: How are we doing?\nRaj: We have 128 assorted Penny Blossoms ready to ship.\nHoward: Oh, God, we\u2019re never gonna finish in time. Who made Sheldon the boss anyway?\nSheldon: I believe I\u2019m hearing some negativity on the factory floor.\nPenny: So?\nSheldon: Penny, the labour force is a living organism that must be carefully nurtured. Any counterproductive grumbling must be skilfully headed off by management. Observe. Hey! Less talk, more work!\nPenny: Nicely done.\nSheldon: Thank you. You hear any union talk, you let me know.\nTime shift\nLeonard (singing): Someone\u2019s in the kitchen with Dinah\u2026\nHoward (reluctantly singing): Someone\u2019s in the kitchen I know-ow-ow-ow\nPenny (singing): Someone\u2019s in the kitchen with Dinah\u2026 Sheldon? Sheldon! (nudges him)\nSheldon (waking up, singing): \u2018Cause I sold my soul to the company store.\nPenny: Honey, do you want some coffee?\nSheldon: No, I don\u2019t drink coffee.\nPenny: Come on, but if you don\u2019t stay awake we\u2019ll never finish in time.\nSheldon: I\u2019m sorry, coffee\u2019s out of the question. When I moved to California, I promised my mother that I wouldn\u2019t start doing drugs.\nPenny: Leonard, help.\nLeonard: Sheldon, we still have 380 of these things to make.\nSheldon: I have complete faith that you will make them. Good night.\nPenny: Leonard?\nLeonard: Yeah, no. But, Sheldon, without your insight and leadership this entire enterprise will surely fail.\nSheldon: You\u2019re right, of course.\nPenny: Here, this will help.\nSheldon: Very well, but if this leads to opiates or hallucinogenics, you\u2019re going to have to answer to my mother.\nTime shift\nSheldon: Look at Planck\u2019s Constant. People say it\u2019s arbitrary. It could not be less arbitrary. If it varied even slightly, life as we know it would not exist. Bam! Now, now, let\u2019s reconsider the entire argument, but with entropy reversed and effect preceding cause, so you are thinking of a universe that\u2019s not expanding from the centre, no, it is retreating from a, from a possibility space. Bam! This is a space where we are all essentially Alice through the looking glass, standing in front the Red Queen, and we\u2019re being offered a cracker to quench our thirst. Bam! Of course, in another universe, let\u2019s call it universe prime, there\u2019s another Sheldon, let\u2019s call him Sheldon prime\u2026\nPenny: We should have let him go to bed.\nLeonard: Bam.\nTime shift\nLeonard: I can\u2019t believe we actually did it.\nHoward: 1,000 friggin\u2019 Penny Blossoms.\nPenny: I just want you guys to know I am really grateful for your help, and for every dollar I make, I\u2019m going to give you 20 cents.\nHoward: That\u2019s your entire profit margin.\nPenny: Oh. Then never mind.\nLeonard: I\u2019ll print out the shipping label. Uh-oh.\nPenny: What?\nLeonard: We got an e-mail from the East Rutherford, New Jersey, Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender Alliance. They want another thousand Penny Blossoms.\nPenny: Really?\nLeonard: One-day rush. I really need to take that off the Web site.\nPenny: Okay, well. Guess we\u2019d better get started.\nHoward: You can\u2019t be serious.\nPenny: Come on. What about the living organism of the workforce and the American spirit and Jiminy Crockett at the Alamo?\nLeonard: Davy Crockett. Jiminy Crockett was a cricket.\nPenny: Yes, yes, I know that, okay? I\u2019m tired, I\u2019ve had like 18 cups of coffee. The point is, if we all just pull together, we can do this. Who\u2019s with me?\nHoward: Penny, although you may find it hard to believe, we do have lives.\nPenny: Leonard?\nLeonard: Sorry. My apologies to the gay community of East Rutherford, New Jersey.\nSheldon (entering dressed as The Flash): Zoom, zoom, zoom! Where\u2019s the coffee?\nPenny: We\u2019re all out.\nSheldon: No problem. I\u2019ll be back before this banana hits the ground. Zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom! Zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom!\nScene: The apartment. Raj is negotiating the laser beams. Sheldon and Howard are singing dramatically. \n \nRaj (reaching the other side): Yes! (He takes a slice of pizza)\nHoward: Sorry, guys, but Secret Agent Laser Obstacle Lunch is just stupid.\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "7_21": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The apartment.\nPenny: So, we\u2019re about to shoot this scene in the movie where the killer ape DNA is slowly taking over my body.\nLeonard: Okay.\nPenny: But I realize they\u2019re gluing fur everywhere except my cleavage. So, I asked the director why and he says, it\u2019s important to the story that my boobs be the last things to turn ape.\nLeonard: It\u2019s sweet that he thinks there\u2019s a story.\nPenny: Oh, and there\u2019s not even a bathroom on set. I have to go to the gas station across the street. I mean, I was dressed like half an ape and still not even close to the most disgusting person in there.\nSheldon: Leonard, I could use your assistance.\nLeonard: Sure. What\u2019s up?\nSheldon: Well, now that I\u2019ve given up string theory, I\u2019m struggling to find my next area of focus. So, in your professional opinion, which of these areas do you think is the most promising?\nLeonard: Huh, well, I think there\u2019s some really innovative stuff going on in dark matter.\nSheldon: That\u2019s helpful. Okay. Of these four areas\u2026\nPenny: Sheldon, what did we say about being a nicer friend?\nLeonard: Thank you.\nPenny: Leonard, what did we say about being a gullible weenie?\nSheldon: It is just so frustrating.\nPenny: \u2018Cause you\u2019re trying too hard. You need to do something else, get your mind off it.\nLeonard: Hey. How about we bring back Anything Can Happen Thursdays?\nPenny: Hey, that\u2019s good. Why\u2019d you guys stop doing that?\nLeonard: You made fun of us. Said it was stupid.\nPenny: Yeah. Sounds like me. Come on, Sheldon. What do you say?\nSheldon: All right. I officially reinstate Anything Can Happen Thursday.\nLeonard: Great, what do you want to do?\nSheldon: I don\u2019t know. What do you want to do?\nPenny: I don\u2019t know. What do you want to do?\nLeonard: I\u2019m starting to remember the problem with Anything Can Happen Thursdays.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Hmm, what can we do that\u2019s fun?\nLeonard: What can we do that\u2019s different?\nPenny: What can we do that\u2019s free?\nSheldon: Oh, got it. We order a pizza.\nPenny: Are you kidding? That\u2019s what you always do. Think harder.\nSheldon: You\u2019re right. You\u2019re right. Got it. We order calzones, cut them open, eat them like pizza. All right, all right, I\u2019ll shake the brain bush one more time, see what falls out. Got it. There\u2019s a live-action role-playing group that meets every Thursday night in Griffith Park and re-enacts battles from Lord of the Rings.\nPenny: Uh, tell me more about this calzone idea.\nLeonard: You know what? Why don\u2019t we just ease into this. Let, let\u2019s go for a walk and, and, and see if we find a new restaurant.\nSheldon: Any chance that restaurant is near Griffith Park?\nLeonard: No.\nSheldon: All right.\nLeonard: Raj and Howard are at Howard\u2019s mom\u2019s, but should we call the girls and see if they want to come?\nPenny: No. Bernadette\u2019s working late.\nSheldon: Amy\u2019s sick.\nLeonard: Aw. What\u2019s wrong with her?\nSheldon: Well, she talks a lot. She always wants to hold hands.\nLeonard: That\u2019s not what I meant.\nSheldon: Well, if you were referring to her illness your question should have been, what ails her?\nLeonard: What ails her?\nSheldon: Oh. Who knows?\nPenny: Come on, anything can happen. We can push him down the stairs.\nScene: Howard\u2019s mother\u2019s house.\nHoward: Hey. Thanks for coming to hang out.\nRaj: No problem. How\u2019s your mom feeling?\nHoward: Okay, but she\u2019d feel better if she took her medicine.\nRaj: You know, when Cinnamon won\u2019t take her medicine, I hide it in a piece of cheese.\nHoward: Good idea. We can wrap the pill in cheese, feed it to Cinnamon, and then my mom can eat Cinnamon. So what do you feel like doing?\nRaj: I was thinking we could watch a DVD.\nHoward: Well, my mom doesn\u2019t have a lot to choose from. Unless you want to watch the video of her colonoscopy. Spoiler alert, 20 minutes in they find a prune pit.\nRaj: Actually, how do you feel about watching House of 1000 Corpses?\nHoward: A straight-up gore-fest? You hate this stuff.\nRaj: I do, but for some reason, Emily loves it and wants to watch it with me tomorrow, so I thought if I start with you first, then I could act cool about it with her.\nHoward: That\u2019s actually not a bad plan. I can sit through the colonoscopy now, but that first time I was like, oh my God, a prune pit.\nRaj: Uh, so, you\u2019ll watch it?\nHoward: Sure.\nRaj: You\u2019re a good friend. I owe you one.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Howard. Help me get out of the tub.\nRaj: Not that one.\nScene: The street. \nSheldon: So, we\u2019re just randomly choosing a restaurant without researching it online?\nPenny: Yep.\nSheldon: Great. You know, this is how Anything Can Happen Thursday turns into It Won\u2019t Stop Coming Up Friday.\nLeonard: Hey, how about that Asian fusion place?\nSheldon: Fusion and Asians? I\u2019m trying not to think about science.\nPenny: What the hell? What? She\u2019s not working late.\nSheldon: And Amy doesn\u2019t look sick.\nPenny: Why would they lie to us?\nSheldon: That\u2019s a good question. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy and Bernadette. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy and Bernadette. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy and Bernadette. Why did you lie to us?\nScene: Howard\u2019s mother\u2019s house.\nRaj: Hey. Listen to this. Murder, cannibalism and satanic rituals are just a few of the thousand plus horrors that await.\nHoward: I just helped my mom out of the tub, so, I\u2019m one slippery horror ahead of you.\nRaj: You\u2019re a good son. I don\u2019t know how you do it.\nHoward: Beach blankets, my friend, it\u2019s all about beach blankets.\nRaj: All right, let\u2019s get this over with. Ew, it\u2019s got someone\u2019s hair on it.\nHoward: Oh, yeah, you\u2019re gonna do great with this movie.\nScene: A bar.\nPenny: You\u2019re not working late. Why did you lie to me?\nSheldon: And Amy, you told me you were sick, but you look just as pale and tired as always.\nAmy: I\u2019m sorry, I just needed a break from hearing you obsess about what to do after string theory.\nBernadette: We kind of just wanted one night where we didn\u2019t have to hear about how miserable you are making this movie.\nAmy: But none of that means we don\u2019t love you.\nPenny: I haven\u2019t been complaining that much about the movie. Have I?\nLeonard: I also love you.\nPenny: Well you know what? Maybe I need a break from all of you. Come on, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Where are we going?\nPenny: We\u2019re gonna have Anything Can Happen Thursday, you\u2019re gonna tell me all about your science stuff and I\u2019m gonna complain about my movie, and we\u2019re gonna support each other because that\u2019s what friends do.\nSheldon: Okay. \u2018Cause if I had to pick now, I\u2019d probably go with dark matter because\u2026\nPenny: Shut up.\nScene: A restaurant. Sheldon makes an \u201cunsure\u201d noise.\nPenny: What\u2019s wrong?\nSheldon: I don\u2019t understand my food. Chinese noodles with Korean barbecue in a taco.\nPenny: It\u2019s fusion.\nSheldon: My mother would lock her car doors if she had to drive through this hodgepodge of ethnicity.\nPenny: Think I\u2019ve been complaining too much about the movie?\nSheldon: Not at all.\nPenny: Thank you.\nSheldon: But to be fair, when you talk, most of what you say sounds like, wah, wah, wah, clothes, wah, wah, wah.\nPenny: Hey, I don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re not upset with Amy.\nSheldon: I am. So much so that I\u2019m gonna bring her here for dinner on our next date night.\nScene: Howard\u2019s mother\u2019s house.\nRaj: Okay. So, in the last 20 minutes, we\u2019ve seen a crazy woman kissing a fetus in a jar. We\u2019ve seen a guy cut in half and sewn to a fish.\nHoward: And the brutal dismemberment of a rotisserie chicken by my mother.\nRaj: On the bright side, she didn\u2019t even notice the pill. Why does Emily like this stuff? Do you think there\u2019s something psychologically wrong with her?\nHoward: What difference does it make?\nRaj: What do you mean?\nHoward: Oh, come on, she could have a freezer full of ex-boyfriend\u2019s body parts and you\u2019d still go out with her.\nRaj: I do like that the ex-boyfriend\u2019s out of the picture.\nScene: The bar.\nAmy: I feel so bad about lying to Sheldon. How am I gonna make it up to him?\nBernadette: I\u2019d tell you what I do with Howard, but I don\u2019t think dressing up like a Catholic schoolgirl is gonna work with Sheldon.\nLeonard: He\u2019d probably give you homework.\nAmy: Did you lie to Howard about tonight?\nBernadette: Of course.\nAmy: And you don\u2019t feel guilty about it?\nBernadette: Between Penny\u2019s gorilla movie and Howard\u2019s gorilla mother, I had no choice.\nLeonard: Thankfully Penny and I have a relationship based on honesty. What? I don\u2019t lie to her.\nBernadette: Oh, we know you don\u2019t lie to her.\nScene: The restaurant.\nPenny: Thank you. Hey, maybe the answer to your career question is in one of these.\nSheldon: Penny, there\u2019s only one cookie with something in the middle that solves life\u2019s problems, and that\u2019s an Oreo. Or a Nutter Butter, if you\u2019re in a pinch.\nPenny: Come on, open it. I bet it says something great.\nSheldon: This is Asian fusion. For all you know, there\u2019s a tiny Chihuahua in here.\nPenny: Fine, I\u2019ll go. Hmm. People turn to you for guidance and wisdom. Yeah, that\u2019s a good one.\nSheldon: No, it\u2019s not.\nPenny: How is that not good?\nSheldon: Turn to you for wisdom? Clearly, that cookie is mocking you. You\u2019d never hear that kind of sass from a Nutter Butter.\nPenny: Uh, since you\u2019re paying for dinner, I\u2019ll let that slide. Open yours.\nSheldon: Have you ever paid for a meal?\nPenny: Not with money. Read.\nSheldon: Your warm and fun-loving nature delights those around you.\nPenny: Oh, try again.\nScene: Howard\u2019s mother\u2019s house. \nHoward: Let me get this straight. So, he kills this girl\u2019s father, cuts off the guy\u2019s face, and is wearing it as a mask while he makes out with her.\nRaj: I\u2019m just gonna say it. That\u2019s not okay. Why can\u2019t I be in a relationship with a girl who likes The Sound of Music?\nHoward: Raj, you are the girl in the relationship who likes The Sound of Music. (Phone rings) Hey, Penny. What\u2019s up? No, Bernie\u2019s working late. Really? Thanks for telling me.\nRaj: What?\nHoward: I\u2019m having sex with a Catholic schoolgirl tonight.\nScene: The street. Outside a psychic\u2019s shop.\nPenny: Oh, I think I see our next stop.\nSheldon: You can\u2019t be serious. If I wanted to waste my time on nonsense, I\u2019d follow Leonard on Instagram.\nPenny: No, come on, tonight we are trying new things.\nSheldon: Oh. That\u2019s a lot of incense. Or someone set a hippie on fire.\nScene: Outside the bar.\nBernadette (on phone): Yeah, honey, I\u2019m still stuck at work. Really? Penny said that? Okay, it\u2019s true. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ll see you at home. Yeah, yeah, I\u2019ll put it on.\nLeonard: You and I never just hang out like this. Why is that?\nAmy: I know, it\u2019s weird, right?\nLeonard: Yeah. We should do it more often.\nAmy: Oh, no. I mean, this is weird right now.\nLeonard: (Phone text sound) Ah, it\u2019s Penny.\nAmy: Is she still mad?\nLeonard: Oh, doesn\u2019t seem like it. She got Sheldon to go to a psychic with her.\nAmy: A psychic? He considers them not just mumbo jumbo, but extra-jumbo mumbo jumbo.\nLeonard: Well, Penny can be very persuasive. She\u2019s gotten me to do a lot of things I wouldn\u2019t normally do.\nAmy: Because she has sex with you.\nLeonard: Yeah, she does.\nAmy: Can I confess something? Once in a while, I get a little jealous of how close Penny and Sheldon are.\nLeonard: Really?\nAmy: I mean, not in a romantic way. It\u2019s just, she really has some sort of connection with him.\nLeonard: Well, well they\u2019ve known each other a long time, and Penny grew up around horses, so she knows how to approach him without making him skittish.\nAmy: Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m glad they\u2019re friends. I just wish he\u2019d be that comfortable around me already.\nLeonard: Well, it took him a long time to get comfortable around me, too.\nAmy: Really? What did you do?\nLeonard: Something terrible in a former life? I don\u2019t know.\nBernadette: I gotta go. Penny ratted me out. FYI, she\u2019s getting you a watch for your birthday with money she took out of your wallet.\nScene: The psychic shop.\nSheldon: I don\u2019t mean to be rude or discourteous, but before we begin, I\u2019d just like to say there is absolutely no scientific evidence to support clairvoyance of any kind. Which means, and again, no insult intended, that you\u2019re a fraud, your profession is a swindle, and, uh, your livelihood is dependent on the gullibility of stupid people. Again, no offence.\nPenny: All right, Sheldon, just ask your question.\nSheldon: Okay, I just did. What was it?\nPenny: Oh, for God\u2019s sake. Look, he\u2019s a physicist who\u2019s trying to figure out what his next field of study should be.\nSheldon: For your information, I was asking her about the next Star Trek movie.\nPenny: Okay, I can answer that one, I\u2019ll be bored.\nPsychic: All right, why don\u2019t we begin? Your spirit guides are telling me that there\u2019s a woman in your life you\u2019re having problems with.\nSheldon: That\u2019s an easy guess. I\u2019m clearly an annoying person and have problems with both genders.\nPsychic: Yes, you clearly are. But I\u2019m seeing a specific woman that you\u2019re in a romantic relationship with.\nPenny: Oh, oh, here we go.\nPsychic: Does she have dark hair?\nPenny: Yes, yes, your spirit guides are on fire.\nSheldon: The majority of people have dark hair. Even you, at one time.\nPsychic: Does she work in a similar field to you?\nSheldon: Ha. The opposite. She\u2019s a neurobiologist, and I\u2019m a theoretical physicist. My spirit guides can go suck an egg.\nPsychic: They\u2019re telling me that you have difficulty being close with her.\nPenny: Oh, he does. He so does. What should he do?\nPsychic: He should give himself to this relationship. Once he does, all his other pursuits will come into focus.\nPenny: Sheldon, do you hear that? I mean, Amy is the key to your happiness.\nPsychic: Exactly. Personally and professionally. Everything will fall into place once you commit to her.\nSheldon: You know what this is? Yeah, and I reserve this word for those rare instances when it\u2019s truly deserved. This is malarkey.\nPenny: Wow, you really struck a nerve. I\u2019ve never heard him use the M word before.\nScene: Raj\u2019s apartment.\nRaj: Here we go, House of a 1,000 Corpses.\nEmily: Now, just so you know, I was a nanny for three years, so if you get scared, I can totally change your diaper.\nRaj: Actually, I have to tell you something. These kind of movies really aren\u2019t my thing, so, last night, I watched it just to see what I was getting myself into.\nEmily: Okay.\nRaj: And I have to be honest, I thought it was disturbing and weird, and it made me wonder what it says about someone who enjoys it.\nEmily: I wonder that, too.\nRaj: Then, why do you watch these things?\nEmily: Can I tell you something without you judging me?\nRaj: Sure.\nEmily: They kind of turn me on.\nRaj: And play.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Hello. I didn\u2019t expect you this evening.\nAmy: Well, I was just feeling so bad about lying to you the other night, I wanted to make it up to you.\nSheldon: And how do you propose to do that? (Amy takes off coat and is dressed as a Catholic schoolgirl) Unless you have Gravity on Blu-ray under that skirt, I don\u2019t know where you\u2019re going with this.\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "3_6": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The stairwell. The guys are carrying kites.\nLeonard: Kites, ho!\nHoward: Kites ho!\nRaj: Kites ho!\nAll three: Kites, ho!\nSheldon: Excuse me. You\u2019re misusing the word ho. It\u2019s an interjection used to call attention to a destination, not an object, as in, uh, Land, ho! Or, uh, Westward, ho!\nThe three guys: Kites, ho!\nPenny: Hey, guys. What you doing? Going out to discover electricity?\nLeonard: If you\u2019re referring to the work of Benjamin Franklin, he did not discover electricity, he merely used a kite to determine that lightning consists of electricity. He also invented the Franklin stove, bifocals and the flexible urinary catheter. Kites, ho.\nLeonard: We\u2019re heading out for some kite fighting.\nPenny: Kite fighting?\nLeonard: Oh, yeah. It\u2019s an extremely competitive, cutthroat sport.\nSheldon: Well, actually, the risk of throat cutting is very low. On the other hand, severe string burn is a real and ever-Present danger.\nLeonard: You want to come watch?\nPenny: Oh, gee, sounds amazing, but, um, I\u2019ve got some friends coming over. Not a big thing, we\u2019re just gonna watch the Nebraska game.\nLeonard: Oh. Football, sure.\nHoward: Good guess.\nPenny: I would\u2019ve invited you, but I know you\u2019re not a football fan.\nLeonard: No, no, I\u2019m not, so, great. You\u2019ve got plans doing something you like, I\u2019ve got plans doing something I like, so it\u2019s good.\nPenny: Well, maybe we\u2019ll hang out later, you know, after everybody\u2019s gone.\nLeonard: Yeah, great.\nPenny: See ya.\nLeonard: Well, this sucks.\nSheldon: I\u2019m sorry, I got bored and drifted off. Where exactly in the interaction did the sucking lie?\nRaj: Leonard just realized that Penny\u2019s been hiding him from her friends because he\u2019s a tiny, little man who flies kites.\nSheldon: Oh, that certainly would suck.\nCredits sequence. \n \nScene: The park.\nSheldon: Wolowitz is trying to outflank us. Let out some string, add altitude and I\u2019ll go under and cut his line.\nLeonard: Why wouldn\u2019t Penny want her friends to meet me?\nSheldon: Focus, Leonard, focus! The heat of battle is upon us, the dogs of war are unleashed.\nLeonard: Maybe Koothrappali\u2019s right, maybe I embarrass her.\nSheldon: You\u2019re embarrassing me right now, a grown man worrying about such nonsense when in the middle of flying kites.\nLeonard: Sorry.\nSheldon: Sorry won\u2019t bring their kites down. Ow! String burn! String burn!\nRaj: Oh, they think we\u2019re flanking, they\u2019re playing right into our hands. On the count of three, we execute the flying scissor. One, two\u2026\nHoward: Whoa! Did you see that?\nRaj: See what?\nHoward: That chick, she smiled at me.\nRaj: No, she didn\u2019t.\nHoward: Yes, she did.\nRaj: Come on, scissors, scissors!\nHoward: Hold my line.\nRaj: Wait, what are you doing? I can\u2019t scissors by myself! Howard! Come back!\nSheldon: Victory!\nRaj: Son of a bitch.\nScene: Leonard\u2019s car.\nRaj: You\u2019re a sucky friend, you know that? A sucky, sucky friend.\nHoward: What was I supposed to do? She gave me that come-hither look.\nRaj: If she gave you any look at l. It was a you suck look.\nHoward: I would\u2019ve caught up to her if I hadn\u2019t pulled a hammy.\nRaj: Oh, please, you weigh 80 pounds. You don\u2019t have a hammy.\nLeonard: So, Penny doesn\u2019t want me around her friends, I embarrass her. What else could it be?\nSheldon: Well, her actions could be out of concern for your feelings. Perhaps she\u2019s excluded you from these gatherings because she\u2019s scouting for a new mate and doesn\u2019t want to do it in front of you.\nLeonard: Oh, how kind of her.\nSheldon: Agreed. Most primates don\u2019t show that sort of discretion. A female bonobo will copulate with a new male in front of the old one without so much as a how do you do?\nRaj: You always do this, you know? You ditch me for a woman you don\u2019t have a shot with.\nHoward: I totally had a shot.\nRaj: With a woman you were chasing through a park? That\u2019s not a shot, that\u2019s a felony. What\u2019s worse, it cost me my prized Patang fighting kite. Sheldon, I don\u2019t suppose there\u2019s any chance you could give me my kite back?\nSheldon: I\u2019m sorry, Raj, but the rules of aerial warfare dictate at the fallen kite go to the victor. And without rules, the competition has no meaning. And without meaning, the following would be an empty gesture. (Sings) I have your kite. I have your kite.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment.\nLeonard: Hey.\nPenny: Hi.\nLeonard: How was your football party?\nPenny: It was pretty good. We won.\nLeonard: Oh, that\u2019s excellent. It\u2019s a weird figure of speech, isn\u2019t it, we won when you weren\u2019t\nactually playing. When we watch Star Wars, we don\u2019t say, we defeated the Empire.\nPenny: I\u2019m glad to hear it.\nLeonard: Oh, hey, on a related subject, are you embarrassed to have me around your friends?\nPenny: Oh, my god, no. Why would you ask that?\nLeonard: Well, you know, I just noticed I haven\u2019t really met any of them.\nPenny: Sure you have.\nLeonard: Well, yeah, no, I met the huge ex-boyfriend and the smaller yet still larger than me ex-boyfriend. Were they here today?\nPenny: Of course not.\nLeonard: Of course not. Why would they be? Why would I ask? Why am I rambling? Why don\u2019t you stop me?\nPenny: Leonard, look, if you want to meet my friends, that would be great. I just, you know, I didn\u2019t want you to be bored.\nLeonard: I wouldn\u2019t be bored. Why would I be bored?\nPenny: Well, \u2019cause they\u2019re not genius scientists.\nLeonard: Penny, I like all sorts of people. In fact, some of my best friends aren\u2019t geniuses.\nPenny: Like who?\nLeonard: Okay, some of my Facebook friends aren\u2019t geniuses. My point is, if we\u2019re going to be a couple, I should be friends with your friends.\nPenny: Okay, great. Well, then why don\u2019t you come over next Saturday and watch the game with us.\nLeonard: Another football game?\nPenny: They have them every week.\nLeonard: Did not know that.\nPenny: You wanted to meet my friends.\nLeonard: Sure, sure, just I don\u2019t know much about football.\nPenny: Oh, that\u2019s okay, a lot of the guys\u2019 girlfriends don\u2019t know football. They just kind of drink and talk in the kitchen.\nLeonard: Great.\nScene: The apartment. Leonard and Raj are watching a football game on the television. \nLeonard: Okay, a complete pass. First down, New England. I think I\u2019m starting to get this.\nRaj: Really? The only thing I\u2019ve learned in the last two hours is that American men love drinking beer, pee too often and have trouble getting erections.\nLeonard: Focus on the game, not the commercials, Raj.\nRaj: I\u2019m just saying, maybe if you people cut back on the beer, you could get out of the bathroom and satisfy your women without pharmaceutical help.\nHoward (arriving): Raj, what are you doing here? You were supposed to help me pimp out my Vespa.\nRaj: I\u2019m sorry, are you under the impression that we\u2019re still friends?\nHoward: Oh come on, you\u2019re not still grinding on the kite thing, are you?\nRaj: It\u2019s not just the kite thing. Every time we go some place, you think you can just dump me whenever someone prettier comes along, even though you don\u2019t have a shot with them.\nHoward: But I had a shot with that jogger.\nRaj: Fine. Paint green flames on your little scooter with her. (Leaves)\nHoward: It\u2019s not a little scooter. It\u2019s the second biggest Vespa they make! Are you watching football?\nLeonard: There\u2019s no fooling you. Now, what is this sacks statistic they put up there?\nHoward: All I know about Saks is, my mother shops there.\nLeonard: Sacks, sacks\u2026\nSheldon: It\u2019s football nomenclature for when a quarterback is tackled behind the line of scrimmage.\nLeonard: Huh\u2026 Scrimmage\u2026\nSheldon: The line of scrimmage is the imaginary transverse line separating the offence from the defence.\nLeonard: Oh.\nHoward: Sheldon knows football?\nLeonard: Apparently.\nHoward: I mean, Quidditch, sure. But football?\nLeonard: Sheldon, how do you know this stuff?\nSheldon: I grew up in Texas. Football is ubiquitous in Texas. Pro football, college football, high school football, peewee football, in fact, every form of football except the original, European football, which most Texans believe to be a Commie plot.\nLeonard: Unbelievable.\nSheldon: If you\u2019re interested, I also know all about frying meat that isn\u2019t chicken as if it were chicken.\nLeonard: So you could teach me?\nSheldon: Football or chicken-fried meats?\nLeonard: Football. I\u2019m going to Penny\u2019s on Saturday to watch a game with her friends and I don\u2019t want to look like an idiot. I want to blend in.\nSheldon: If you want to blend in with Penny\u2019s friends, I\u2019d think looking like an idiot would be the perfect camouflage.\nLeonard: Come on, Sheldon, please teach me about football. It\u2019ll be fun.\nSheldon: That\u2019s exactly what my father said. Come to the games, watch the games, week in and week out from the time I was five until I went off to college. Longest seven years of my life.\nLeonard: Please, I\u2019m asking you as a friend.\nSheldon: Are you making this a tier one friendship request?\nLeonard: Yes.\nSheldon: Fine.\nLeonard: I really appreciate this.\nSheldon: Yeah, yeah. All right, Poindexter, sit down, shut up and listen.\nLeonard: I\u2019m sorry?\nSheldon: That\u2019s how my father always began our football conversations. And if you\u2019d like, after the game, I\u2019ll take you outside and teach you how to shoot close enough to a racoon that it craps itself.\nScene: The kitchen. Sheldon is making toast in a cylon toaster which burns an image of a cylon onto the toast. \n \nLeonard: When are you going to stop making Cylon toast?\nSheldon: When I have enough to destroy all the human toast on the battlestar known as Galactica. Is that what you\u2019re wearing to watch football at Penny\u2019s?\nLeonard: What\u2019s wrong with a football jersey?\nSheldon: Nothing. That, however, appears to be a football cocktail dress.\nLeonard: I\u2019s the smallest size they had, except the one for dogs. I can\u2019t believe they had one for dogs.\nSheldon: Oh, yes. Canine football fans are a common sight in Texas. Cats, however, refuse to wear sporting apparel. My sister found that out the hard way.\nLeonard: Anyway, wish me luck.\nSheldon: Leonard, wait. Am I correct in assuming that your attempt to be accepted by Penny\u2019s peers is based on your desire to ensure your continuing mating privileges with her?\nLeonard: Well, I wouldn\u2019t put it exactly that way.\nSheldon: How would you put it?\nLeonard: Yeah, okay, like you said.\nSheldon: Huh. Seems like an awful lot of trouble to go through for intercourse. Don\u2019t you have access to women who will do it for money? By the way, another accepted usage for the term ho.\nLeonard: Good-Bye, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Hold on I believe that social convention dictate you not arrive empty-Handed. Would you like to bring some Cylon toast?\nLeonard: Yeah, no, I\u2019m trying to fit in, not get laughed at.\nSheldon: What\u2019s funny about Cylon toast?\nScene: Raj\u2019s apartment. Raj is watching a Bollywood movie. There is a knock on the door.\nRaj: It\u2019s open.\nHoward: Hey, pal.\nRaj: What do you want?\nHoward: I brought you a little gift. New kite.\nRaj: The kite you made me lose was an authentic Patang, an Indian fighting kite that my brother sent to me from New Delhi. It took me a day to put together and two days to paint. This is Hello Kitty.\nHoward: Yeah, but it comes with a little coin purse. Does a Patang?\nRaj: Wow, you just don\u2019t get it, do you? Buying me something pretty isn\u2019t going to make our problem just go away.\nHoward: Look, I admit I haven\u2019t always been the best friend I could be.\nRaj: You\u2019ve been a sucky friend, a sucky, sucky friend.\nHoward: Stipulated.\nRaj: And you do it all the time. Last week in the mall at Radio Shack, we were looking for a phone with giant numbers for your mother, and I suddenly realize you\u2019re not even there.\nHoward: I know, I know.\nRaj: And where were you?\nHoward: Getting shot down by the girl at Hot Dog on a Stick. But in my defence, she was gorgeous, and working that squeezer to make the lemonade, going up and down and up and down. It was like a free pole dance right in the middle of the food court.\nRaj: You\u2019re impossible.\nHoward: Hey, at least I can talk to women without being drunk.\nRaj: Excuse me, I have selective mutism, a recognized medical disorder. You\u2019re just a douche.\nHoward: No. You know what? Maybe that\u2019s what this whole thing\u2019s about. You\u2019re not mad at me, you\u2019re mad at yourself.\nRaj: No, I\u2019m mad at you. I hate myself, but I\u2019m mad at you.\nHoward: Fine. You\u2019re mad at me. I get it. Now, how about we go spend the day together? Just the two of us. We\u2019ll go anywhere you want.\nRaj: I don\u2019t know.\nHoward: Come on. Let me take you someplace nice.\nRaj: I\u2026 I do enjoy the La Brea Tar Pits.\nHoward: Really, now? With the traffic and the parking, it\u2019s\u2026 okay, fine. The Tar Pits. Let\u2019s go.\nRaj: Oh, why can\u2019t I stay mad at you?\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment. Everyone is watching football.\nLeonard: Go! Go! Go! Go-Go-Go-Go! Yes! Are you people watching this? Is this amazing or what?\nPenny: Sweetie, that\u2019s a highlight from the \u201998 championship game.\nLeonard: Oh. Did not know that.\nPenny: How much beer have you had?\nLeonard: None, why?\nPenny: Oh. I was just kind of hoping you were drunk. Now we\u2019re back live.\nLeonard: Okay, yeah. I can see the difference.\nGuy in baseball hat: Oh, where\u2019s the flag, that\u2019s intentional grounding.\nSecond guy: Totally.\nLeonard: That completely was a forward pass, which they threw intentionally incomplete to avoid loss of yardage or to conserve time. I can\u2019t believe they\u2019re not being penalized with the loss of a down and by having to move the line of scrimmage back to the spot of the foul.\nPenny: Here, have some pizza, sweetie.\nLeonard: Penny, you know I\u2019m lactose intolerant.\nPenny: I know. I just need you stop talking.\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny.\nPenny: Sheldon, come in.\nSheldon: Thank you. I\u2019d like to make a sandwich, but I\u2019m out of bread.\nPenny: There\u2019s some in the fridge.\nSheldon: You shouldn\u2019t keep your bread in the refrigerator. Staleness is caused by crystallization of the starch molecules, which occurs faster at cool temperatures.\nPenny: On Earth, we say thank you.\nSheldon: So Leonard, how goes the mimesis?\nLeonard: Mimesis?\nSheldon: You know. Mimesis. An action in which the mimic takes on the properties of a specific object or organism. Mimesis.\nLeonard: What the hell are you talking about?\nSheldon: I\u2019m attempting to communicate with you without my meaning becoming apparent to those around you. Let me try again. Have the indigenous fauna accepted you as one of their own? Nudge, nudge, wink, wink.\nLeonard: Oh, I guess so.\nSheldon: Good. Oh, FYI. After I eat my sandwich, I\u2019m taking Koothrappali\u2019s Patang kite out for a test run. Would you like to get your delta-wing raptor and join me?\nLeonard: I don\u2019t want to fly kites, Sheldon. We\u2019re watching football here.\nSheldon: I can see that. I was providing you with an alternative. A courtesy I was never offered in similar circumstances.\nLeonard: Oh, look at that. The Oklahoma coach has thrown down a red flag indicating he\u2019s challenging the ruling on the field. I hope he\u2019s right, \u2019cause if he\u2019s not, it\u2019ll cost him one of his three time-Outs.\nPenny: You know, Leonard, honey, I wouldn\u2019t mind if you wanted to go fly kites with Sheldon.\nLeonard: No, I\u2019ll watch the end of the game. Besides, there\u2019s only three minutes left.\nPenny: Until half time.\nLeonard: This is just half? We\u2019ve been here for hours.\nPenny: And you\u2019re gonna be here for a couple more.\nLeonard: Oh, you\u2019re kidding me.\nPenny: No.\nLeonard: Nice meeting all of you.\nPenny: So, yeah, anyway, that\u2019s my boyfriend. He is really smart.\nScene: The Le Brea Tar Pits.\nRaj: I really like my saber-toothed cat. Thank you.\nHoward: My pleasure. Maybe after lunch, we can go to Marie Callender\u2019s and have some pie.\nRaj: I\u2019d like that. This is turning out to be a perfect Saturday.\nHoward: Good. I\u2019m glad. Oh, man. Did you see the way she smiled at me?\nRaj: Fine. Go ahead.\nHoward: No. This is our day.\nRaj: If you want to chase after her, chase after her.\nHoward: Ah, who am I kidding? I wouldn\u2019t have a shot with a girl like that.\nRaj: Don\u2019t put yourself down. You\u2019re a very attractive man.\nHoward: You think so?\nRaj: Yeah. Absolutely. It wouldn\u2019t kill you to take a Pilates class with me now and then, but you have a certain wiry appeal.\nHoward: Yeah, well, it doesn\u2019t matter \u2018cause she wasn\u2019t really smiling at me.\nRaj: Actually, in this case, I think she was.\nHoward: Really?\nRaj: Yeah.\nHoward: Bye.\nRaj: What a douche.\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "9_11": "\n\t\t\t\tCaption: A short time ago in an apartment in Pasadena\u2026.\nCaption: THE BIG BANG THEORY\nCaption: EPISODE 194 \nCaption: THE OPENING NIGHT EXCITATION\nCaption: It is a period of great tension. Our heroes, Leonard, Sheldon, Wolowitz and Koothrappali know that tickets to the new Star Wars movie are about to be available for pre-sale. \nCaption: If they fail in their mission and can\u2019t see it on opening night Sheldon has sworn that they will never hear the end of it for the rest of their lives\u2026\nCaption: They believe him.\nScene: The apartment. \nLeonard: Guys, tickets already went on sale.\nSheldon: What?\nHoward: They\u2019re not supposed to be available yet.\nLeonard: I don\u2019t know what to tell you, but they\u2019re on sale.\nRaj: Wait. You\u2019re sure they\u2019re Star Wars tickets?\nLeonard: No, it\u2019s Steel Magnolias 2: Even Steelier.\nSheldon: The Web site\u2019s frozen. I can\u2019t get in.\nLeonard: Yeah, me, too.\nHoward: Same here!\nRaj: Guys, they\u2019re gonna sell out.\nHoward: What are we gonna do?!\nSheldon: All right, this goes against everything I stand for, but desperate times call for desperate measures. Lord, this is Sheldon Cooper. You\u2019re good friends with my mom. I know I\u2019ve spent my life denying that you exist.\nHoward: Got \u2019em.\nSheldon: And I will continue to do so!\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The apartment.\nPenny: I\u2019m really happy you and Amy are back together.\nSheldon: Oh, thank you.\nLeonard: I\u2019m also really happy, but I can\u2019t pretend it\u2019s for you. New Star Wars in three days.\nSheldon: Hey, Thursday can\u2019t get here soon enough. I\u2019m taking off work to watch the original trilogy while I eat enough Star Wars cereal to choke a Wookiee.\nPenny: Uh, sweetie, you do realize Thursday is Amy\u2019s birthday.\nSheldon: And you do realize I bought my ticket when Amy and I were broken up? I hope you didn\u2019t need anything in that case, \u2019cause it\u2019s closed.\nPenny: You guys just got back together. You might not want to ditch her on her birthday.\nLeonard: I think Penny has a point. You can see it another day.\nSheldon: But someone might spoil the movie. No one can spoil Amy\u2019s birthday for me. Surprise, she\u2019s even older. Who saw that coming?\nPenny: Aw, that\u2019s nice. Put that on her cake.\nScene: Sheldon\u2019s bedroom.\nArthur: Oh, great. This again.\nSheldon: Arthur, what brings you back?\nArthur: Uh, beats me. I, I just hope this isn\u2019t a, a sex dream.\nSheldon: In the past, you\u2019ve come to me when I\u2019m struggling with a dilemma.\nArthur: And, and the one time where, where you were afraid, and you needed me for, for a night light. What\u2019s, what\u2019s troubling you?\nSheldon: Well, my friends are telling me I shouldn\u2019t abandon my girlfriend on her birthday to see the new Star Wars movie.\nArthur: Well, sounds right. Can, can I get out of this muumuu now?\nSheldon: Those are the robes of the Jedi, the guardians of peace and justice in the galaxy.\nArthur: And they, they, they don\u2019t wear underwear.\nSheldon: So, you agree with my friends that I should skip the premiere?\nArthur: Uh, do, do you love this girl?\nSheldon: Yes. But she knows how important Star Wars is to me.\nArthur: Well, maybe you should show her how, how important she is to you.\nSheldon: By seeing the movie she\u2019d want me to see?\nArthur: Sheldon, you, you can see this movie whenever you want. But you only have a limited number of days that you, you can be with this woman. Be with her.\nSheldon: You\u2019re right.\nArthur: Great.\nSheldon: Where are you going?\nArthur: I don\u2019t know, but hopefully, somewhere I can wear pants.\nScene: Amy\u2019s bedroom. \nAmy (answering phone): Sheldon, what\u2019s wrong?\nSheldon: I wanted to let you know I\u2019ll be spending your birthday with you.\nAmy: Okay.\nSheldon: See, I, I had tickets to the Star Wars premiere that night, but Professor Proton came to me in a dream dressed as Obi-Wan Kenobi and convinced me I should be with you.\nAmy: Obi-what?\nSheldon: I\u2019ll, I\u2019ll let you get back to sleep now. Good night.\nAmy: Okay. Good night. Wait. Um, Sheldon, were you actually not gonna spend my birthday with me?\nSheldon: It\u2019s late. Got to go. Bye.\nScene: The apartment. \nRaj: Good for Sheldon deciding to stay with Amy on her birthday.\nLeonard: I know. It\u2019s still gonna be weird to see the movie without him.\nHoward: Well, we could wait a couple days and see it together. (all laugh) \nSheldon: Hello.\nLeonard: Hey. We\u2019re going to the comic book store. You want to come?\nSheldon: No, I can\u2019t. I need to make preparations for Amy\u2019s birthday. Which leads me to the following bit of business. This is my ticket to Star Wars. I don\u2019t have to tell you it is worth far more than its face value of fifteen dollars and fifty cents. I trust you\u2019ll give it to someone worthy.\nLeonard: You got it. Well, Penny might want to join us.\nSheldon (to Howard): This is my ticket to Star Wars\u2026.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment.\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny.\nBernadette: What happens if I say, come in?\nPenny: Well, find out.\nBernadette: Come in.\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Bernadette. (Knock, knock, knock) Bernadette. (Knock, knock, knock) Bernadette.\nPenny: Come in.\nSheldon: Keep it up. I got nowhere else to be.\nBernadette: Just come in.\nSheldon: For future reference, if I want to watch Mean Girls, I\u2019ll stream it on Netflix.\nPenny: We\u2019re sorry. What do you need?\nSheldon: Well, as you know, I\u2019ll be celebrating Amy\u2019s birthday with her, and I could use your assistance in helping me select the perfect gift.\nBernadette: Sure.\nSheldon: Well, so far, I\u2019ve come up with three ideas. The first is a chance for her to play the harp with the L.A. Philharmonic.\nPenny: Wow. You can really arrange that?\nSheldon: Well, I said a chance, you know. When you tell them it\u2019s your birthday at Bennigan\u2019s, they make a fuss. I don\u2019t see why the Philharmonic would be any different.\nBernadette: How about something a little more realistic?\nSheldon: Well, Amy enjoys knitting her own sweaters, so I was thinking of getting her an all-expense-paid trip to the Wisconsin Sheep and Wool Festival.\nPenny: Sorry. I was waiting for the bazinga.\nBernadette: Hold on. It could be romantic. The two of them away together, keeping each other warm in snowy Wisconsin.\nSheldon: No, no, no, no. She\u2019d be going alone. Well, if you think I\u2019m afraid of birds, you should see me around sheep.\nPenny: Okay, well, what\u2019s the third option?\nSheldon: That I have coitus with her.\nScene: The comic book store. \nLeonard: What do you think about giving Sheldon\u2019s ticket to Stuart?\nRaj: I don\u2019t know. Have you ever seen a movie with Stuart before?\nHoward: It\u2019s like going with your grandpa. Instead of eating popcorn, he brings little pieces of chicken in Tupperware and a thermos full of soup.\nLeonard: He\u2019s not that bad. Hey, Stuart, got any plans Thursday night?\nStuart: My, uh, my doctor\u2019s worried about my circulation, so I was thinking about walking around the mall. Why?\nLeonard: Well\u2026\nWil Wheaton: Hey, you guys.\nHoward: Oh, make sure to wear sensible shoes. Wil, want to go to Star Wars Thursday?\nWil: Absolutely.\nStuart: Fine, take Wil. See if he brings you clam chowder.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment. \nPenny: Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. Let\u2019s, let\u2019s, let\u2019s just recap our options. All right, we\u2019ve got harp thing, sheep thing.\nBernadette: Wild thang.\nSheldon: Which do you think she\u2019d prefer? Because I checked the Sheep and Wool Festival Web site, and there\u2019s only 8,000 tickets left.\nPenny: Sheldon, being physical with Amy is a huge step for you.\nBernadette: Yeah, are you ready for this?\nSheldon: Intimacy in any form has been challenging for me, but I\u2019d like to show her how important she is, and it feels like now might be the right time.\nPenny: Sheldon, that\u2019s so beautiful.\nSheldon: Then it\u2019s settled. Amy\u2019s birthday present will be my genitals.\nScene: The stairwell. \nAmy: Thanks for taking me out.\nPenny: Well, you\u2019re spending your birthday with Sheldon. Why not celebrate early?\nBernadette: So where do you want to go?\nAmy: I heard that new Mexican place on Green Street is good.\nPenny: Sure, sure. Or we could take you to get a bikini wax.\nAmy: Why would I get a bikini wax for my birthday?\nPenny: Uh, I don\u2019t know. It was just a thought.\nAmy: I think I\u2019ll just stick to Mexican.\nBernadette: Great. And then maybe after, we can watch a dirty movie, and if anybody has any questions about what happened or how, we can answer them.\nAmy: Okay, what is going on?\nPenny: Oh, we just want you to be prepared for any surprises that might happen tomorrow.\nAmy: What surprises?\nBernadette: We don\u2019t want to spoil anything, but you should know that Sheldon said he\u2019s ready to be physical.\nAmy: You shut your damn mouth. You actually heard him say this?\nPenny: Yes. He said he wants to do something to show you how much you mean to him.\nAmy: I, I can\u2019t believe it. I, I don\u2019t know what to say.\nBernadette: Well, we\u2019re really happy for you, and we know how much he cares\u2026\nAmy: I do know what to say. Let\u2019s get me waxed.\nScene: Sheldon\u2019s bedroom.\nArthur: Why isn\u2019t it ever Angie Dickinson\u2019s bedroom?\nSheldon: You\u2019re back.\nArthur: It, it doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s up to me.\nSheldon: I suppose you\u2019re here because I\u2019ve decided to be physical with my girlfriend, and I\u2019ve never done that before.\nArthur: Eh, excuse me for a moment. Well, it was worth a shot.\nSheldon: So, can you help me?\nArthur: Uh, all right. Um, once, once the man gets the, the woman out of her, out of her bloomers\u2026\nSheldon: Oh, no. Not that. I, I understand the mechanics.\nArthur: Oh, good, good. \u2018Cause, uh, I have no idea what kids these days are calling their, their parts.\nSheldon: I think they say junk.\nArthur: What is happening to this world? What, what do you actually need to know?\nSheldon: This is an important night for us, and I\u2019m worried I might be overwhelmed and ruin everything.\nArthur: Sheldon, if, if you\u2019re with the right person, it, it\u2019ll be okay.\nSheldon: Thank you, Arthur. You are the wisest of the wise.\nArthur: Well, that\u2019s, that\u2019s very nice of you to say, but I think I\u2019m just an expression of, of your unconscious mind.\nSheldon: Oh, sure. Well, you\u2019re fun to look at.\nScene: The apartment.\nRaj: Tonight\u2019s the night.\nLeonard: Yeah, the wait is finally over.\nPenny: I know. Then you\u2019ll finally stop talking about it.\nHoward: Ready to go?\nRaj: Let\u2019s do this.\nPenny: Have fun, guys.\nLeonard: We will.\nRaj: I can\u2019t believe Sheldon gave this up.\nHoward: I know.\nLeonard: We\u2019re gonna have so much more fun than him.\nBernadette: No, they\u2019re not.\nPenny: Knowing them, they will.\nScene: The cinema.\nHoward: T minus 15 minutes.\nRaj: Oh, did you hear from Wil?\nLeonard: Yeah, he\u2019s on his way. Time for bladder check.\nRaj: Check.\nLeonard: Check.\nHoward: Check. Wait. Screw it. I\u2019m holding it.\nRaj: What is everyone booing at?\nWil: Hey, guys. What\u2019s up?\nLeonard: Um, hey, Wil. What you doin\u2019?\nWil: I was on Star Trek. Just rooting for the home team.\nMan: Star Trek stinks!\nWil: Yeah? Live long and suck it.\nScene: Amy\u2019s apartment. \nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Birthday girl. (Knock, knock, knock) Birthday girl. (Knock, knock, knock) Birthday girl.\nAmy: Come in.\nSheldon: Oh.\nAmy: Hi, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Hello. Sorry I\u2019m late. I also got you a balloon, but it floated away, and I chased it for a while.\nAmy: That\u2019s okay. Come on in. Thank you. Um, I\u2019ll, I\u2019m gonna go put these in water.\nSheldon: Okay. Ooh, this is different, hmm? Candles and music.\nAmy: Do you like it?\nSheldon: It\u2019s kind of spooky.\nAmy: I can change it back.\nSheldon: No, no, no. It\u2019s your birthday. As long as no one jumps out in a hockey mask, I\u2019ll be fine.\nAmy: So, what\u2019d you have in mind for tonight?\nSheldon: I thought I could take you out to a nice birthday dinner. If we pick a place east of here, we might find the balloon.\nAmy: Um, that sounds nice, but I\u2019m not really hungry right now. I thought maybe we could do presents first.\nSheldon: Oh. All right. Um. I should probably tell you something about this gift.\nAmy: You mean before you give it to me?\nSheldon: Yes. May I ask you a question before I give it to you?\nAmy: Of course.\nSheldon: Why are we saying give it to you like that?\nAmy: Sheldon, I know your present is for us to be intimate tonight.\nSheldon: I see. Is that all right? I\u2019m sorry, but this is a litigious society. I\u2019m gonna need verbal consent.\nAmy: Yes.\nSheldon: You know what, let me pull a quick contract off the Internet.\nScene: The cinema. \nLeonard: So, if you don\u2019t like Star Wars, why are you here?\nWil: Oh, I\u2019m just having fun. Everyone takes Star Wars so seriously. Like if the movie\u2019s bad, it\u2019s gonna ruin their lives.\nRaj: Is it bad? Did you hear something? Oh, my God. It\u2019s bad. Somebody kill me.\nWil: See? That\u2019s what I mean. When you wake up in the morning, whether this is the greatest movie ever or a total piece of crap, your life isn\u2019t gonna change at all.\nHoward: He\u2019s right.\nLeonard: Yeah. No matter what happens, we\u2019re coming back tomorrow to watch it again.\nScene: The apartment.\nBernadette: Do you think Sheldon\u2019s actually gonna go through with it?\nPenny: I don\u2019t know. He said he\u2019s ready.\nBernadette: Yeah, but he also swore this was the year he\u2019d be able to pull the guts out of a pumpkin.\nPenny: Well, I\u2019m gonna stay positive. I mean, we talked, I told him what women like, and after he stopped giggling, he seemed pretty sure of himself.\nScene: Amy\u2019s bedroom.\nAmy: Hi.\nSheldon: Hello.\nAmy: So, um, should I get under the covers with you?\nSheldon: All right. Hello.\nAmy: Hi.\nSheldon: Why are you shaking? Are you cold?\nAmy: I\u2019m just, um, really nervous.\nSheldon: Why?\nAmy: Well, I\u2019ve been waiting for this for so long, I\u2019ve just built it up in my head. I don\u2019t know what to expect.\nSheldon: Neither do I. But we can find out together.\nAmy: Okay.\nScene: The cinema. \nLeonard: I\u2019m really nervous.\nHoward: I know. We\u2019ve been waiting so long for this.\nRaj: And we\u2019ve built it up in our heads so much.\nWil: Guys, it\u2019s just a movie.\nLeonard: That\u2019s true.\nHoward: He\u2019s right.\nRaj: It is.\nWil: Although, we all remember Jar Jar.\nRaj: Leonard, I, I\u2019m scared again.\nCaption: A few hours later, in a bedroom not far away\u2026.\nSheldon: Well, I enjoyed that more than I thought I would.\nAmy: Me, too.\nSheldon: I look forward to your next birthday when we do it again.\nAmy: That works for me.\nScene: The cinema.\nWil: I enjoyed that more than I thought I would.\nRaj: I don\u2019t think I can walk right now.\nScene: Sheldon\u2019s bedroom.\nArthur: Uh, Sheldon? Sheldon?\nSheldon: Arthur. What are you doing here? I, I don\u2019t think I need any more advice.\nArthur: I, I was just curious. How, how\u2019d it go?\nSheldon: Oh. It was amazing. I, I saw it a few days later. What a movie.\nArthur: But, uh, what, what about Amy?\nSheldon: Oh. Uh, uh, she liked it fine. But she doesn\u2019t have the history with the franchise I do.\nArthur: Okay. Good, good talk.\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "4_8": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The apartment.\nPenny: Okay, help me out here. How does an archaeology professor get that good with a whip?\nHoward: Maybe he took a class at the adult bookstore. That\u2019s how I learned.\nLeonard: I can\u2019t believe you\u2019ve never seen Raiders of the Lost Ark.\nPenny: And I can\u2019t believe you\u2019ve never read Eat, Pray, Love.\nLeonard: When she comes out with Eat, Pray, Run Away From A Giant Boulder, I\u2019ll read it.\nHoward (after Raj whispers to him): I don\u2019t care if Eat, Pray, Love changed your life, I\u2019m not reading it.\nPenny: You know, I could totally rock a hat like that.\nSheldon: That\u2019s the work of noted Hollywood costume designer Deborah Nadoolman. She also designed the iconic red and black jacket in Michael Jackson\u2019s Thriller video, which I\u2019ve never viewed in its entirety, as I find zombies dancing in choreographed synchronicity implausible. And also, it\u2019s really scary.\nLeonard: Would someone please turn off the Sheldon commentary track?\nSheldon: There\u2019s no switch. Just listen and learn.\nHoward: Penny, if you think this is good, you should come with us Friday to see it on the big screen at the Colonial.\nPenny: Well, I\u2019m watching it now. Why would I want to see it again on Friday?\nSheldon: Because the print they\u2019re showing on Friday has an additional 21 seconds of previously unseen footage.\nPenny: What, 21 seconds? That\u2019ll be like seeing a whole new movie!\nLeonard: Exactly. They say it finally solves the submarine controversy.\nSheldon: Did Leonard? I\u2019m no expert, but I believe what we just heard from Penny was sarcasm. (She indicates it was) Oh, good. I\u2019m eight for 26 this month.\nPenny: Yeah, I think I\u2019ll pass. But you guys enjoy your extra 21 seconds.\nLeonard: Bet if I could make you understand why this is such a cool thing, we\u2019d still be together.\nPenny: Mm, yeah, no, we wouldn\u2019t.\nHoward: Uh-huh. I\u2019m guessing 21 seconds had something to do with that, too.\nCredits sequence. \n \nScene: The Cheesecake Factory.\nSheldon: May I point out to you all that the screening is first come, first served?\nLeonard: Relax, it\u2019s five o\u2019clock. The movie doesn\u2019t start till midnight.\nSheldon: Another way of saying that is the movie starts at midnight, and it\u2019s already five o\u2019clock. Let\u2019s go.\nHoward: You know, if we miss it, we\u2019ll have the fun of listening to Sheldon whine about it for the rest of our lives.\nSheldon: See? Howard\u2019s on my side.\nHoward: Actually, I\u2019m not. I\u2019m using sarcasm to mock you.\nSheldon: Drat. Now I\u2019m 8 for 27.\nLeonard: Don\u2019t worry, Sheldon. We\u2019ll be fine.\nSheldon: What happened to the Leonard Hofstadter who waited in line with me for 14 hours to see the midnight premiere of Star Trek: Nemesis?\nLeonard: Oh. Well, he waited in line for 14 hours, while you napped in a lawn chair, he got in a fight with a Klingon when he stepped out of line to pee and you wouldn\u2019t wake up to vouch for him, and worst of all, he saw Star Trek: Nemesis.\nSheldon: But how were our seats?\nLeonard: Excellent.\nSheldon: I rest my case. Amy, don\u2019t you agree we should leave now and get in line?\nAmy: Actually, as the newest member of your social group, I believe I\u2019ll gain more acceptance by arbitrarily siding with your friends from time to time.\nSheldon: Shrewd.\nAmy: Leonard, you\u2019re right. We should enjoy our meal, arrive late, and risk winding up with terrible seats, assuming we get in at all.\nLeonard: Thank you, Amy.\nAmy: See? It\u2019s working.\nBernadette: Knock-knock.\nHoward: Who\u2019s there?\nBernadette: Olive.\nHoward: Olive you, too.\nLeonard: Guys, that\u2019s really starting to get old.\nHoward: Knock-knock.\nLeonard: Who\u2019s there?\nHoward: I have a girlfriend and you don\u2019t.\nLeonard: Hysterical!\nSheldon: Wait, now, we don\u2019t know that yet. He isn\u2019t finished. I have a girlfriend and you don\u2019t who?\nHoward: So. Are you sure you don\u2019t want to come with us to Raiders?\nBernadette: Oh, no. That movie has melting faces. It reminds me too much of the time I dropped that vial of flesh-eating bacteria into the Rhesus monkey lab. Besides, Penny and I are having a girls\u2019 night tonight.\nAmy: Girls\u2019 night? What does that entail?\nBernadette: Oh, you know, girls get together, hang out, share girl talk.\nAmy: I\u2019m a girl.\nBernadette: Oh. Well, maybe you can join us. I\u2019ll ask Penny.\nAmy: No need. Penny and I are very close.\nBernadette: You are?\nAmy: Yes. In fact, our menses are synchronized. Penny. Bernadette tells me you\u2019re planning a girls\u2019 night.\nPenny: Yeah?\nAmy: I\u2019m a girl.\nPenny: Oh. Um, it was, it was just going to be me and Bernadette. Besides, I thought you were going to the movies with Sheldon and the guys.\nAmy: Yes, but they\u2019re not girls. I\u2019m a girl.\nPenny: Yeah, no, no, I-I-I got that.\nAmy: What\u2019s the dress code?\nPenny: Uh, just wear something comfortable.\nAmy: All right. I\u2019ll have to go shopping.\nSheldon: Knock-knock.\nLeonard: Who\u2018s there?\nSheldon: Hugh.\nLeonard: Hugh who?\nSheldon: Hugh people need to listen to me. It\u2019s time to get in line for the movie. And that\u2019s how you tell a knock-knock joke.\nScene: The movie theatre. The line is incredibly long.\nSheldon: Under normal circumstances I\u2019d say, I told you so. But as I have told you so with such vehemence and frequency already, the phrase has lost all meaning. Therefore, I will be replacing it with the phrase I informed you thusly.\nHoward: Ooh. Can\u2019t wait for that to start.\nSheldon: I informed you thusly.\nRaj: Eight for 28.\nSheldon: This is where we could have been if we hadn\u2019t stopped for dinner. This is where we could have been if Koothrappali hadn\u2019t ordered dessert.\nRaj: Well I earned it, dude, I ate all my broccoli.\nSheldon: And here\u2019s where we are. The runts in a large litter, unlikely to ever reach the nourishing teats of Indiana Jones.\nLeonard: So I guess it\u2019s a good thing we stopped for dinner.\nRaj: You know, guys, when facing disappointment, Eat, Pray, Love teaches us\u2013\nHoward: Oh, shut up.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment.\nAmy: So anyway, to make a long story short, turns out I have an unusually firm cervix.\nPenny: You know Amy, when we say girl talk, it doesn\u2019t just have to be about our lady parts.\nAmy: Shame. \u2018Cause I have a real zinger about my titled uterus.\nBernadette: Penny, your nails look great.\nPenny: Oh, thanks. I found this place in Alhambra. It\u2019s in a woman\u2019s basement. I think it\u2019s a front\nfor human trafficking, but they do a really good job.\nAmy: A colleague of mine did her graduate thesis on the fungus that grows on improperly sterilized manicure implements. Well don\u2019t tell me that\u2019s not girl talk.\nPenny: So where should we go tonight? A bar? A club? A movie?\nBernadette: Or we could just stay here.\nAmy: Yes, and continue to bond. I have a feeling that after tonight, one of you will become my best friend forever. Or BFF, if you prefer. Which I don\u2019t.\nPenny: All right, time to open Bachelor Number Two.\nBernadette: Gee, I don\u2019t know if I should drink more. I have to drive home, and I\u2019ve got enough trouble seeing over the dashboard as it is.\nPenny: That\u2019s okay. Y ou can just sleep here.\nAmy: Oh, good, a slumber party! We\u2019ll do makeovers, initiate phony phone calls, and have spirited pillow fights in our frilly nighties!\nPenny: Oh, gosh, Amy. I don\u2019t know if I would call this an actual slumber party.\nAmy: Well, that\u2019s disappointing. I\u2019ve always wanted to be invited to a slumber party.\nBernadette: Oh, you never were?\nPenny: Not even when you were a kid?\nAmy: Well, there was the time I had my tonsils out, and I shared a room with a little Vietnamese girl. She didn\u2019t make it through the night, but up till then, it was kind of fun.\nPenny: Okay. Well, I guess we\u2019re having a slumber party. Oh!\nAmy: Pillow fight!\nScene: The movie line. \nLeonard: Oh, I hope they let us in soon. I\u2019m tired of running to the gas station to use the bathroom. The guy makes me buy a Gatorade every time. It\u2019s a vicious circle.\nHoward: Too bad you don\u2019t have a stadium pal like me.\nLeonard: What\u2019s a stadium pal?\nHoward: Let me put it this way, takes care of the bathroom problem, and it keeps your calf warm.\nRaj: Hey, guys, bad news. I just did a quick calculation. Given the size of the theatre\u00a0 and the length of this line, we might not get seats.\nSheldon: What did he say?\nLeonard: Nice going, Raj, just got him down for his nap.\nSheldon: We might not get seats?\nLeonard: It\u2019s fine, it\u2019s fine. Go back to sleep.\nSheldon: Oh, I informed you thusly. I so informed you thusly.\nLeonard: Howard, you talk to him. Howard? You\u2019re peeing, aren\u2019t you?\nWil Wheaton: Hey, look who\u2019s here! Hey, buddies!\nSheldon: Well, if it isn\u2019t Wil Wheaton, the Jar Jar Binks of the Star Trek universe.\nWil: Mee-sa think that very funny.\nSheldon: Well, you-sa can go think that at the back of the line. No cuts, no buts, no coconuts.\nTheatre Staff: Wil Wheaton.\nWil: Yeah.\nTheatre Staff: I\u2019m a big fan.\nSheldon: Of what? Poorly executed beards?\nWil: Do you think you could get me and my friends into the movie? We got here a little late.\nTheatre Staff: No problem. Come on, I\u2019ll hook you up.\nWil: Oh, awesome. We-sa gonna go into the movie now. Bye-bye.\nSheldon: This is Indiana Jones, not Star Trek. There should be no value to his pseudo-celebrity here. And even at Star Trek conventions, they only let him in if he helps set up.\nLeonard: Calm down, Sheldon.\nSheldon: I will not calm down. This affront to justice and decency cannot go unanswered. As Captain Jean-Luc Picard once said, the line must be drawn here! This far, no farther!\nLeonard: Had to wake him up from his nap, didn\u2019t you?\n Scene: Penny\u2019s apartment. \nBernadette: You know what I really love about Howard? His chest hair.\nPenny: Howard has a hairy chest?\nBernadette: No, just the one. But it\u2019s really long.\nPenny: Okay, there you go, Sultry Sunrise Red. What do you think?\nAmy: My nails have never looked so pretty before. Get it off.\nScene: The movie line. \nRaj: Oh, oh, uh, looks like they\u2019re getting ready to let people in.\nSheldon: Listen to what Mr. Wil Wheaton is tweeting. Best seats in house for Raiders screening. Suck on that, Sheldon Cooper.\nLeonard: Why do you read his Twitter feed? You know it\u2019s only going to upset you.\nSheldon: I believe in knowing my enemy, Leonard. Had Twitter existed at the time, would not General Custer have followed the tweets of Sitting Bull? Would not Lee have followed Grant? Would not Spy have followed Spy? I have more examples, but excuse me. (On phone) Hello. Well, this seems like an odd time to test my cell phone quality, but go on. Test phrases? All right. Imatote. Ulbu. Twad. All together? I\u2019m a total buttwad. Why are you laughing? Hello?\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment.\nPenny: And that, girls, is how you make a phony phone call.\nAmy: I\u2019m not sure I grasp the full entertainment value, but all right. Next on Wikipedia\u2019s list of slumber party activities, Truth or Dare.\nPenny: Okay, it\u2019s your game. You go first.\nAmy: Hang on. I\u2019m familiarizing myself with the rules. Seems fairly straightforward. Bernadette, truth or dare?\nBernadette: Truth.\nAmy: All right. To what temperature must you heat beef in order to kill the prion that causes bovine spongiform encephalopathy?\nBernadette: Um.\nAmy: Remember, you have to answer honestly.\nPenny: Wait. No, Amy, you\u2019re supposed to ask her something personal or embarrassing.\nAmy: Oh. All right. What is the circumference of your areolas?\nScene: The movie line. \nSheldon: Munching on complimentary popcorn. Woot, woot. Oh, the gall. I hope his next tweet is popcorn lodged in trachea, choking to death, woot, woot.\nTheatre staff: Guys, I am sorry. We are full up.\nSheldon: No!\nTheatre staff: We\u2019re full up.\nLeonard: We really want to see this. Is there anything you can do?\nTheatre staff: Sorry. Fire regulations. Should\u2019ve gotten here earlier.\nSheldon: This is nothing but a blatant abuse of power by a petty functionary. Explain to me why Wil Wheaton and his lackeys get in and we don\u2019t.\nTheatre staff: \u2018Cause I\u2019m the petty functionary with the clipboard, bitch.\nHoward: I guess that\u2019s that. Let\u2019s go home.\nSheldon: You know what? I\u2019m going back to I told you so. I told you so.\nRaj: We can still see something. Uh, the new Sandra Bullock movie is playing two blocks away. You know Sandy B always brings it.\nSheldon: Look, a side door. Come on, Short Round.\nHoward: I guess we\u2019d better go after him.\nLeonard: Short Round?\nRaj: Indy\u2019s young sidekick from Temple of Doom.\nLeonard: Yeah, I know who it is, but why is it me?\nRaj: You\u2019re right. It should be a cuddly Asian boy. Like me.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment. \nAmy: And Absolon hath kist hir nether yea, and Nicholas is scalded in the towte. This tale is doon, and God save al the rowte.\u201d\nPenny: What the hell was that?\nAmy: Bernadette dared me to tell a dirty story. The Miller\u2019s Tale by Chaucer is the dirtiest story I know. It would have been hidden in sock drawers if people in the 14th century had worn socks.\nBernadette: I thought it was pretty spicy. Especially the part where he kisses her nether yea.\nAmy: You might not like it as much if you knew what nether yea meant. Hint, if one cares about hygiene, one ought not be kissing it.\nBernadette: Okay, my turn. Penny, truth or dare?\nPenny: Truth.\nBernadette: Why are you still hanging out with Leonard so much even though you broke up with him?\nAmy: Oh, that\u2019s an excellent question. For two people who claim to be no longer pair-bonded, you spend an inordinate amount of time in each other\u2019s company.\nBernadette: Yeah.\nPenny: Dare.\nAmy: I don\u2019t believe the rules allow for an ex post facto option change.\nBernadette: Yeah.\nPenny: Okay, look, just because we\u2019re not seeing each other anymore doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t be friends. I mean, Leonard\u2019s a great guy.\nAmy: Then, why did you terminate your relationship with him?\nPenny: I don\u2019t know. He got really serious, and I wasn\u2019t ready for it.\nAmy: Interesting. How will you react if, in the future, you become ready for it, and Leonard is unavailable, because another woman has realized that he is, to use your words, a great guy?\nPenny: You can only ask one question.\nAmy and Bernadette together: That one.\nPenny: You know what, I don\u2019t want to play anymore.\nAmy: Well, I\u2019m not sure how this is scored, but I believe we may have won.\nScene: The movie theatre.\nLeonard: Sheldon? Sheldon?\nHoward: Where did he go? (Raj whistles) We\u2019re looking for Sheldon, not Marmaduke.\nSheldon: You whistled?\nLeonard: What is that?\nSheldon: Raiders of the Lost Ark, with 21 additional seconds. If I can\u2019t see it, no one else can see it.\nLeonard: Sheldon, this is crazy.\nSheldon: No. Crazy was leaving the projection booth unattended.\nLeonard: Listen to me. You are over-tired. You\u2019re not thinking right. Put the movie back before we get into trouble.\nSheldon: Trouble is my middle name, Leonard. Actually, it\u2019s Lee, but I prefer Trouble.\nWil Wheaton: Oh, look who they let in.\nSheldon: Don\u2019t worry, Wil Wheaton. I was just leaving. \u00a0Da-da-da-da, da-da-da!\nHoward: Come on, Short Round.\nLeonard: Yeah.\nScene: Outside the movie theatre.\nSheldon: Da-da-da-da, da-da-da!\nRaj: Come on, guys! Hurry up! Hurry up!\nHoward: Let\u2019s see you run with a bag of urine strapped to your leg.\nWil: He\u2019s got the movie! Get him!\nSheldon: Why is there never a pontoon plane when you need one?\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment. \nBernadette: She\u2019s been in there a long time.\nAmy: Clearly, losing Truth or Dare upset her. Perhaps we should try to take her mind off it with another popular slumber party activity.\nBernadette: Ooh, like what?\nAmy: Well, the Internet suggests that slumber party guests often engage in harmless experimentation with lesbianism.\nBernadette: Where exactly on the Internet have you been looking?\nAmy: Penny?\nPenny: Oh, hey, Amy. Look, I\u2019m sorry I got so upset. I just,whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,whoa! What are you doing?\nAmy: Don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll avoid the nether yea.\nBernadette: I might have gone with eating raw cookie dough.\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "4_20": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: A bookstore.\nDr. Brian Greene: My new book, The Hidden Reality, takes on a grand question. Is our universe the only universe? You see, there\u2019s a growing belief among scientists like me that ours may only be one among many universes populating a gigantic cosmos. In The Hidden Reality, I explore this possibility without presuming any knowledge of mathematics or physics on the part of the reader.\nSheldon: Hysterical.\nAmy: I\u2019m glad you talked me into this. We work so hard, sometimes, it\u2019s nice to goof off and do something silly.\nSheldon: Agreed. Wait till you hear how he dumbs down Werner Heisenberg for the crowd. You may actually believe you\u2019re in a comedy club.\nGreene: You can think about Heisenberg\u2019s Uncertainty Principle much like the special order menu that you find in certain Chinese restaurants, where you have dishes in column A and other dishes in column B, and if you order the first dish in column A, you can\u2019t order the corresponding dish in column B. That\u2019s sort of like the Uncertainly Principle.\nSheldon: Ba-dum-bump.\nAmy: Say, I heard an interesting tidbit about Howard and Bernadette.\nSheldon: Really, Amy? Gossip? I\u2019m disappointed in you.\nAmy: Now, now. Evolutionary biologist Robin Dunbar has identified gossip as an aid to social bonding in large groups.\nSheldon: Forgive my language, but poppycock.\nAmy: What if he\u2019s right? And by not participating in gossip, society breaks down into small feral bands of tattooed motorcycle riders fighting to the death over the last few cans of tuna fish?\nSheldon: Fine. In the parlance of the urban music scene, what\u2019s the 4-1-1?\nAmy: Bernadette is thinking about breaking up with Howard.\nSheldon: I believe our nation\u2019s tuna cans are safe. Excuse me. Dr. Greene, question?\nGreene: Yes?\nSheldon: You\u2019ve dedicated your life\u2019s work to educating the general populace about complex scientific ideas.\nGreene: Yes, in part.\nSheldon: Have you ever considered trying to do something useful? Perhaps, reading to the elderly?\nGreene: Excuse me?\nSheldon: Yeah, but not your books. Something they might enjoy. I kid, of course. Big fan.\nCredits sequence\nScene: The apartment. The guys are playing on a Nintendo Wii.\nLeonard: Nice shot.\nSheldon: Thank you. My father taught me archery as a child. It\u2019s odd how the activity brings back the smell of Kmart bourbon.\nLeonard: Perfect.\nSheldon: I know. What an elf I would have made. Whoo, what do you think you\u2019re doing?\nLeonard: Shooting at a target?\nSheldon: With what?\nLeonard: An arrow.\nSheldon: Really? I didn\u2019t see you draw one from your quiver.\nLeonard: I\u2019m not going to do that, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Leonard, the people at Nintendo can only go so far in helping us recreate an actual athletic experience. We have to do our part, too. (Leonard mimes drawing an arrow and stabbing Sheldon with it.) That was uncalled for, but I\u2019ll play along. Ow! I had an unusual experience with Amy last night.\nLeonard: Really? How could you tell?\nSheldon: She was attempting to engage me in gossip.\nLeonard: You don\u2019t say?\nSheldon: Yes. I think prolonged exposure to Penny has turned her into a bit of a Gabby Gertie.\nLeonard: So, what\u2019s the gossip?\nSheldon: Oh, please, I was just pointing it out. I have no desire to engage in the activity.\nLeonard: Fine, don\u2019t tell me.\nSheldon: All right, get this. Bernadette is thinking about breaking up with Howard.\nLeonard: Oh. That\u2019s too bad. I wonder what happened.\nSheldon: Mm, it\u2019s hard to say. I can only speculate based on the data I collected watching my parents\u2019 marriage implode. In that case, the woman dives into religion, while the man dives into a bottle-blonde bartender who tries to buy my love with action figures. Oop! Out of arrows.\nLeonard: Boy, you sure get your money\u2019s worth out of these games.\nScene: The bathroom.\nLeonard: \u2013 Priya, can I come in?\nPriya: Sure.\nLeonard: Oh, God.\nPriya: What?\nLeonard: It\u2019s okay. You didn\u2019t know. I\u2019ll take care of it.\nPriya: What, what did I do?\nLeonard: Sheldon doesn\u2019t allow flossing that close to the mirror.\nPriya: You\u2019re kidding.\nLeonard: It\u2019s a splatter thing. There\u2019s a little piece of tape on the floor you\u2019re supposed to stand behind.\nPriya: That\u2019s madness.\nLeonard: I know. Just do it. There\u2019s a big inspection coming up, and I don\u2019t want to lose my TV privileges.\nPriya: You really need to let me take a look at that roommate agreement one of these days.\nLeonard: Mm, I don\u2019t know. I get a lawyer, he gets a lawyer, it\u2019s just easier to stand behind the tape.\nPriya: Oh, by the way, a fellow at work said I could use his Dodger tickets this weekend. Does that sound like fun?\nLeonard: Yeah! Dodgers are baseball, right?\nPriya: You\u2019ll need to explain the game to me.\nLeonard: Mm, it\u2019s complicated, but as I remember it, the essentials are, get chosen last, get hit by the ball, cry, go home.\nPriya: Well, regardless, I\u2019ve got four tickets, and I was thinking we can bring Bernadette and Howard. She\u2019s really interesting, and I bet I can get used to him.\nLeonard: Well, it might not be a great idea to invite those two.\nPriya: Why not?\nLeonard: Don\u2019t tell anybody I told you, but I heard she might be breaking up with him.\nPriya: Oh, too bad. Although I do know one person for whom that\u2019s good news.\nLeonard: Really? Who?\nPriya: My brother. He\u2019s got a big crush on Bernadette.\nLeonard: What? You\u2019re kidding!\nPriya: Mmm. I found poems he wrote about her. Very disturbing. Oh, Bernadette, please play my clarinet.\nLeonard: Wow, that\u2019s hard to believe.\nPriya: Yes. And for years, everyone in my family was convinced that he was the clarinet enthusiast. Hmm. What\u2019s that piece of tape?\nLeonard: Oh, that one doesn\u2019t apply to you. You sit.\nScene: The lobby. \nLeonard: Hey!\nPenny: Hey! How\u2019s it going?\nLeonard: Not too bad. Did you hear about Howard and Bernadette?\nPenny: \u2018Course I heard about it. How did you hear about it?\nLeonard: I heard about it from Sheldon. He got it from Amy.\nPenny: Oh, damn it. I told Amy that in the strictest confidence. Boy, some people are such blabbermouths. Well, whatever, I\u2019m sure Bernadette can do better.\nLeonard: Do you think a sexually ambivalent Indian astrophysicist with selective mutism and alcohol issues is better than a hundred-pound Jewish guy who lives with his mom?\nPenny: You are kidding. Raj likes Bernadette?\nLeonard: I didn\u2019t say Raj. Who said Raj?\nPenny: Okay, give. How do you know? Did he tell you?\nLeonard: No.\nPenny: Well, then who?\nLeonard: I can\u2019t say.\nPenny: Priya told you. What a little gossip. You know, not an attractive quality in a woman, Leonard. Not judging, just my opinion.\nLeonard: Well, The point is, if this got out, it would destroy Howard and Raj\u2019s friendship.\nPenny: You don\u2019t have to worry. Unlike Amy and Priya, I know how to keep a secret.\nLeonard: You\u2019re the one who told Amy in the first place.\nPenny: In confidence!\nScene: Raj\u2019s apartment.\nRaj: Hello, Mummy. Hello, Daddy. How are you?\nMrs Koothrappali (on webcam): We\u2019re very rich in a very poor country. So, all in all, can\u2019t complain.\nDr Koothrappali: So, Priya, how are enjoying staying with your brother?\nPriya: It\u2019s fine. But if I\u2019m going to stay in Los Angeles much longer, I think I should get my own place.\nMrs Koothrappali: Why? Is Rajesh not making you feel comfortable? Rajesh, why aren\u2019t you making your sister comfortable?\nRaj: I am making her comfortable. Besides, she\u2019s not sleeping here half the time anyway.\nDr Koothrappali: What? Where are you sleeping, Priya?\nPriya: It\u2019s a figure of speech, Daddy. It means I-I work late.\nMrs Koothrappali: Please tell me you\u2019re not dating an American. I knew this would happen. Rajesh, are you letting your sister date that little Howard boy?\nDr Koothrappali: Now, hold on. If she is dating an American, that\u2019s not a bad way to go. He\u2019s Jewish. Those chaps are very successful, and they don\u2019t drink a lot.\nRaj: It, it doesn\u2019t matter. Howard has a girlfriend.\nPriya: For now.\nRaj: What does that mean?\nPriya: I\u2019ll tell you later.\nRaj: Is something going on with him and Bernadette?\nMrs Koothrappali: Who\u2019s Bernadette?\nDr Koothrappali: Doesn\u2019t sound Jewish.\nMrs Koothrappali: You can\u2019t tell by that. Winona Ryder is Jewish.\nDr Koothrappali: Okay, we\u2019re getting off the subject. Rajesh, I want you to try harder to make your sister feel welcome.\nPriya: Thank you, Daddy.\nRaj: Don\u2019t worry. Everything I have, I share with her. Including my friend Leon\u2026\nPriya: Good night, Mummy. Good night, Daddy.\nRaj: Oh, my God, I think you broke my toe!\nPriya: Well you should have kept your mouth shut.\nRaj: Fair enough. Now, what\u2019s up with Clarinet? Bernadette!\nScene: The cafeteria.\nSheldon: I\u2019ve been thinking about Dr. Greene\u2019s efforts to make science palatable for the masses.\nLeonard: Oh, yeah? What about it?\nSheldon: That\u2019s all. I\u2019ve just been thinking about it. Now, I\u2019m thinking about fractal equations. Now I\u2019m thinking about the origin of the phrase train of thought. Now I\u2019m thinking about trains.\nRaj: Are you listening to this guy?\nHoward: Hmm? Oh, I\u2019m sorry. I was somewhere else.\nLeonard: Lucky bastard.\nSheldon: Now I\u2019m thinking about Jell-O.\nRaj: So what\u2019s up?\nHoward: It\u2019s a Bernadette thing.\nRaj: Oh, no. I hope everything\u2019s okay.\nLeonard: Whatever it is, we\u2019re here for you. You can tell us anything.\nRaj: Yeah. Good or devastating.\nHoward: I\u2019m gonna ask her to marry me.\nLeonard: Marry you?\nRaj: What?\nHoward: Yeah. I just need to figure out the right time to pop the question.\nLeonard: Oh, I\u2019d wait.\nRaj: No rush, no rush.\nHoward (phone rings): Oh, great. It\u2019s my cousin David about the ring. Hey, David, what\u2019d you find? Oh, sure, a half a carat\u2019s fine. Her freakishly small hands make anything look big. It\u2019s one of the reasons I love her.\nLeonard: Man, he\u2019s going to be blindsided.\nRaj: I know. It\u2019ll be awful.\nSheldon: Why are you smiling?\nLeonard: Yeah, Raj, why?\nRaj: Uh, a smile means something different in my country. You know, tears of joy, smile of sadness. India\u2019s a goofy place.\nSheldon: Oh, I\u2019m back to trains. Woo-woo.\nScene: The apartment.\nAmy: Did I tell you our lab got a grant to study addiction?\nSheldon: No.\nAmy: Fascinating work. I recently trained a capuchin monkey to smoke cigarettes.\nSheldon: Have you learned anything?\nAmy: Yes. He looks much cooler than the non-smoking monkeys. Although it\u2019s not much of a contest. The other monkeys just sit around and masturbate.\nSheldon: If you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019d like to stop listening to you and start talking.\nAmy: By all means.\nSheldon: Howard has announced his intention to propose marriage to Bernadette.\nAmy: I don\u2019t understand. The original piece of gossip indicated an impending breakup.\nSheldon: I know. The group consensus is that his proposal will be met with an humiliating, soul-crushing rejection. Everyone was set a-twitter. Although oddly, no one tweeted.\nAmy: It\u2019s not surprising that the story has captured the attention of our little circle of friends. Are you familiar with meme theory?\nSheldon: I\u2019m familiar with everything, but go on.\nAmy: Meme theory suggests that items of gossip are like living things that seek to reproduce using humans as their host.\nSheldon: I\u2019m no stranger to memetic epidemiology. At Johnson Elementary School, the phrase Shelly Cooper\u2019s a smelly pooper spread like wildfire.\nAmy: I should think so. That\u2019s gold.\nSheldon: Your meme hypothesis does intrigue me. How might we examine this more closely?\nAmy: Do you have any ethical qualms regarding human experimentation?\nSheldon: It\u2019s one of the few forms of interaction with people that I don\u2019t find repellent.\nAmy: We need to fabricate a tantalizing piece of gossip.\nSheldon: And a second non-tantalizing piece to use as a control.\nAmy: Then we\u2019ll track its progress through our social group and interpret the results through the competing academic prisms of memetic theory, algebraic gossip and epidemiology.\nSheldon: Look at you, getting me to engage in the social sciences. You\u2019re a vixen, Amy Farrah Fowler.\nScene: Penny\u2019s door.\nPenny: Oh, hey, Amy. What\u2019s up?\nAmy: Sheldon and I engaged in sexual intercourse. In other news, I\u2019m thinking of starting an herb garden. Mum\u2019s the word. Gotta go.\nScene: The Cheesecake Factory\nBernadette: Oh, hey, Raj, what are you doing here?\nRaj: I just felt like drinking alone, because I\u2019m deep and dark.\nBernadette: Uh-huh. So, uh, Howard\u2019s not here?\nRaj: No. It\u2019s just one of those times when it\u2019s just you and me. Like when the three of us went to the movies and you and I waited outside the bathroom while Howard threw up Red Vines and Cherry Coke. Do you remember that?\nBernadette: Yeah.\nRaj: Me, too. Good times.\nPenny: Hey, 16 wants to order appetizers.\nBernadette: Oh, thanks.\nRaj: This was nice.\nPenny: What the hell are you doing? Howard is your best friend, and that is his girlfriend. You should be ashamed of yourself.\nRaj: I was when I came in, but it\u2019s amazing what liquor does to guilt. Besides what you might not know is, Bernadette is planning on breaking up with Howard.\nPenny: Well, I know that. How do you know that?\nRaj: My sister told me.\nPenny: Oh, that gossipy bitch! No offense.\nRaj: None taken. You should hear how she talks about you.\nPenny: Okay, listen, just because Howard and Bernadette are having problems, does not mean you should be here sniffing around.\nRaj: What can I do? I can\u2019t stop thinking about her.\nPenny: All right, try thinking about this. Sheldon and Amy had sex.\nRaj: Shut your ass!\nPenny: Yeah, it\u2019s true. Amy told me.\nRaj: How did that even happen? Did they know that\u2019s what they were doing when they were doing it?\nPenny: I-I guess they just figured it out at some point.\nRaj: Wow. I can\u2019t believe old Smelly Pooper finally got laid.\nScene: The apartment. \nLeonard: Hey.\nSheldon: Hey.\nLeonard: Hope you\u2019re hungry.\nSheldon: Interesting. A friendly sentiment in this country, cruel taunt in the Sudan. It\u2019s a lesson in context.\nLeonard: Will Amy be joining us for dinner?\nSheldon: Yes, I believe so.\nLeonard: Good, good. Everything okay between you two?\nSheldon: Yes. Why do you ask?\nLeonard: No reason. I was just talking to Raj, and he mentioned what a lovely glow she has these days.\nSheldon: Did he mean as if she\u2019d been out in the sun, tending an herb garden without wearing a hat or sunblock?\nLeonard: No. That\u2019s not what he meant.\nSheldon: Well, we may never know. As my mother would say, the Asians are an inscrutable folk. Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I have work to do.\nLeonard: Yeah, you do. You dog, you.\nSheldon: Did you get that?\nAmy (on webcam): Every word. Our false gossip meme appears to have reached node lambda.\nSheldon: This is moving faster than we thought.\nAmy: Agreed. It appears the rate of gossip transmission is proportional to the number of nodes squared.\nSheldon: I must say, Amy, pretending to have intercourse with you is giving me a great deal of satisfaction.\nAmy: Slow down, Sheldon. I\u2019m not quite there yet.\nScene: The apartment, later.\nLeonard: Pass the soy sauce.\nHoward: Sure.\nAmy: Bernadette just asked about my sexual encounter with you. The meme has reached full penetration.\nSheldon: Pun intended?\nAmy: No. Happy accident.\nSheldon: This is remarkable. Took less than 24 hours.\nAmy: I should let you know that she asked for details about our dalliance.\nSheldon: Interesting. So it went beyond the mere fact of coitus to a blow by blow, as it were.\nAmy: Pun intended?\nSheldon: I\u2019m sorry. What pun?\nAmy: Not important. I described your lovemaking as aloof, but effective.\nSheldon: I wish you hadn\u2019t done that. That\u2019s going to make me a chick magnet, and I\u2019m so busy as it is.\nHoward: Hey, everybody, I got something I want to ask Bernadette, and I can\u2019t think of a better time than when I\u2019m with all my friends.\nLeonard: Oh, hold on, Howard. There\u2019s lots of better times.\nRaj: Leonard, please. The man is talking. Let him get it out, and let the chips fall where they may.\nHoward: Thank you. Bernadette Maryann Rostenkowski\u2026\nBernadette: Oh, God. What\u2019s happening?\nHoward: I know things haven\u2019t been perfect with us, and we\u2019ve had our problems, but I just have to tell you, from the moment I\u2026\nBernadette: Howard, let me just stop you right here.\nRaj: This is it.\nBernadette: Yes.\nHoward: Yes, what?\nBernadette: Yes, I will marry you.\nHoward: You will?\nRaj: You will?\nBernadette: I will. I will!\nHoward: Oh, I love you so much.\nBernadette: Oh, I love you, too.\nLeonard: Congratulations!\nPriya: Oh, it\u2019s so exciting.\nAmy: I wonder what changed her mind.\nSheldon: Perhaps your talk of my sexual prowess renewed her faith in love.\nAmy: As good an explanation as any.\nLeonard: That\u2019s great.\nScene: Penny\u2019s door. \nPenny: Oh, hey, Amy. Bernadette just texted me. Howard proposed?\nAmy: Yes, not important. Just stopped by to let you know I\u2019m getting orthotics. Also, I\u2019m carrying Sheldon\u2019s baby. Mum\u2019s the word.\nScene: The stairwell, moments later. Leonard is reading a text message. \nLeonard: You\u2019re pregnant?\nAmy: Wow. Is there anything on there about orthotics?\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "5_10": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The comic book store.\nHoward: It\u2019s amazing people keep coming to comic book stores instead of just downloading comics digitally.\nLeonard: It\u2019s probably for the best. For a lot of these guys, the weekly trip here is the only chance their mom has to go down to the basement and change their sheets.\nHoward: Oh, that reminds me, I get fresh sheets tonight. Yay.\nSheldon: Well? What do you think of New Comic Book Night? Magic, huh?\nAmy: Sheldon, I\u2019m disappointed. As a brilliant man, you\u2019re entitled to a vice. I could understand frequenting an opium den or hunting your fellow man for sport. But this? Lame-o.\nSheldon: Well, A, comic books employ storytelling through sequential art, a medium that dates back 17,000 years to the cave paintings of Lascaux, and B, you play the harp. Like that\u2019s cool.\nStuart: Can I help you find anything?\nAmy: A comic that depicts a woman whose bosom can\u2019t be used as a floatation device.\nStuart: Sorry. Most of the guys who come in here like big boobs. Couple of them have big boobs.\nRaj: Hey, look, the new Warlords of Ka\u2019a expansion pack is out.\nHoward: A new one? Unbelievable. They just keep making up more cheesy monsters, slapping them on cards and selling them at 25 bucks a pop. It\u2019s like a secret tax on guys who can\u2019t get laid.\nRaj: They\u2019re not even trying. Remember the Satanimals pack with the Hellephant? Why, absurd. What was he, a bad elephant who died and went to hell? What could an elephant possibly do that would cause him eternal damnation?\nHoward: Wild West and Witches? What kind of loser cares about a showdown between Billy the Kid and the White Wizard of the North?\nRaj: A total loser. Obviously a guy with a six-shooter beats an old man with a magic wand.\nLeonard: Well, ho-hold on. What if the wizard casts a Helmet of Confusion spell on Billy the Kid\u2019s cowboy hat?\nHoward: What? Please! This is Billy the Kid we\u2019re talking about. I mean, the wizard would get shot between the eyes before he could ever get out the words, what the hell is Billy the Kid doing in the mystic realm of Ka\u2019a?\nStuart: Leonard, what\u2019s the deal with Sheldon\u2019s friend Amy? Are they a couple?\nLeonard: Couple of weirdos. Why?\nHoward: You interested in Amy?\nStuart: Well, I mean, she didn\u2019t look through me with soul-sucking, ball-shriveling hatred and contempt. I like that in a woman. Could you run it by Sheldon if I could ask her out?\nLeonard: Sure. I guess.\nRaj: Stuart, settle an argument for us. Who would win, Billy the Kid or the White Wizard?\nStuart: If I tell you that, I\u2019m robbing you of the hours of fun you could have for the magical, rootin\u2019 tootin\u2019 low price of $24.95.\nRaj: I\u2019ll take one.\nHoward: Mmm, make it two.\nLeonard: I hate all of you and myself. Three.\nStuart: I\u2019ll ring it up. Like shooting nerds in a barrel.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: Hey, can I talk to you about something? It\u2019s a little awkward.\nSheldon: I know what this is about. Given the professional standstill you\u2019re at, you\u2019re wondering if this is the appropriate time to abandon your research and focus on teaching. Yes. And if I may suggest, consider changing disciplines. Yeah, to the humanities, perhaps history. One of the advantages of teaching history is that you don\u2019t have to create things, you know, you just have to remember stuff that happened and then parrot it back. You could have fun with that.\nLeonard: Yeah, that\u2019s not it. Stuart\u2019s kind of interested in Amy.\nSheldon: Oh, of course he is. She\u2019s very interesting. Did you know, when she was 14, she severed the webbing between her own toes?\nLeonard: No. He wanted me to find out if you\u2019d have a problem with him asking her out.\nSheldon: I\u2019m not sure how to respond, Leonard. I don\u2019t own Amy. Can\u2019t own a person. At least not since? 1863. President Lincoln freed the? Slaves! Come on Leonard, if you\u2019re going to teach history, these are the kind of facts you\u2019ll have to know.\nLeonard: You know what? Never mind. I\u2019m going to tell him it\u2019s okay to ask her out.\nSheldon: The question is moot. There is no way that Stuart, an impoverished peddler of picture books, would be at all appealing to Amy Farrah Fowler, a noted neurobiologist capable of performing surgery on her own feet with nothing but nitrous oxide from cans of whipped cream as anesthesia.\nLeonard: All right, but just for the record, I checked in with you to see how you\u2019d feel about it.\nSheldon: Fine. The record shall so reflect. Now, getting back to the problem at hand, what to do with a washed-up experimental physicist.\nLeonard: I am not washed-up.\nSheldon: Oh, Leonard. Lots of people love you and want to help you, but they can\u2019t until you admit the problem.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment.\nPenny: Well, ladies, we killed the bottle.\nAmy: I had half a glass.\nBernadette: I didn\u2019t have any.\nPenny: Okay, don\u2019t judge me. So, what do you want to do, go to the movies, go dancing, lay down for a little bit?\nAmy: Or we play Travel Twister.\nBernadette: Amy, really? Twister?\nAmy: Excuse me. I\u2019ve passed many an enjoyable evening playing this game. And I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a lot more exciting when you play with other people. What do you say, bestie? We can do shirts and skins. I\u2019m shirts. Called it.\nBernadette: I\u2019m too small for Twister. And roller coasters. And sitting with my feet on the floor. Hope you enjoyed the prenatal cigarettes, Mom.\nPenny: Hey, you know, my mom smoked pot when she was pregnant with me, and I turned out just fine. Hey, look, I have peach schnapps. Thank God.\nAmy (reading a text on her phone): Guys, something happened.\nPenny: What\u2019s wrong?\nAmy: I think a boy likes me.\nBernadette (reading): Hi. It\u2019s Stuart. We met at the comic book store. I was wondering if you\u2019d like to get coffee sometime. It\u2019s okay if you say no. It might be the kick in the pants I need to start taking Zoloft.\nPenny: Amy, little vixen. Just working it under all those layers of wool and polyester.\nBernadette: What are you going to do? Doesn\u2019t he know you have a boyfriend?\nPenny: Oh, she doesn\u2019t have a boyfriend, she has a Sheldon. So do you like Stuart?\nAmy: I don\u2019t know. He\u2019s nice. He\u2019s funny. He has the sallow, drawn countenance associated with an overactive thyroid gland. That\u2019s kind of hot.\nPenny: Okay, look, sweetie, we all love Sheldon, but you\u2019ve been with him over a year now. If it\u2019s not going anywhere, what does it hurt to look around?\nBernadette: Well, yeah, I guess they\u2019re not engaged like me and Howie.\nPenny: Yeah, for what it\u2019s worth, engaged people can look around, too. Lot of options out there.\nScene: The comic book store.\nSheldon: Where\u2019s Stuart?\nSpeccy Guy Behind Counter (sniggering): Out.\nSheldon: Who are you?\nSpeccy Guy: I\u2019m Dale. He left me in charge.\nLeonard: Really?\nDale: Yeah. I don\u2019t get it, either.\nLeonard: I want to return this Wild West and Witches Ka\u2019a expansion pack.\nDale: Sorry. I don\u2019t do returns. They\u2019re hard.\nLeonard: Sure, sure. Uh, when will Stuart be back?\nDale: I don\u2019t know. He went out for coffee. With a girl.\nSheldon: Oh, I guess I was wrong.\nLeonard: You okay?\nSheldon: Am I okay? Leonard, I\u2019m on a lifelong trajectory that includes a Nobel Prize and cities named after me, all four wisdom teeth fit comfortably in my mouth without need of extraction, and my bowel movements run like a German train schedule. Am I okay?\nDale: I\u2019m okay, too!\nScene: The apartment. They are playing Warlords of Ka\u2019a.\nRaj: Wild Bill Witchcock.\nLeonard: A tribe of Abra-Comanches.\nSheldon: Flaming Spittoon. And for the record, I\u2019m very disappointed in you cowpokes. We\u2019re playing our inaugural round of Wild West and Witches, and I\u2019m the only one who bothered to dress for the occasion. (Spits into a spittoon) Patooie.\nHoward: We\u2019re not wearing cowboy hats, Sheldon. It looks ridiculous.\nSheldon: And I suppose my boots and spurs are ridiculous, too?\nLeonard: Yeah.\nHoward: Very.\nRaj: Incredibly so.\nSheldon: Did it look ridiculous when we got the Satanimals pack and I dressed up as a Beelzebobcat?\nLeonard: Yeah.\nHoward: Very.\nRaj: Incredibly so.\nSheldon: All right, fine. Let\u2019s just play.\nLeonard: We should go easy on him. Amy\u2019s out with Stuart tonight.\nHoward: Wait a minute. Are you telling me that Sheldon\u2019s patented blend of condescension and no sex isn\u2019t enough to hold on to a woman?\nSheldon: Cluck, cluck, cluck. What are we, ladies at a quilting bee? Or are we men playing a fantasy card game set in a magical frontier town?\nHoward: Sorry. Creepy Tepee.\nRaj: Annie Ogly.\nLeonard: Hocus Pocus Pocahontas.\nSheldon: And may I point out it is the three of you who are obsessed with Stuart and Amy, not me. I think you need to ask yourselves who\u2019s really being ridiculous here. (Walks away with spurs jangling)\nLeonard: It\u2019s you.\nHoward: You are.\nRaj: Totally you.\nScene: The cafeteria.\nRaj: Hey, guys, check it out. The deluxe limited edition Wild West and Witches expansion pack in the signed and numbered collector\u2019s tin.\nLeonard: Oh come on, no! We just bought the regular pack.\nHoward: Ooh, a sheriff\u2019s badge.\nRaj: Yeah, it\u2019s also a wand.\nLeonard: With a hologram? Nice. Hey, do you see this?\nSheldon: I\u2019m in the matrix, Leonard, I see everything.\nLeonard: You\u2019ve got to be kidding me. You friended Stuart on Facebook?\nHoward: I thought you didn\u2019t like Facebook anymore.\nSheldon: Don\u2019t be silly. I\u2019m a fan of anything that tries to replace actual human contact.\nRaj: Please. You\u2019re looking at Facebook to find out how their date went.\nSheldon: Really? You think I care if a man, what, shared a pumpkin latte with a dynamite lady?\nRaj: You\u2019re so full of it.\nSheldon: You are free to believe whatever you like. And unfriend Rajesh Koothrappali.\nRaj: You unfriended me? Seriously?\nHoward: Oh, yeah. Now he\u2019s gonna miss all those great updates like, I can\u2019t believe I waited this long to make my own potpourri.\nLeonard: Sheldon, why don\u2019t you just acknowledge that you have feelings for Amy and you don\u2019t want her going out with other men?\nSheldon: And unfriend Leonard Hofstadter.\nHoward: Here\u2019s a radical thought. Go old-school, challenge Stuart to a fight. I mean, nothing makes the ladies hotter than two skinny white guys swatting at each other with their eyes closed.\nSheldon: And unfriend Howard Wolowitz.\nLeonard: That\u2019s all of us. Can I use the laptop?\nSheldon: Why?\nLeonard: I have to buy that stupid collector\u2019s tin.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment door. Sheldon knocks three times.\nPenny (off): Who do we love?\nSheldon: Penny. (Knock, knock, knock)\nPenny (off): Who do we love?\nSheldon: Penny. (Knock, knock, knock)\nPenny (off): Who do we love?\nSheldon: Penny.\nPenny: Hello, Sheldon. Come on in.\nSheldon: Thank you.\nPenny: What\u2019s up?\nSheldon: I came to ask if you would like to go on a date with me.\nPenny: I\u2019m sorry, what?\nSheldon: A date. You and me. Dining, dancing, perhaps you\u2019d like to take in a prizefight.\nPenny: God, are you trying to make Amy jealous?\nSheldon: No. Why is everyone so obsessed with Amy and Stuart? And whether or not they may be having more pumpkin lattes or intercourse tonight.\nPenny: Okay, listen to me. Playing games is not gonna help get Amy back.\nSheldon: I am not trying to get her back. But, out of curiosity, what is a way?\nPenny: All right, honey, let me tell you a story. There was a guy I liked, and I never told him how I felt. Eventually, he started going out with someone else, and I always regretted it. Do you see where I\u2019m going with this?\nSheldon: I believe I do.\nPenny: Mm.\nSheldon: I\u2019m the guy.\nPenny: You\u2019re not the guy.\nSheldon: Are you sure? That would explain so much. Your constant presence in my apartment, that baffling dalliance with Leonard just to be near me, the way you call me sweetie all the time.\nPenny: I call everyone sweetie.\nSheldon: You tramp.\nPenny: Look, Sheldon, all I\u2019m saying is strap on a pair and go talk to Amy.\nSheldon: Strap on a pair? Of what, skates?\nPenny: Oh, sweetie, you are so not the guy.\nScene: A cinema.\nStuart: If you\u2019re bored, you can go. I understand.\nAmy: No, I\u2019m having a nice time.\nStuart: Don\u2019t patronize me.\nSheldon: Excuse me. Excuse me. Pardon me. Pardon me. Excuse me. Hi, Stuart.\nStuart: Hi, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Pardon me. Excuse me.\nAmy: Sheldon, what are you doing here?\nSheldon: The thought of you sitting in a darkened theatre with a character like Stuart is repellent. No offence, Stuart.\nStuart: None taken. Although repellent is kind of a, kind of a strong word.\nAmy: I\u2019m sorry this causes you discomfort, but based on the currently established parameters of our relationship, I can put myself in any repellent situation I want.\nStuart: Um, again\u2026\nSheldon: Stuart, please. You\u2019re being rude.\nAmy: Anything else?\nSheldon: I believe I would like to alter the paradigm of our relationship.\nAmy: I\u2019m listening.\nSheldon: With the understanding that nothing changes whatsoever, physical or otherwise, I would not object to us no longer characterizing you as not my girlfriend.\nAmy: Interesting. Now try it without the quadruple negative.\nSheldon: You\u2019re being impossible.\nAmy: Hi, Stuart.\nSheldon: Fine. Amy, will you be my girlfriend?\nAmy: Yes.\nSheldon: Well, that\u2019s enough of that. Sorry to interrupt. You two enjoy your date. Here\u2019s a dollar for your troubles. Get yourself some Sour Patch Kids.\nScene: Outside Amy\u2019s apartment.\nStuart: So, other than you taking your relationship to the next level with another guy, this was nice.\nAmy: Yes, well, thanks for seeing me to my door.\nStuart: Oh, you\u2019re welcome.\nSheldon (inside): (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. Let\u2019s wrap things up out there.\nAmy: Um, good night, Stuart.\nStuart: Good night.\nSheldon (inside): Take the hint, Stuart. The lady said good night.\nAmy: How did you get into my apartment?\nSheldon: Wow. Is that the kind of nagging I can expect now that you\u2019re my girlfriend? Good thing I drew this up.\nAmy: What\u2019s that?\nSheldon: I present to you the relationship agreement. A binding covenant that, in its 31 pages, enumerates, iterates and codifies the rights and responsibilities of Sheldon Lee Cooper, here and after known as the boyfriend, and Amy Farrah Fowler, here and after known as the girlfriend.\nAmy: It\u2019s so romantic.\nSheldon: Mutual indemnification always is. Why don\u2019t you start perusing while I set up my notary stamp.\nAmy: Section 5: Hand-holding. Hand-holding is only allowed under the following circumstances. A: Either party is in danger of falling off a cliff, precipice or ledge. B: Either party is deserving of a hearty handshake after winning a Nobel Prize. C: Moral support during flu shots. Seems a bit restrictive.\nSheldon: Feel free to retain a lawyer.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment. The girls are playing twister.\nAmy: Penny, I said right hand red.\nPenny (picking up wine): Yeah, I heard you. I got red.\nAmy: Bernadette, left foot yellow.\nBernadette: We should play limbo next. No one beats me at limbo.\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Bernadette.\nAmy: That\u2019s my boyfriend. It\u2019s open!\nSheldon: I got a splinter.\nAmy: What do you want me to do about it?\nSheldon: Relationship agreement Section 4, Boo-boos and Ouchies. You have to take care of it.\nAmy: I should\u2019ve gotten a lawyer.\nBernadette: Looks like it\u2019s just us playing. (Penny snores) Penny? (Penny snores louder) Penny, we\u2019re out of wine!\nPenny (waking, bleary): You should probably drive.\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "3_10": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The apartment\nPenny: Hey, Leonard, check this out.

This is essentially why you have famine in India.\nPenny: You want me to put it back?\nSheldon: Leonard.\nLeonard: It upsets Sheldon when you play with the Sheldon.\nHoward (arriving): What\u2019s up, my nerdizzles? Raj, Sheldon, I want you to meet my girlfriend Bernadette.\nSheldon: Hello.\nHoward: Leonard, Penny, you know my girlfriend Bernadette.\nLeonard: Yeah.

The more, the merrier.\nSheldon: Wait, no, that\u2019s a false equivalency. More does not equal merry. If there were 2,000 people in this apartment right now, would we be celebrating? No, we\u2019d be suffocating.\nLeonard: Sheldon\u2026\nSheldon: Don\u2019t Sheldon me. We ordered for five people, not six.\nPenny: Oh, come on, it\u2019s fine. We\u2019ll just put it all on the table, you know, family style.\nSheldon: Oh, sure. And while we\u2019re at it, why don\u2019t we put our hands behind our backs, have an old-fashioned eating contest?\nLeonard: Relax, it\u2019ll be fine, sit down, you guys.\nEveryone: NO!\nBernadette: What?\nPenny: Oh, yeah, you can\u2019t sit there.\nBernadette: Why not?\nLeonard: That\u2019s where Sheldon sits.\nBernadette: He can\u2019t sit somewhere else?\nPenny: Oh no, no, you see, in the winter, that seat is close enough to the radiator so that he\u2019s warm, yet not so close that he sweats. In the summer, it\u2019s directly in the path of a cross-breeze created by opening windows there and there. It faces the television at an angle that isn\u2019t direct, so he can still talk to everybody, yet not so wide that the picture looks distorted.\nSheldon: Perhaps there\u2019s hope for you after all.\nCredits sequence.\n \nScene: A few moments later. \nBernadette: Ooh, I love your shoes.\nPenny: Oh, thanks. They are cute, aren\u2019t they?\nBernadette: Where\u2019d you get them?\nPenny: Shoes for Less.\nBernadette: I\u2019ve been meaning to go over there.\nPenny: Oh, great selection, great prices.\nSheldon: My mother was right.

Utero-Americans?\nPenny: Just eat your dinner.\nBernadette: Don\u2019t take him too seriously, a lot of what he says is intended as humour.\nPenny: Yeah, well, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s very funny.\nBernadette: Me neither, but he just lights up when I laugh.\nPenny: Howard, never let her go.\nBernadette: So, Leonard, Howard says you\u2019re working on fundamental tests of quantum mechanics.\nLeonard: I am. Are you interested in physics?\nBernadette: Oh, I find it fascinating. If I hadn\u2019t gone into microbiology, I probably would have gone into physics. Or ice dancing.\nLeonard: Actually, my tests of the Aharonov-Bohm quantum interference effect have reached an interesting point. Right now, we\u2019re testing the phase shift due to an electric potential.\nBernadette: That\u2019s amazing.\nSheldon: Yes. Leonard\u2019s work is nearly as amazing as third graders growing lima beans in wet paper towels. (Raj whispers to him) While I appreciate the oh, snap, I\u2019m uncomfortable having your moist breath in my ear.\nBernadette: Are you going to try to set up the voltages using tunnel junctions?\nLeonard: Yes, I am. You want to see a simulation on my laptop?\nBernadette: Oh, yeah, show me. In microbiology, the most exciting thing I get to work with is yeast.\nSheldon: Howard?\nHoward: Yeah?\nSheldon: Your shoes are delightful. Where did you get them?\nHoward: What?\nSheldon: Bazinga. I don\u2019t care.\nScene: The apartment. Sheldon and Raj are playing a racing game on the Wii.\nRaj: Ha! Eat my dust, racially stereotypical plumber.\nSheldon: That\u2019s not fair. I got stuck behind a tree.\nRaj: And a cow and a penguin. Face it dude, whether it\u2019s a real car or a virtual cartoon car, you can\u2019t drive.\nSheldon: Just need a little more practice.\nRaj: What you need is cheat codes, motor skills and a magic genie who grants wishes to little boys who suck at Mario Kart.\nPenny (knocking and entering): Hey, Sheldon, can I talk to you for a second?\nSheldon: It\u2019s not about shoes, is it? I don\u2019t think I could go through that again.\nPenny: It\u2019s not about shoes.\nSheldon: Then speak.\nPenny: Um, actually, can we do it in private?\nSheldon: All right. (To Raj) Go away. I agree, it\u2019s rude, but she asked for privacy.\nPenny: Thanks, Raj. Okay, so here\u2019s the thing, I was wondering if you could maybe teach me a little physics?\nSheldon: A little physics? There\u2019s no such thing. Physics encompasses the entire universe, from quantum particles to supernovas, from spinning electrons to spinning galaxies.\nPenny: Yeah, okay, cool. I don\u2019t need the PBS special, I just want to know enough so I can talk to Leonard about his job. You know, like Bernadette does.\nSheldon: Why can\u2019t Leonard teach you?\nPenny: \u2018Cause I want to surprise him.\nSheldon: Can\u2019t you surprise him in some other way? For example, I\u2019m sure he\u2019d be delightfully taken aback if you cleaned your apartment.\nPenny: Come on, Sheldon, this is important to me.\nSheldon: Penny, this would be a massive undertaking, and my time is both limited and valuable.\nPenny: You\u2019re sitting here playing video games all day.\nSheldon: Okay, point. What sort of foundation do you have? Did you take any science classes in school?\nPenny: Sure. I did the one with the frogs.\nSheldon: The one with the frogs.\nPenny: Yeah, actually, it was pretty cool. A lot of the girls threw up, but I gutted that thing like a deer.\nSheldon: I\u2019m sorry, Penny, I don\u2019t think so.\nPenny: Oh, come on! A smart guy like you, it\u2019ll be a challenge. You can make it like an experiment.\nSheldon: Interesting. I suppose if someone could teach sign language to KoKo the gorilla, I could teach you some rudimentary physics.\nPenny: Great! It\u2019s a little insulting, but great. I\u2019ll be KoKo.\nSheldon: Not likely. KoKo learned to understand over 2,000 words, not one of which had anything to do with shoes.\nScene: The university cafeteria.\nHoward: Hey, fellas. This is my girlfriend Bernadette. My girlfriend Bernadette.\nBernadette: Who are all those people?\nHoward: Have no idea. Hey, Leonard.\nBernadette: Hi.\nLeonard: Hey, look, it\u2019s Howard and his girlfriend Bernadette.\nHoward: Thought I\u2019d give the little woman a tour of the old salt mines.\nBernadette: He doesn\u2019t mean salt mines. He means where he works.\nLeonard: Yeah, no, I got it.\nBernadette: So, how\u2019s your experiment going?\nLeonard: Ah, terrific. We\u2019re getting the electron accelerator set up. We should be ready to go day after tomorrow.\nBernadette: Boy, I\u2019d love to see that.\nLeonard: You\u2019re welcome to come.\nBernadette: Really? Oh, that\u2019d be great. How exciting is that?\nHoward: Like Hanukkah in July.\nBernadette: Do they have that?\nHoward: No.\nBernadette: Oh. You got me again. This isn\u2019t non-fat yogurt, this is fatty fat fat. Excuse me.\nHoward: Could you grab me another napkin, sweetie?\nBernadette: Sure.\nHoward: Thanks, honey. (She goes) All right, what is your deal?\nLeonard: Excuse me?\nHoward: Inviting my girlfriend to come see your electron accelerator?\nLeonard: Yeah? So?\nHoward: Wow! You really are a piece of work. It\u2019s not enough you get the prom queen, you have to get the head of the decorating committee, too?\nLeonard: What are you talking about?\nHoward: Don\u2019t play innocent with me. I practically invented using fancy lab equipment to seduce women.\nLeonard: Has it ever worked?\nHoward: Not so far, but that\u2019s not the point!\nLeonard: Howard, relax, I\u2019m not interested in your girlfriend.\nHoward: I hope not, because you don\u2019t want to mess with me. I\u2019m crazy.\nLeonard: I believe you.\nScene: The apartment. \nSheldon: Research journal, entry one. I\u2019m about to embark on one of the great challenges of my scientific career, teaching Penny physics. I\u2019m calling it Project Gorilla.\nPenny: Hey, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Come in. Take a seat. Subject has arrived. I\u2019ve extended a friendly casual greeting.\nPenny: Ready to get started?\nSheldon: One moment. Subject appears well-rested and enthusiastic. Apparently, ignorance is bliss. All right, let us begin. Where\u2019s your notebook?\nPenny: Um, I don\u2019t have one.\nSheldon: How are you going to take notes without a notebook?\nPenny: I have to take notes?\nSheldon: How else are you gonna study for the tests?\nPenny: There\u2019s gonna be a test?\nSheldon: Tests. Here. It\u2019s college-ruled. I hope that\u2019s not too intimidating.\nPenny: Thank you.\nSheldon: You\u2019re welcome. Now, Introduction to Physics. What is physics? Physics comes from the ancient Greek word physika. It\u2019s at this point that you\u2019ll want to start taking notes. Physika means the science of natural things. And it is there, in ancient Greece, that our story begins.\nPenny: Ancient Greece?\nSheldon: Hush. If you have questions, raise your hand. It\u2019s a warm summer evening, circa 600 BC, you\u2019ve finished your shopping at the local market, or agora, and you look up at the night sky. There you notice some of the stars seem to move, so you name them planetes, or wanderer. Yes, Penny?\nPenny: Um, does this have anything to do with Leonard\u2019s work?\nSheldon: This is the beginning of a twenty six hundred year journey we\u2019re going to take together from the ancient Greeks through Isaac Newton to Niels Bohr to Erwin Schrodinger to the Dutch researchers that Leonard is currently ripping off.\nPenny: Twenty six hundred years?\nSheldon: Yeah, give or take. As I was saying, it\u2019s a warm summer evening in ancient Greece\u2026 Yes, Penny?\nPenny: I have to go to the bathroom.\nSheldon: Can\u2019t you hold it?\nPenny: Not for twenty six hundred years.\nSheldon: Project Gorilla, entry two. I am exhausted.\nScene: Howard\u2019s bedroom.\nBernadette: Howard?\nHoward: Huh?\nBernadette: It unhooks in the front.\nHoward: Oh, that explains a lot.\nHoward\u2019s Mother: Howard, I\u2019m home!\nHoward: Of course.\nHoward\u2019s Mother: Senior fitness was cancelled. It turns out you can forget how to ride a bike. I\u2019m fine, but, oy, did Sam Harpootian eat gravel.\nHoward: That\u2019s great, Ma!\nHoward\u2019s Mother: What\u2019s great about an 80-year-old Armenian man with half his chin scraped off?\nBernadette: I guess I should go.\nHoward: No, no, don\u2019t move. Hey, Ma, can I have lamb stew for dinner?\nHoward\u2019s Mother: Lamb stew? I\u2019d have to go to the supermarket.\nHoward: Please? I got a real hankering.\nHoward\u2019s Mother: Oh, I can\u2019t say no to my little tushy face. I\u2019ll be back soon.\nHoward: Thanks, Ma.\nHoward\u2019s Mother: Do you want the regular peas or the Le Seur?\nHoward: Always Le Seur peas with lamb stew!\nHoward\u2019s Mother: You\u2019re right! When you\u2019re right, you\u2019re right! What if they\u2019re out of the Le Seur?\nHoward: Then get the regular!\nHoward\u2019s Mother: All right! You don\u2019t have to yell!\nHoward: Sorry about that.\nBernadette (her phone chimes): Let me just put that on vibrate.\nHoward: I\u2019m already on vibrate.\nBernadette: You know, that one I got. Howard, did you say something to Leonard about me?\nHoward: Uh, what do you mean?\nBernadette: He says if I go see his experiment tomorrow it might weird you out.\nHoward: Really? He said that?\nBernadette: You\u2019re not jealous of Leonard, are you?\nHoward: Me? No. I may have mentioned that it\u2019s a little inappropriate to be asking another man\u2019s girlfriend to his experiment without first discussing it with said man.\nBernadette: Are you saying I need to ask your permission to hang out with Leonard?\nHoward: I didn\u2019t say anything like that. I said Leonard has to ask my permission. (Bernadette storms out) Come on, I don\u2019t want to eat lamb stew with my mother. Damn, I was this close on the bra.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Now, remember, Newton realized that Aristotle was wrong and force was not necessary to maintain motion. So let\u2019s plug in our 9.8 meters per second squared as A and we get force, Earth gravity, equals mass times 9.8 meters per second per second. So we can see that MA equals MG and what do we know from this?\nPenny: Uh, we know that\u2026 Newton was a really smart cookie. Oh! Is that where Fig Newtons come from?\nSheldon: No, Fig Newtons are named after a small town in Massachusetts. Don\u2019t write that down!\nPenny: Sorry.\nSheldon: Now, if MA equals MG what does that imply?\nPenny: I don\u2019t know.\nSheldon: How can you not know? I just told you. Have you suffered a recent blow to the head?\nPenny: Hey! You don\u2019t have to be so mean!\nSheldon: I\u2019m sorry. (Smiling) Have you suffered a recent blow to the head?\nPenny: No, you just suck at teaching.\nSheldon: Really? Of those two explanations, which one seems the most likely?\nPenny: Oh, God, Sheldon, look I\u2019m trying to understand, but you\u2019re going too fast. Can you just back up a little bit?\nSheldon: All right. It\u2019s a warm summer evening in ancient Greece\u2026\nPenny: Not that far back!\nSheldon: Okay! At what point did you begin to feel lost?\nPenny: I don\u2019t know. Where were we looking up at the night sky?\nSheldon: Greece.\nPenny: Damn it!\nSheldon: There\u2019s no need to get frustrated, people learn at different rates. Unlike objects falling in a vacuum, which\u2026? MA equals MG?\nPenny: Squared?\nSheldon: No.\nPenny: Aristotle?\nSheldon: No.\nPenny: Five?\nSheldon: Oh!\nPenny: Then I don\u2019t know.\nSheldon: Why are you crying?\nPenny: Because I\u2019m stupid!\nSheldon: That\u2019s no reason to cry. One cries because one is sad. For example, I cry because others are stupid and it makes me sad.\nPenny: Okay, look, can we just please forget about all this extra stuff and can you just tell me what Leonard does?\nSheldon: All right. Leonard is attempting to learn why sub-atomic particles move the way they do.\nPenny: Really? That\u2019s it? Well, that doesn\u2019t sound so complicated.\nSheldon: It\u2019s not. That\u2019s why Leonard does it.\nPenny: Okay, I just have one question. What exactly are sub-atomic particles?\nSheldon: A good question.\nPenny: Thank you.\nSheldon: And to answer it, we first must ask ourselves, what is physics?\nPenny: Oh, balls.\nSheldon: It\u2019s a warm summer evening in ancient Greece\u2026\nScene: Leonard\u2019s lab.\nHoward: Okay, I got a bone to pick with you.\nLeonard: What did I do now?\nHoward: I was in bed with Bernadette, and you text-blocked me.\nLeonard: What?\nHoward: We were completely naked, about to devour each other when, you text her that I have a problem with her hanging out with you.\nLeonard: You do have a problem with her hanging out with me.\nHoward: Yeah, but that\u2019s not what you tell her.\nLeonard: What was I supposed to tell her?\nHoward: I don\u2019t know, something that doesn\u2019t make me come off as a petty, jealous douche.\nLeonard: And what would that be?\nHoward: Come on, do I have to think of everything?\nBernadette: Hey, Leonard. Am I too late to see the experiment? Oh, hi.\nHoward: Hi.\nBernadette: What are you doing here?\nHoward: Same thing you\u2019re doing here. I came to see Leonard\u2019s experiment.\nBernadette: No, you didn\u2019t. You said Leonard\u2019s experiment was stupid.\nLeonard: You told her my experiment was stupid?\nHoward: I was just repeating what Sheldon said. Let\u2019s not get off topic, Bernadette, I need to apologize. I was wrong to tell you who you should be friends with.\nLeonard: Should I, um, leave you two alone?\nBernadette: No, Leonard, you should hear this.\nLeonard: Okay, good, \u2019cause I wasn\u2019t really gonna go.\nHoward: Look, I know I come off as confident and worldly, but the truth is I\u2019m not.\nLeonard: We\u2019re shocked.\nHoward: Which is why I tend to feel threatened by other guys.\nLeonard: Or loud noises, clowns and nuns.\nHoward: But I now realize how foolish that is.\nLeonard: He had a panic attack once when he got his head stuck in a sweater.\nHoward: It was a full turtleneck. Why aren\u2019t you helping me?\nLeonard: I don\u2019t know. Maybe because I\u2019m crazy?\nHoward: Bernadette, please, I\u2019m asking you to give me another chance.\nBernadette: What do you think, Leonard? Should I give him another chance?\nLeonard: It\u2019s up to you. He didn\u2019t call your experiment stupid.\nBernadette: Come here, tushy face.\nLeonard: Tushy face, that is going on Twitter right now.\nScene: The apartment. \nBernadette: Raj, you should\u2019ve seen Leonard\u2019s experiment. The interference pattern was so cool when the electron beam was on.\nLeonard: I\u2019m glad you enjoyed it. Most people aren\u2019t that interested in what I do.\nPenny: Actually, that\u2019s not true, Leonard. In fact, recently I\u2019ve been thinking that given the parameters of your experiment, the transport of electrons through the aperture the nano-fabricated metal rings is qualitatively no different than the experiment already conducted in the Netherlands. Their observed phase shift in the diffusing electrons inside the metal ring already conclusively demonstrated the electric analogue of the Aharonov-Bohm quantum-interference effect. That\u2019s it. That\u2019s all I know. Oh, wait! Fig Newtons were named after a town in Massachusetts, not the scientist.\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "7_16": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The apartment\nHoward: I\u2019m thinking about growing a goatee.\nRaj: Oh, actually that\u2019s a Van Dyke. A goatee is just hair on the chin.\nLeonard: Oh. Wait, then what is it if you just have hair up here?\nRaj: You mean a moo-stache?\nLeonard: Moo-stache.\nHoward: He said it.\nRaj: Ha-ha, very funny. Make fun of the foreign guy. For your information, there are four times as many Indians as there are Americans, so the way we say it is right.\nHoward: Say what?\nRaj: Moo-stache.\nLeonard: Moo-stache.\nHoward: He said it.\nBernadette: Guys, you\u2019re being childish.\nSheldon: Yeah, she\u2019s right. You\u2019re grown men, the kind who are perfectly capable of growing your own moo-staches.\nAmy: Hey, you were funny on purpose, good job.\nPenny: Hi. Sorry I\u2019m late, I was at an audition.\nLeonard: Oh, I\u2019m sorry.\nSheldon: You\u2019ll get \u2019em next time.\nPenny: How about instead of assuming I failed, you ask me how it went?\nLeonard: Sorry. How did it go?\nPenny: Just shut up.\nRaj: Here, you can have your seat.\nPenny: No, no, no, stay there. I\u2019m fine on the floor.\nBernadette: Have you guys ever thought about getting a dining room table?\nAmy: Yeah. You actually do have room for one up there.\nRaj: Oh, sure, I sit on the floor for years, no one cares. The pretty white girl\u2019s there ten seconds, and suddenly we\u2019re all running to IKEA.\nSheldon: No one is running anywhere. We\u2019re not getting a dining room table.\nLeonard: I know you don\u2019t like change, but it\u2019s not a terrible idea.\nPenny: Yeah, you guys never use that space up there. Why not get a table?\nSheldon: Do you want the long answer or the short answer?\nHoward: Hey, how come we never get that option?\nSheldon: Chaos theory suggests that even in a deterministic system, if the equations describing its behaviour are non-linear, a tiny change in the initial conditions can lead to a cataclysmic and unpredictable result.\nPenny: Translation?\nLeonard: Waah. I don\u2019t want a table.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: Hey, Penny and I are gonna go shop for a dining room table. You want to come with us?\nSheldon: You know, I\u2019d love to, but, um, I\u2019m too busy falling back in love with Windows 98.\nLeonard: Seriously? You haven\u2019t used this desk in years. The second I want to get rid of it, you\u2019re up here working?\nSheldon: I can\u2019t talk right now, I have several thousand updates to install.\nLeonard: Are you really gonna sit here all day?\nSheldon: Think of me as Arthur Dent in Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy, lying in front of the bulldozers to protect his home.\nLeonard: If you\u2019ll recall, the Vogon fleet blew up the Earth anyway.\nSheldon: It\u2019s a made-up story, Leonard, I don\u2019t even know why you\u2019re talking about it.\nLeonard: I\u2019m putting all this stuff in storage. We don\u2019t need any of it.\nSheldon: You, how can you say that? You show me one thing in here we can live without.\nLeonard: Oh, hang on. Check your in-box.\nSheldon: Wait. Is this really worth it? We\u2019ve lived together for years with nary an argument.\nLeonard: Huh?\nSheldon: But we start talking about a table, and suddenly we\u2019re at each other\u2019s throats.\nLeonard: Nary an argument? Nary?\nSheldon: Well, that means not one, or not any. Maybe instead of a table, you should buy a dictionary. Well, I don\u2019t know if I won that, but at least he\u2019s upset.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s apartment.\nHoward: Check it out.\nRaj: Magic wand TV remote?\nHoward: Yeah, I can control all sorts of stuff.\nRaj: Did Bernadette think it was cool?\nHoward: Not when I said mute and pointed it at her face.\nRaj: Oh, uh, let me try. Uh, channelis changeroni. This might be my second favorite brown magic wand.\nHoward: Well, that\u2019s the last time I play with that. (Phone rings) I have to take this. Hello? 00:04:24,137\nRaj: Uh, off. And on. And the Oprah Network. This is so much better than watching TV like a muggle.\nHoward: Okay. Thank you. We\u2019ll be in touch. You\u2019re not gonna believe this.\nRaj: What\u2019s going on? Oh. Wait. On. And off. What\u2019s going on?\nHoward: That was NASA. They want me to go back up to the space station.\nRaj: Wow. What did you tell them?\nHoward: I told them I\u2019d be honoured.\nRaj: A second trip to space, I\u2019ll miss you.\nHoward: And I\u2019m gonna miss you, too.\nRaj: And I just want you to know, I\u2019m happy to look in on Bernadette while you\u2019re gone.\nHoward: Thank you.\nRaj: And if anything were to happen to you, we will name our first born son Howard. I\u2019m just kidding. We\u2019ll name him Dalib, after my grandfather.\nScene: A furniture store.\nPenny: Ooh, this one looks nice.\nLeonard: No. Sheldon doesn\u2019t like reclaimed wood.\nPenny: Why not?\nLeonard: He\u2019s afraid the original owners will come back.\nPenny: Yeah. Well, Sheldon\u2019s not here.\nLeonard: Well, he is here. So unless you want to dig him out with a bone saw and a melon baller, there\u2019s nothing I can do about it.\nPenny: All right, sweetie, you\u2019re paying for this table, and it\u2019s your apartment, too.\nLeonard: I know, but\u2026\nPenny: No buts. You got to stop letting him boss you around.\nLeonard: You\u2019re right. I mean, he decides what TV shows we watch, what food we eat, who my favourite hobbit is. I wanted Frodo, but we can\u2019t both have Frodo, so guess who\u2019s stuck with Samwise Gamgee.\nPenny: See? Right there. You\u2019re a grown man, you should be able to pick whichever hobbit you want. Wish you wouldn\u2019t, but one problem at a time.\nLeonard: You make a lot of sense. I like this table, and I\u2019m getting it.\nPenny: Really? This one?\nLeonard: That one? Damn right I like that one.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s apartment.\nBernadette: Hey.\nHoward: Good news. Someone in this room gets to take a ride on a rocket.\nBernadette: Fine. Can I at least shower first?\nHoward: No, not that. Although you already agreed to it, so no take-backs.\nBernadette: What are you talking about?\nHoward: Sit down. NASA called. The telescope mount I installed on the space station got damaged, and they want me to go back up and fix it.\nBernadette: Wow. Well, what did you say?\nHoward: What do you think I said? I said yes. Why do you look surprised?\nBernadette: Well, it\u2019s just, after last time, I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d ever want to go back.\nHoward: Are you kidding? It was the greatest experience of my life.\nBernadette: Really? \u2018Cause I kind of remember a lot of complaining and wishing for it to be over.\nHoward: I think you have me confused with what\u2019s gonna happen when you get out of that shower.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: Hey, all set. What do you think? There\u2019s plenty of room for everybody, a view out the window.\nSheldon: My spot on the couch has a great view of a window. Sometimes I can see space battles through it. It\u2019s called a TV.\nPenny: Give it a chance, Sheldon, you might actually like it.\nSheldon: You\u2019re absolutely right. Nope.\nPenny: Well, you can\u2019t say he didn\u2019t give it a fair shot.\nSheldon: So, when can we get rid of it?\nLeonard: We\u2019re not.\nSheldon: What about the roommate agreement? It specifically states that any changes in furnishing have to be approved by the Furnishing Committee. Which only sits on alternate years. Yeah, and by the way, it sits over there.\nPenny: Come on, that is ridiculous.\nLeonard: She\u2019s right, a committee that important should meet more often.\nPenny: That\u2019s not what I\u2019m saying.\nLeonard: Oh. This is the thing about me standing up to him and not letting him run my life?\nPenny: Yes.\nLeonard: That.\nSheldon: Okay. I think we\u2019ve found the problem here. It\u2019s not the table at all. It\u2019s you.\nPenny: Me?\nLeonard: Well, it\u2019s always me, take one for the team.\nSheldon: I have spent years turning this lump of clay into an acceptable conduit for my will, and then you came along and reshaped him, with your newfangled ideas and your fancy genitals.\nPenny: Are you gonna let him talk to me like this?\nLeonard: Fancy sounds like a compliment.\nPenny: Okay, I have not tried to change Leonard. That\u2019s just what happens in relationships. Look how much Amy\u2019s changed you.\nSheldon: That\u2019s not true.\nPenny: Oh, please. When I first met you, you were incapable of touching another human being. Now you\u2019re holding hands, you\u2019re going on dates, you even made out with her on a train.\nSheldon: She told you?\nPenny: Of course she told me, it\u2019s the most interesting thing that\u2019s ever happened to her in her entire life.\nLeonard: You\u2019re too close to it, but Amy has had a huge impact on you.\nSheldon: You\u2019re right. Without realizing it, I\u2019ve allowed that woman to alter my personality.\nLeonard: Mm, Sheldon, you didn\u2019t have a personality, you just had some shows you liked.\nSheldon: No. No, I\u2019ve changed. Like the frog who\u2019s put in a pot of water that\u2019s heated so gradually he doesn\u2019t realize he\u2019s boiling to death.\nPenny: Or you\u2019re the frog who\u2019s been kissed by a princess and turned into a prince.\nLeonard: Or you\u2019re just a tall, annoying frog.\nSheldon: Excuse me. I have to break up with my girlfriend.\nPenny: Oh, Sheldon, wait.\nSheldon: No. You\u2019ve opened my eyes to the truth. Amy has made me a more affectionate, open-minded person. And that stops now.\nLeonard: Well, we should call her.\nPenny: Yeah, mm-hmm. Amy, it\u2019s Penny. Hey. Just a little heads-up. Leonard bought a dining room table. Yeah. Sheldon\u2019s breaking up with you.\nScene: Amy\u2019s apartment.\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Amy? (Knock, knock, knock) Amy? (Knock, knock, knock) Amy? I\u2019ll get right to the point. I think we need to end this relationship, so just sign this with your finger, and, uh, please don\u2019t cry on my iPad, I didn\u2019t get AppleCare.\nAmy: I\u2019m not surprised you want to end the relationship. I\u2019m a little surprised you didn\u2019t get AppleCare. Anyway, enjoy your life. Where do I sign?\nSheldon: At the bottom. I must say, I\u2019m relieved you\u2019re not making more of a scene out of this.\nAmy: Oh, I\u2019ve already moved on. Besides, this breakup has nothing to do with me.\nSheldon: It doesn\u2019t?\nAmy: Of course not. This is just Leonard trying to take the focus off that dreadful table by sowing discord in our relationship. He\u2019s manipulating you like he always does.\nSheldon: Wait, wait, now, hang on. You think he manipulates me?\nAmy: All the time. And he knew that, as your girlfriend, I wasn\u2019t gonna stand by and let him bring a table into your apartment. I mean, a table? Come on?\nSheldon: It is hideous.\nAmy: Well, thankfully, I won\u2019t have to see it, \u2019cause I won\u2019t be your girlfriend anymore. Amy Farrah Fowler. Why, yes, I would like to take a survey.\nSheldon: Wait. You were really gonna stand by me against the dining room table?\nAmy: Of course I was.\nSheldon: Wait. How do I know that you\u2019re not manipulating me right now?\nAmy: I think if I were manipulating you, you\u2019d be smart enough to see it.\nSheldon: How do I know you\u2019re not saying that as part of the manipulation?\nAmy: I think you\u2019d be smart enough to see that, too.\nSheldon: Okay. I\u2019m sorry I gave you such a hard time, I just had to be sure.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s apartment.\nRaj: It\u2019s pretty exciting that NASA wants to send Howard back up.\nBermadette: Yeah, exciting. Can I ask you something?\nRaj: Course.\nBernadette: He hated that entire experience. Does it make me an awful wife if I don\u2019t think he should do it again?\nRaj: Not at all. He\u2019s forgotten how miserable he was the entire time he was up there. It\u2019s like me in those moments when I miss India.\nBernadette: So you\u2019ll talk to him?\nRaj: Why me?\nBernadette: Well, I\u2019m his wife, I don\u2019t want to ruin it for him.\nRaj: That\u2019s the dynamic, I\u2019m the fun one, you\u2019re the buzzkill.\nBernadette: Since when am I the buzzkill?\nRaj: Do you think this is cool?\nBernadette: No, I think it\u2019s stupid.\nRaj: Aha.\nBernadette: You\u2019re right, it\u2019s great.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Hello.\nLeonard: Oh, hey. You guys didn\u2019t break up.\nSheldon: No. Sorry to disappoint you, but Amy pointed out that you were only trying to manipulate me.\nAmy: Which you also figured out by yourself.\nSheldon: Which I also figured out by myself.\nPenny: Well, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re still together.\nSheldon: Yeah, okay, you can stop trying to make this about our relationship.\nAmy: Which is stronger than ever.\nSheldon: Which is stronger than ever. This is about you trying to change my environment, which was perfect the way it was.\nHoward: But it got the way it was through change. The-the-the spot that you love to sit in, that no one else can sit in, only exists because, despite your objections. I bought this couch. Me. So explain why that change was bad and this change was good.\nSheldon: Um.\nAmy: You don\u2019t need to explain yourself to him.\nSheldon: I don\u2019t need to explain myself to you!\nAmy: You\u2019re sick of his nonsense and ready to move in with me.\nSheldon: Keep the table. We don\u2019t use that space.\nAmy: Damn it, I got cocky.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s apartment.\nHoward: Hey, Bernie. I\u2019m home. Hello.\nBernadette: Hi, honey.\nHoward: What\u2019s going on?\nBernadette: Maybe you should have a seat.\nHoward: Um, okay. I know my mom\u2019s not dead, there\u2019d be balloons.\nRaj: Um, okay. First off, know that we all love you and cherish you.\nMike Rostenkowski: Well, I wouldn\u2019t\u2026\nBernadette: Daddy.\nMike R: You\u2019re great.\nMike Massimino (on skype): Can I say something?\nRaj: Oh, of course.\nMike M: Hey, Fruit Loops.\nHoward: Massimino? Why are you here?\nMike M: Well, I heard you were thinking about going back up to the space station, and as someone who\u2019s been there with you, well, you know how astronauts need to have the right stuff?\nHoward: Sure.\nMike M: The stuff you have is wrong.\nHoward: You don\u2019t think I did a good job up there?\nMike M: You did a fine job. It\u2019s just, you were scared and miserable the whole time.\nBernadette: I think what we\u2019re all trying to say is, you don\u2019t seem to be remembering how traumatic the experience was for you.\nRaj: Like how women often forget the pain of childbirth.\nMike R: Like a woman. Great analogy.\nHoward: Fine, maybe I was a little scared.\nMike M: You peed in your space suit.\nHoward: You\u2019re supposed to do that.\nMike M: Not during the fitting.\nMike R: Son, do I need to remind you what you asked me to do before you went up last time?\nHoward: Hang on. That was just me joking around.\nMike R: You wanted me to shoot you in the foot.\nHoward: Come on, how is that not a joke? You got to get me out of this. Shoot me in the foot.\nBernadette: Don\u2019t forget all the other astronauts picking on you.\nRaj: And how you threw up in zero gravity, and it floated back in your mouth. And you threw up again. And so on and so on.\nMike M: That was funny.\nHoward: Okay, so I wasn\u2019t exactly John Glenn up there, but I\u2019ve changed. I\u2019m a different man now. Yeah, and I\u2019m a little insulted that you guys don\u2019t think I can handle it.\nMike M: You know you\u2019re gonna have to go through survival training again.\nHoward: Really?\nScene: A doctor\u2019s surgery.\nHoward: You\u2019ve got to get me out of this.\nDoctor: What do you want me to do? You\u2019re perfectly healthy.\nHoward: Check my blood pressure again. I can get it higher. just give me a second. (Dials phone) \nMrs Wolowitz (on phone): Hello?\nHoward: Hi, Ma. How are you?\nMrs Wolowitz: How I am is not dead, but you wouldn\u2019t know that, because you don\u2019t love me enough to pick up the phone.\nHoward: Go, go, go.\nMrs Wolowitz: For all you know, I could have slipped in the tub and drowned. That\u2019s what happened to your Aunt Ida.\nDoctor: Wow.\nScene: The apartment.\nRaj: Howard, I\u2019m so sorry your blood pressure was off the charts.\nHoward: Oh, me, too. I mean, the doctor was willing to fudge the results, but it just seemed so darned dishonest.\nLeonard: But the mission wouldn\u2019t be for at least a year. Isn\u2019t that enough time to get your blood pressure under\u2026\nHoward: Look, my blood pressure\u2019s too high, okay? Drop it.\nPenny: You know, my aunt changed her diet, and in a few months, she\u2026\nHoward: Went to space? I don\u2019t think so. Now, pass the soy sauce. Hey, not the green one, the red one.\nPenny: Sheldon, Amy, will you please come join us?\nBernadette: Yeah, it\u2019s fun up here.\nLeonard: So why are you trying to ruin it?\nSheldon: No, thanks. We\u2019re fine. I mean, if you people want to eat at the table, then that\u2019s what you should do. I like eating down here because this is how we\u2019ve always done things. But if those days are gone, they\u2019re gone. It just makes me sad.\nBernadette: Now I feel bad.\nLeonard: Oh, don\u2019t anthropomorphize him, he\u2019s got big eyes, but his feelings are not like ours.\nBernadette: No, it just seems silly for us to sit in two groups.\nLeonard: Well, it\u2019s not silly if you think of that group as being led by a big, evil baby.\nBernadette: Look at Amy down there. Should we go?\nPenny: Yeah, let\u2019s go.\nLeonard: But Penny, this was your idea. You said that I should stand up to him.\nPenny: Forget it, Leonard. It\u2019s over.\nLeonard: Fine.\nAmy: Rajesh?\nRaj: Screw that! I sat on the floor for seven years. I\u2019m staying right here.\nBernadette: Come on, Raj, it\u2019s not the same without you.\nRaj: Fine. But no more making fun of how I say tings.\nHoward: You mean tings like moo-stache?\nSheldon: Well, isn\u2019t this nice. Sometimes the baby wins.\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "4_4": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The Cheesecake Factory.\nRaj: I\u2019m telling you, if xenon emits ultraviolet light, then those dark matter discoveries must be wrong.\nSheldon: Yes, well, if we lived in a world where slow-moving xenon produced light, then you\u2019d be correct. Also, pigs would fly, my derriere would produce cotton candy, and The Phantom Menace would be a timeless classic.\nRaj: Oh, you\u2019re so arrogant. If you were a superhero, your name would be Captain Arrogant. And you know what your superpower would be? Arrogance.\nSheldon: You\u2019re wrong again. If my superpower were arrogance, my name would be Dr. Arroganto.\nHoward (laughs): I love watching Raj and Sheldon try to work together.\nLeonard: Yeah, it\u2019s like if Alien and Predator decided to go partners in a Jamba Juice.\nRaj: Has it occurred to you you\u2019re missing the big picture? If you look at neutron scattering data\u2026\nSheldon: Oh, Penny? Penny?\nPenny: What\u2019s up?\nSheldon: Nothing. I just wanted to make Raj stop talking.\nHoward (after Raj whispers to him): No, no, no. He won. Suck it up.\nPenny: Well, I\u2019d ask you guys if you want dessert, but I know Sheldon doesn\u2019t eat dessert on Tuesdays. And even if Raj wanted something, he couldn\u2019t tell me. Howard won\u2019t order anything, but he will come up with some sort of skeevy comment involving the words pie or cheesecake. And Leonard\u2019s lactose intolerant, so he can\u2019t eat anything here without his intestines blowing up like a balloon animal.\nLeonard: Hang on a second. I could have the fruit platter.\nPenny: You want the fruit platter?\nLeonard: Does it have melon on it?\nPenny: Yeah.\nLeonard: No, I can\u2019t eat melon.\nPenny: Oh, Howard, heads up. Your ex-girlfriend just came in for her shift.\nLeonard: When was the last time you saw her?\nHoward: Oh, not since we broke up. Wow. How am I going to play this? Sophisticated and relaxed? Friendly, noncommittal? Cold and distant? (Hides under table).\nBernadette: Hi, guys.\nLeonard: Hey.\nSheldon: Hello. I see you decided to go with pathetic and frightened.\nRaj: It\u2019s one of his best moves.\nCredits sequence.\n \nScene: Howard\u2019s bedroom. Howard enters in a silk dressing gown, puts on romantic music and sets up mood lighting. Gets onto bed.\nHoward: So, my dear, we meet again.\nKatee Sackhoff: Hello, Howard. I\u2019ve missed you.\nHoward: I\u2019ve missed you, Katee Sackhoff.\nKatee Sackhoff: One question.\nHoward: Anything.\nKatee Sackhoff: Why am I wearing my Battlestar Galactica flight suit in bed?\nHoward: Why are you in bed with me? If we start to question this, it all falls apart.\nKatee Sackhoff: Sorry. Oh, ravish me, Howard. My loins ache for you.\nHoward: Okay, if you insist.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Howard, have you seen my girdle?!\nHoward: No, Ma!\nMrs Wolowitz: I can\u2019t find it, and I\u2019m late for my Weight Watchers meeting!\nHoward: Maybe it committed suicide! Leave me alone! Now, where were we?\nBernadette: I believe you were about to rip off my uniform with your teeth.\nHoward: Bernadette? What are you doing here?\nKatee Sackhoff: Well, if I had to guess, I\u2019d say I\u2019m here because you saw me earlier this evening, and you\u2019re still hung up on me.\nHoward: No, I\u2019m not.\nBernadette: Clearly you are. Otherwise, based on past experience, we\u2019d be done by now.\nHoward: Okay, I\u2019m a little confused here.\nGeorge Takei: Oh, my. Can I help?\nHoward: Not that kind of confused.\nBernadette: What\u2019s George Takei doing here?\nKatee Sackhoff: Howard, do you have latent homosexual tendencies?\nHoward: No, of course not.\nGeorge Takei: So you say. Yet, here I am.\nKatee Sackhoff: George, let me ask you something. How did you deal with being typecast as a science fiction icon?\nGeorge Takei: It\u2019s difficult. You try and stretch as an actor, do Strindberg, O\u2019Neill, but all they want is, Course laid in, Captain.\nKatee Sackhoff: Tell me about it. It\u2019s frackin\u2019 frustrating.\nHoward: Wait. Katee, why are you leaving?\nBernadette: She\u2019s leaving because you really want to be with me.\nMrs Wolowitz: Howard, I found my girdle! It was in the dryer!\nHoward: Great, Ma!\nMrs Wolowitz: I think it shrunk! I\u2019m spilling out like the Pillsbury Doughboy here!\nHoward: And with that mental picture, I think we\u2019re done for the evening.\nScene: The university cafeteria.\nLeonard: You know, you never told me what happened between you and Bernadette.\nHoward: I did a stupid thing.\nLeonard: Yeah, I guessed that.\nHoward: It was the kind of thing that makes it kind of hard to face her now.\nLeonard: That covers anything from farting in bed to killing a homeless guy. Oh, my God. You ran over a hobo.\nHoward: No. Stop asking.\nLeonard: All right, fine. So you want to get back together with her, but you\u2019re too ashamed to face her because of whatever it is you did.\nHoward: In a nutshell.\nLeonard: Okay. Well, how about this? Kidnap Bernadette from the opera wearing a creepy mask so she doesn\u2019t know it\u2019s you.\nHoward: Now, you see, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re kidding or not.\nRaj: You\u2019re being unreasonable. Why can\u2019t I have a desk?\nSheldon: Our collaboration is a work of the mind. We don\u2019t need desks.\nRaj: You have a desk.\nSheldon: Correct.\nRaj: But I can\u2019t have one.\nSheldon: You\u2019re two for two.\nLeonard: Why can\u2019t he have a desk, Sheldon?\nSheldon: Oh, Lord, will this day never end? As I\u2019ve explained repeatedly to Dr. Koothrappali, whose ability to comprehend the American idiom fails him when it\u2019s convenient, there\u2019s absolutely no money in my budget for additional office furniture.\nRaj: Oh, but there\u2019s money for a drawer full of Red Vines, a marshmallow shooting rifle, and a super executive ant farm with glow-in-the-dark sand?\nSheldon: Yes.\nHoward: Okay, what if he buys his own desk?\nRaj: Yeah, what if I buy my own desk?\nSheldon: That\u2019s ridiculous.\nHoward: Why?\nSheldon: Because\u2026\nRaj: Yes?\nSheldon: It\u2019s my office.\nLeonard: Sheldon.\nSheldon: All right, all right. He can buy his own desk.\nRaj: And I can put it in your office?\nSheldon: Well, you really want to dot the I\u2019s and cross the T\u2019s, don\u2019t you?\nLeonard: Why would you want a glow-in-the-dark ant farm?\nSheldon: They do some of their best work at night.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment. Penny is gathering laundry.\nPenny (picking up a top and sniffing it): Ah, it\u2019s okay.\nSheldon (voice): (Knock, knock, knock) Penny? (Knock, knock, knock) Penny? (Knock, knock, knock) Penny? (Penny opens door. Howard is stood outside with a hand-held voice recorder.) Penny?\nHoward: Would you have opened the door if you knew it was me?\nPenny: Not since I found out the teddy bear you gave me had a webcam in it.\nHoward: I just have a question. Does Bernadette ever talk about me?\nPenny: Oh, absolutely.\nHoward: She does?\nPenny: Yeah, sure. Just yesterday, she asked, why is Howard hiding under the table?\nHoward: She saw that, huh?\nPenny: Oh, no, not at first. Right after I pointed it out.\nHoward: Let me ask you something else. Is she seeing anybody?\nPenny: Uh, not that I know of. Hey, while we\u2019re on the subject, why did you guys break up anyway?\nHoward: Oh, I\u2019d rather not say.\nPenny: Howard, if you want my help, I\u2019ve got to know what happened.\nHoward: But it\u2019s embarrassing.\nPenny: Yeah, that\u2019s what I\u2019m counting on. Spill.\nHoward: Okay. Well, you know World of Warcraft?\nPenny: Um, the online game? Sure.\nHoward: Well, did you know that the characters in the game can have sex with each other?\nPenny: Oh, God. I think I see where this is going.\nHoward: Her name was Glissinda the Troll. Bernadette walked in on me while we were doing the cyber-nasty under the Bridge of Souls.\nPenny: Oh, you\u2019re right. That is so embarrassing.\nHoward: Would you talk to her?\nPenny: Bernadette or the troll?\nHoward: Bernadette. She was so mad at me, she wouldn\u2019t even listen to my side of the story.\nPenny: Well, what was your side?\nHoward: Well, for all we know, Glissinda the Troll wasn\u2019t even a real woman. I mean, she could\u2019ve been a 50-year-old truck driver in New Jersey.\nPenny: Really? And that didn\u2019t make her feel better?\nHoward: Will you talk to her, see if there\u2019s any chance at all we could get back together?\nPenny: Oh, gee, Howard, I really don\u2019t want to get in the middle of this.\nHoward: No. Why would you? I\u2019m just another lonely nerd, living with his mother, trying to find any scrap of happiness he can. You know, maybe to make up for the fact that his dad left him when he was 11.\nPenny: Okay, I will think about it.\nHoward: You know, I\u2019ve always blamed myself for him leaving. I always thought it was because I wasn\u2019t the son he wanted.\nPenny: Yeah, I said I\u2019d think about it.\nHoward: I wasn\u2019t athletic, yeah, I was kind of sickly.\nPenny: Okay, fine. Look, look, I\u2019m calling her now! See?\nHoward: Thank you.\nScene: A corridor at the university.\nLeonard: So anyway, Howard asked Penny to talk to Bernadette, and she did, and Bernadette agreed to meet him for a cup of coffee.\nSheldon: One question.\nLeonard: Yeah?\nSheldon: Why on earth are you telling me all this?\nLeonard: I don\u2019t know. Sometimes your movements are so lifelike, I forget you\u2019re not a real boy.\n(Sheldon opens his office door. It bangs against a desk. Inside, Raj is sat behind a huge, ornate antique wooden desk in an enormous antique swivel chair.)\nRaj: You said I could buy a desk.\nSheldon: This isn\u2019t a desk. This is a Brobdingnagian monstrosity.\nRaj: Is that the American idiom for giant, big-ass desk?\nSheldon: It\u2019s actually British.\nRaj: Can you say it again for me?\nSheldon: Brobdingnagian.\nRaj: One more time?\nSheldon: Brobdingnagian.\nRaj: Now three times fast?\nSheldon: Brobdingnagian, Brobdingna\u2026 How did you even get it in here?\nRaj: That\u2019s for me, Ramon, Julio, Jesus and Rodrigo to know and you to find out.\nSheldon: All right, you\u2019ve made your point. A fine prank, very amusing. Now get it out.\nRaj: No.\nSheldon: Yes.\nRaj: No.\nSheldon: Yes.\nRaj: No.\nSheldon: Yes.\nRaj: I have three brothers and two sisters, Sheldon, I can do this all day.\nSheldon: All right, if you\u2019re not going to remove it, I\u2019ll remove it for you.\nRaj: Knock yourself out.\nSheldon: Help me move my desk.\nRaj: No.\nSheldon: Yes.\nRaj: No.\nSheldon: Yes.\nRaj: No. It\u2019s too Brobdingnagian.\nSheldon: Why do you even want this here? Its size is completely disproportionate to its purpose.\nRaj: Well, seeing as its purpose was to piss you off, I\u2019d say it\u2019s spot-on.\nSheldon: All right, I see what\u2019s going on. This is the opening salvo in what will be an escalating series of juvenile tit-for-tat exchanges. Well titted.\nRaj: Thank you.\nSheldon: Stand by for my upcoming tat.\nRaj: Hey, Sheldon?\nSheldon: Yes?\nRaj: No. See what I did there? I turned it around.\nScene: The Cheesecake Factory\nBernadette: Sorry, I had to clock out.\nHoward: Oh, no, that\u2019s okay. How have you been?\nBernadette: Okay. You know, busy, school, work. You?\nHoward: Same. I took a scuba-diving course over the summer, but it turns out I\u2019m terrified of the ocean.\nBernadette: Too bad.\nHoward: You wouldn\u2019t know anybody who wants to buy a wet suit, boy\u2019s large? Yeah, forget it. Not important. So, are you seeing anyone?\nBernadette: Well, to be honest, I\u2026\nPenny: Hey, how are we doing over here? Can I get you something to drink?\nHoward: Not for me, thanks.\nBernadette: I\u2019m okay.\nPenny: Are you gonna want to order food?\nHoward: Maybe later.\nPenny: Okay.\nHoward: So, are you seeing anybody?\nBernadette: No.\nPenny: That\u2019s what I told him when he asked me. I hope that\u2019s not out of line.\nBernadette: No, it\u2019s fine.\nHoward: Penny, can we have a little privacy?\nPenny: Oh. I\u2019m sorry.\nBernadette: What about you, have you been seeing anybody?\nHoward: Well, you know how it is with guys. I mean, we have needs and\u2026\nBernadette: So you\u2019ve been seeing other girls?\nHoward: Well, not real girls.\nBernadette: Does that mean slutty trolls?\nPenny: You know, you look thirsty. I brought you some iced tea.\nBernadette: Thank you.\nPenny: It\u2019s passion fruit, new on the menu.\nBernadette: I know. I work here.\nPenny: Oh, sorry. Yeah, you\u2019re right. Doy. So, Howard, trolls, yay or nay?\nHoward: Isn\u2019t there somewhere else you can be?\nPenny: Not where I can hear you guys.\nHoward: Okay, fine. I\u2019ll admit, there are dark, sordid little corners of the Internet where the name Wolowizard is whispered in hushed tones. But the only reason I go there, the only reason I\u2019ve ever gone there is because I don\u2019t have a real woman in my life. You happy?\nPenny: Yeah, that\u2019ll hold me for a while.\nBernadette: Howard, you did have a real woman. I was right there in the next room while you were clicking that troll\u2019s brains out.\nHoward: Yeah, but we weren\u2019t, I-I mean, you and I never\u2026\nBernadette: Had sex?\nHoward: Yeah.\nBernadette: Well, whose fault was that?\nPenny: Complimentary nachos! You enjoy. Never had sex? Wow.\nHoward: What do you mean, whose fault was that?\nBernadette: Well, we could\u2019ve been having sex, but you never made the move.\nHoward: I didn\u2019t think you wanted me to make the move.\nBernadette: Howard, a girl doesn\u2019t go out with a man like you, with your looks, your fancy patter and your tight hoochie pants if she\u2019s not expecting him to eventually make the move.\nHoward: Really?\nBernadette: Really.\nHoward: Son of a bitch.\nPenny: Hey, this is a little awkward, but my manager says I can\u2019t actually give nachos away. So, just take that when you\u2019re ready.\nScene: University corridor.\nHoward: Yeah, we had a really great talk, and we\u2019re gonna start seeing each other again.\nLeonard: Oh, congratulations. Have you broken it to the troll yet?\nHoward: Did Penny tell you about that?\nLeonard: No. Steve Patterson told me.\nHoward: The greasy old fat guy in Facilities Management?\nLeonard: Yeah.\nHoward: How\u2019d he know about it?\nLeonard: He\u2019s Glissinda the troll.\nRaj (voice): Sorry, dude, the thermostat\u2019s on my side of the room, so it stays Mumbai hot in here until you turn off that stupid Indian music!\nSheldon (voice): I\u2019ll turn off the music when you get rid of that salmonella-ridden parakeet!\nRaj (voice): Oh, too bad! Sheldon\u2019s pathologically afraid of birds! Hey, look, Sheldon! Birdie, birdie, birdie!\nSheldon (voice): That\u2019s it! Prepare for marshmallow death!\nRaj (voice): Eat flaming Nerf! (Imitates gunfire)\nLeonard: So anyway, that\u2019s great news about you and Bernadette.\nHoward: Yeah. I think I\u2019m gonna take her to miniature golf.\nLeonard: Ah. Well, I guess for you guys that\u2019s like regular golf.\nHoward: Short jokes? Really? You\u2019re, like, a quarter of an inch taller than me.\nLeonard: Yeah, and don\u2019t you forget it.\nScene: Bernadette\u2019s car. \nHoward: I had a good time.\nBernadette: Me, too.\nKatee Sackhoff: Kiss her good night. All right, now a little tongue.\nGeorge Takei: Hold on there. We\u2019ve only just rekindled the romance. Let\u2019s not sully the moment with the exchange of saliva.\nKatee Sackhoff: Don\u2019t listen to him. She wants it. Tongue. Luh-luh-luh-luh-luh. See? Now make the move.\nGeorge Takei: Mm-mmm. Too soon.\nKatee Sackhoff: Trust me, she\u2019s ready. Make the move.\nGeorge Takei: No, no, no. A lady wants to be wooed, courted slowly.\nKatee Sackhoff: How would you know?\nGeorge Takei: I read.\nKatee Sackhoff: Listen to me, Howard, it\u2019s time. Make the move, now.\nBernadette: Mm! What are you doing?\nHoward: You said, well, the move, remember?\nBernadette: Oh, not now. We\u2019re starting a new relationship. I need to get to know you again.\nHoward: No, you don\u2019t. It\u2019s me. The lusty charmer with the fancy patter and the hoochie pants.\nBernadette: Be patient, we\u2019ll get there.\nGeorge Takei: Told you.\nScene: University corridor. \nLeonard: Oh, God, what\u2019s that smell? (Knocks on Sheldon\u2019s door. Sheldon answers in a gas mask). Oh-ho-hoo!\nSheldon: Yes?\nLeonard: What are you doing in there?\nSheldon: I\u2019m making hydrogen sulphide and ammonia gas. Just a little experiment in pest control.\nRaj: It\u2019s not gonna work, dude, I grew up in India, an entire subcontinent where cows walk in the street, and nobody has ever had a solid bowel movement.\nSheldon: Well, we\u2019ll just see how long you can hold out.\nRaj: Well, we\u2019ll just see how your noxious gas fares against my cinnamon-apple-scented aroma therapy candles.\nLeonard: Didn\u2019t you say you\u2019re making hydrogen sulphide gas?\nSheldon: Yes.\nLeonard: Isn\u2019t that flammable?\nSheldon: Highly.

Well done.\nPenny: Yeah, and when I dropped her off at the hotel, she even gave me a hug.\nLeonard: Did she think you were choking or\u2026 I\u2019m sorry, that\u2019s great. Thank you for spending time with her.\nPenny: No problem. Um, so listen, I don\u2019t know if you have any plans next weekend, but I kind of promised your mom we\u2019d have another wedding ceremony so she could attend this time.\nLeonard: Wait, we\u2019re gonna get married again?\nPenny: Yeah, kind of, but now we can invite our friends and family.\nLeonard: Seems like a lot of trouble for a hug.\nPenny: Come on, it\u2019ll be fun, and, you know, your mom was genuinely hurt we didn\u2019t invite her to the first one.\nLeonard: Look, in our defence, it was kind of a spur of the moment thing, and also, we don\u2019t like her.\nPenny: Leonard, come on, she\u2019s your mom. If we can do something to make her happy, why wouldn\u2019t we?\nLeonard: I just said why, we don\u2019t like her.\nPenny: Hey, look, then forget about her, let\u2019s do it for us. We could keep it small and informal. This time we can invite our families.\nLeonard: Is your brother out of prison?\nPenny: Thanks to overcrowding, yeah.\nLeonard: I\u2019d love it if my dad could come.\nPenny: Oh, you have to invite him. I haven\u2019t seen him since the divorce.\nLeonard: Oh, he\u2019s like a different man. He stopped twitching, and I think he grew an inch and a half.\nPenny: Well, then it\u2019s settled. Yay. So funny. I never thought my second marriage would be to you.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The apartment.\nPenny: Okay, so it\u2019s not a legal ceremony, it\u2019s just a chance for us to redo our vows so everyone can be part of it.\nAmy: So there\u2019s no maid of honour?\nPenny: No.\nAmy: Huh. But if I were to, say, wear a purple satin dress with a sweetheart neckline and stand near you, you wouldn\u2019t be able to stop me, right?\nPenny: I don\u2019t see how I could.\nAmy: Then I graciously accept.\nBernadette: Who\u2019s going to officiate?\nPenny: I was kind of hoping you would.\nAmy: Wait, now I\u2019m just some lousy maid of honour?\nSheldon: Hey, good news, I just got off the phone with my mother. She is coming to the wedding.\nPenny: Okay, wait, you\u2019re inviting people to our wedding?\nSheldon: Yes, I\u2019m inviting people to our wedding. Yeah, I\u2019ve already asked Stephen Hawking and Robert Downey Jr, and, now don\u2019t get your hopes up, \u2019cause he\u2019s pretty busy, but Erno Rubik.\nBernadette: Who\u2019s Erno Rubik?\nSheldon: Seriously? He invented the Rubik\u2019s Cube.\nPenny: Okay, fine, but why would you invite him to our wedding?\nSheldon: Because, despite his fame and fortune, he strikes me as a lonely man.\nBernadette: Well, it\u2019s very sweet of you to go to all this trouble for Leonard\u2019s mother.\nPenny: Yeah, I\u2019m also doing it for Leonard. I think this could really help their relationship.\nScene: Leonard\u2019s car.\nBeverly: How dare you invite your father without consulting me.\nLeonard: Sorry, but I don\u2019t think I need your permission to have my father at my wedding.\nBeverly: You do understand our marriage ended because he had an affair.\nLeonard: I know, and there\u2019s no excuse for that.\nBeverly: He claimed I was cold, emasculating, and hadn\u2019t shown him any physical affection for years.\nLeonard: I was wrong, there\u2019s three excuses for that.\nScene: Howard\u2019s workshop.\nHoward: Oh, my God. It\u2019s working.\nRaj: You sure?\nHoward: Look. The system is maintaining its own stability, the quantum vortex apparatus is now controlling the orientation.\nRaj: You\u2019re right. You realize what this means?\nHoward: Yeah. I do. It\u2019s proof of concept. We\u2019ve got a workable guidance system.\nRaj: Congratulations.\nHoward: Thanks. Hey, I just got an e-mail from the U.S. Air Force.\nRaj: Open it.\nHoward: Hmm. We request a meeting at your earliest convenience regarding your quantum guidance system, provisional patent 62/295118. That\u2019s weird.\nRaj: Is there a window around here we don\u2019t know about?\nHoward: I\u2019m sure it\u2019s just a coincidence.\nRaj: Yeah, of course. What else could it be? Boy, do I love America.\nScene: Amy\u2019s car.\nMary Cooper: Thank you for picking me up.\nSheldon: Oh, you\u2019re welcome.\nMary: I was speaking to your young lady.\nAmy: My pleasure, Mrs. Cooper.\nMary: Oh, please call me Mary.\nAmy: Okay, Mary.\nSheldon: You know, that doesn\u2019t work for me, let\u2019s stay with Mrs. Cooper.\nMary: Sheldon, don\u2019t be silly.\nSheldon: Wu-wu, what? That\u2019s what I called you till I got to know you better.\nMary: It was so nice of Leonard and Penny to invite me.\nSheldon: Well, actually, I\u2026\nAmy: It sure was.\nMary: I\u2019ve always had a special place in my heart for Leonard. Taking care of my baby all these years.\nSheldon: Excuse me, I take care of him.\nMary: Sure you do. So who else is coming to this shindig?\nAmy: Oh, well, the usual gang. Penny\u2019s family is coming tomorrow.\nSheldon: Yeah, and Leonard\u2019s mother\u2019s already here.\nMary: Oh, Beverly. How nice.\nAmy: You\u2019ve met her, right?\nMary: Yes, I have.\nSheldon: Mother, she\u2019s an atheist, not a vampire.\nMary: Either way, let\u2019s stop and get some garlic.\nScene: The apartment.\nBeverly: So, Mary, how have you been?\nMary: Well, thank you so much for asking. I\u2019ve been well, and you?\nBeverly: Very good.\nMary: Good.\nSheldon: I don\u2019t know what we were worried about, they\u2019re getting along great.\nMary: Sheldon tells me your husband\u2019s coming.\nBeverly: My ex-husband.\nMary: Oh, I\u2019m so sorry.\nBeverly: Don\u2019t be.\nMary: All right.\nPenny: Whew, chilly.\nAmy: I think I can see my breath.\nBeverly: We can hear you.\nPenny: Sorry.\nAmy: Sorry.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s kitchen.\nHoward: I can\u2019t believe I was so naive. The military is just gonna take over the whole project. And you know what happens if we object? We disappear. Like off the map. Like every American Idol winner since season four.\nBernadette: Come on, Howard, you\u2019re overreacting.\nHoward: Am I? Am I? What, what do you want to bet some black ops guy is reprinting my high school yearbook and I\u2019m no longer in it? That chess club picture is now just David Zimmerman and Elaine Cho.\nRaj: Okay, look, I\u2019m on the Air Force Web site, and the department that e-mailed you is in charge of acquisitions. So maybe they just want to give you a lot of money for your invention.\nHoward: Oh, please, that\u2019s not how it works. You saw E.T., Avatar, Jurassic World. The military just shows up and takes over.\nBernadette: You do realize those weren\u2019t documentaries, right?\nHoward: I\u2019m sorry, you find this funny?\nRaj: No, I was just thinking about Jurassic World. Boy, that was terrible.\nScene: The foyer.\nLeonard: Oh, we have to use the stairs.\nAlfred Hofstadter: When are they gonna fix your elevator?\nLeonard: Uh, I don\u2019t, any day now.\nAlfred: Well, the stairs are fine. Besides, your mother is up there. Maybe I\u2019ll have a heart attack and not have to see her.\nLeonard: Hey, I, I know things are a little rough with you and Mom, but I\u2019m really glad you\u2019re here.\nAlfred: Me, too. I should have never had that angioplasty because I feel fine.\nLeonard: Penny\u2019s really looking forward to seeing you.\nAlfred: Ah, she\u2019s a sweetie. You got a good one there, Leonard.\nLeonard: Thanks, Dad.\nAlfred: How the hell did you do that?\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Isn\u2019t this nice?\nLeonard: Hey, we\u2019re here.\nPenny: Alfred. Thank you for coming!\nAlfred: Oh. Well, happy to be here. And congratulations.\nPenny: Thank you.\nLeonard: Dad, you remember Sheldon.\nSheldon: Dr. Hofstadter.\nAlfred: Dr. Cooper.\nLeonard: This is Sheldon\u2019s mother, Mary.\nAlfred: How do you do?\nMary: Nice to meet you.\nLeonard: And his girlfriend, Amy.\nAlfred: A pleasure.\nAmy: Hi.\nLeonard: And, of course, Mom.\nAlfred: Hello, my hateful shrew.\nBeverly: Hello to you, you wrinkled old bastard.\nSheldon: All right, now I\u2019m starting to sense a little tension.\nLeonard: All right, you two, don\u2019t start. Penny and I are throwing this second wedding for your benefit. Can you please not ruin it?\nAlfred: Of course. I\u2019m sorry.\nBeverly: Oh, look at that, you can apologize.\nLeonard: Mom.\nBeverly: I\u2019m sorry.\nMary: You know, the Bible says forgiveness\u2026\nSheldon: Mom.\nMary: I\u2019m sorry.\nPenny: Uh, who\u2019s hungry? We have a reservation at the best restaurant in town.\nSheldon: It only got three-and-a-half stars on Yelp.\nAmy: Sheldon.\nSheldon: I\u2019m not sorry. That\u2019s true.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s kitchen.\nHoward: I don\u2019t know what to do. It\u2019s the Air Force. I mean, should I respond to their e-mail? Ignore it?\nRaj: You can\u2019t ignore it. It\u2019s not that postcard that says it\u2019s time to go back to the dentist.\nBernadette: Guys, come on. We\u2019re meeting everyone for dinner.\nHoward: One sec. I\u2019m just afraid if I respond, then they\u2019ll know I got it.\nRaj: Oh, dude. The minute you opened that e-mail, they knew you got it. I mean, they\u2019re probably looking at you through the camera right now. I love America.\nBernadette: Are you done with this nonsense?\nHoward: It\u2019s not nonsense. This is how the U.S. military works.\nRaj: Oh, if it\u2019s even the U.S. Military. It could be foreign military pretending to be American.\nHoward: You\u2019re right. We turn our guidance system over to them, next thing we know, they\u2019re using it against us.\nRaj: I also love the enemies of America.\nScene: Leonard\u2019s car.\nBeverly: Penny, I hope the example of my failed marriage to Leonard\u2019s father doesn\u2019t discourage you from the commitment you\u2019ve made to one another.\nPenny: No, of course not.\nBeverly: Although Alfred and I had a lot more going for us than you two.\nLeonard: Mom, please save something for the toast.\nScene: Amy\u2019s car.\nMary: So, Alfred, what is it that you do for a living?\nAlfred: Oh, I\u2019m an anthropologist. I study ancient peoples and cultures.\nMary: My goodness, so all the way back to the Flood.\nSheldon: Don\u2019t laugh, she wasn\u2019t joking.\nAmy: Play with your phone.\nAlfred: Well, on that note, there are many cultures that have an apocalyptic flood as part of their mythology.\nMary: I don\u2019t have a mythology. I have the unerring Word of God. But that\u2019s very interesting.\nAlfred: Oh. I, I didn\u2019t mean to disparage your faith. Actually, I admire it.\nMary: Really?\nAlfred: Yes. Yes, I\u2019m an agnostic myself, but I have prayed, many times, to God, to turn my wife into a pillar of salt.\nMary: Well, He came close. Turned her into a giant block of ice.\nScene: Howard\u2019s car.\nRaj: Howard, there must be someone at the university you can go to for help.\nHoward: Are you kidding? They\u2019re probably the ones who leaked it to the military in the first place.\nRaj: What about the guy on the Channel Four News? You know, Four on Your Side? Maybe he can be on your side.\nHoward: I\u2019m being harassed by the government, not trying to get to the bottom of a dog-walking scam.\nBernadette: Oh, stop. You know what\u2019s really happening? All the movies you\u2019ve watched, the TV shows, the comic books, they\u2019ve completely twisted your thinking. No one\u2019s after you, no one\u2019s listening to you, no one cares about you.\nRaj: I\u2019d like to think the Four on Your Side guy cares about me.\nScene: Leonard\u2019s car.\nPenny: You know, Beverly, I know you and Alfred have your differences, but if you think about it, if you hadn\u2019t married him, there\u2019d be no Leonard. So that\u2019s good, right?\nBeverly: Yeah.\nLeonard: Is that Howard in front of us?\nPenny: Oh, maybe. Get closer.\nHoward\u2019s car.\nHoward: Oh, God. I think someone\u2019s following us.\nBernadette: You\u2019re being ridiculous.\nHoward: I\u2019m not being ridiculous, he\u2019s right on my tail.\nRaj: Uh, turn left here and see if he turns with us.\nLeonard\u2019s car.\nPenny: Well, why is he turning here? The restaurant\u2019s the other way.\nLeonard: I don\u2019t know. He uses that traffic app. Maybe there\u2019s an accident.\nPenny: Oh, so follow him.\nHoward\u2019s car.\nRaj: Oh, no.\nHoward: I told you.\nBernadette: It\u2019s probably just a coincidence. Speed up a little, see if he stays with you.\nLeonard\u2019s car.\nPenny: Well, go faster. You\u2019re losing him.\nLeonard: What is his hurry?\nPenny: You know what, flash your lights. Let him know it\u2019s you.\nHoward\u2019s car.\nHoward: He\u2019s flashing his lights. What\u2019s that mean?\nRaj: I, I think he wants us to pull over.\nBernadette: Do not pull over. I\u2019m not raising this baby alone.\nHoward: Hang on.\nScene: The restaurant.\nAlfred: So, after your husband passed, you never remarried?\nMary: No, just focused on work and the church.\nAlfred: Ah. And what do you do?\nMary: I work at the church.\nAlfred: Well, they\u2019re lucky to have you.\nMary: Well, thank you.\nAlfred: You\u2019re welcome.\nAmy: Do you realize what\u2019s happening here?\nSheldon: Yeah, I do. They\u2019re filling up on bread and ruining their meal.\nLeonard: Hey.\nPenny: Hey.\nAmy: What took you guys so long?\nLeonard: Oh, we were following Howard, but for some reason, he turned off his headlights and went up a one-way street.\nPenny: So, what did we miss?\nAlfred: Oh, just Mary and I getting to know each other a little.\nMary: Leonard, your father is just charming.\nBeverly: He\u2019s also broke. Did he mention that?\nLeonard: Okay, Mom, you sit over there.\nPenny: Yeah, I\u2019m gonna call Bernadette and see what\u2019s keeping them.\nSheldon: If I\u2019d known you were broke, I wouldn\u2019t have made a big deal about the bread.\nScene: Howard\u2019s car.\nBernadette (on phone): Hey, Penny. What are you talking about? Oh, that was you? Long story. Why don\u2019t you go ahead and eat. We\u2019re gonna be a while.\nHoward: I\u2019m telling you, I\u2019m not on drugs. The government\u2019s out to get me.\nScene: The restaurant.\nAlfred: Now, one of the more exciting things to be found recently is that Neanderthals and Homo Sapiens frequently mated with each other.\nMary: Well, that certainly explains my marriage to Sheldon\u2019s father.\nSheldon: That\u2019s funny, because my father was not a very clever man.\nAmy: I\u2019d be lost without you.\nLeonard: Uh, I would like to propose a toast to my wife and bride-to-be.\nSheldon: See, that\u2019s funny because\u2026\nAmy: Back to your phone.\nLeonard: Penny, I\u2019ve always known I loved you, but this last year has shown me that I also love being married to you. Thank you for saying yes.\nPenny: Oh, thanks for asking until I did.\nAmy: Hear, hear.\nLeonard: Cheers.\nAlfred: I, uh, I would also like to make a toast.\nPenny: Aw.\nAlfred: Leonard, I am so happy that you have found a woman who loves and cares for you.\nBeverly: What the hell is that supposed to mean?\nAlfred: Why don\u2019t you take a pill?\nBeverly: Like you did before sex?\nAlfred: What I really needed was a blindfold.\nMary: All right, everyone, calm down. Let\u2019s all remember what it says in the Bible: He who is slow to anger is better than the mighty.\nBeverly: Oh, dear woman, can you please read another book?\nMary: When God writes one, I will.\nPenny: Um, if, if we want to order the souffl\u00e9, we might want to get on that.\nAlfred: Leonard, if you don\u2019t mind, I, I think I\u2019m a little tired. I\u2019m gonna call it a night.\nLeonard: Sure, Dad.\nMary: I\u2019m a little tuckered out myself, so I will see you all in the morning.\nAlfred: Would you like to share a cab?\nMary: That would be fine.\nAlfred: Where are you staying?\nMary: I\u2019m at the Westin.\nAlfred: Oh, so am I. Can I interest you in a nightcap?\nMary: I think that you could.\nLeonard: What is happening there?\nSheldon: I think it\u2019s pretty obvious. They don\u2019t want dessert \u2019cause they filled up on bread.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: She\u2019s still not answering.\nLeonard: My father\u2019s not texting me back.\nPenny: \u2018Cause they both turned their phones off.\nSheldon: I don\u2019t like this at all.\nLeonard: I don\u2019t like it either.\nPenny: Really? \u2018Cause I love it.\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "7_22": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Gentlemen, Star Wars Day is rapidly approaching. We should finalize our plans.\nPenny: What? That\u2019s a real thing? What is it, Star Wars Christmas?\nHoward: No. Don\u2019t be ridiculous. That\u2019s Wookiee Life Day.\nPenny: So, when is it?\nLeonard: Uh, well, it\u2019s not May the fifth, and it\u2019s not May the third. It\u2019s May the fourth.\nSheldon: Get it?\nRaj: May the fourth be with you?\nLeonard: May the force be with you. Get it?\nPenny: Oh, no. This face wasn\u2019t because I didn\u2019t get it.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: Sheldon\u2019s bedroom. There is a knock on the door.\nSheldon: Come in.\nLeonard: Hey, you got a second?\nSheldon: Yes. Actually, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re here. I\u2019m working on the Star Wars Day schedule. Now, I have a window built in after Phantom Menace for complaining, but I\u2019m worried an hour won\u2019t be enough time.\nLeonard: Sheldon, I\u2019ve got some bad news.\nSheldon: What is it?\nLeonard: I just read online that Arthur Jeffries passed away.\nSheldon: Professor Proton is dead?\nLeonard: Sorry, buddy.\nSheldon: What are you doing?\nLeonard: Comforting you?\nSheldon: Your heart might be in the right place, but your head, chest and arms certainly aren\u2019t.\nLeonard: Anyway, the, the funeral\u2019s on Sunday.\nSheldon: But, that\u2019s Star Wars Day.\nLeonard: Yeah, um, of all the things about this that are sad, that might not be number one. You okay? I know he meant a lot to you.\nSheldon: I\u2019m fine.\nLeonard: Okay. Yet he cried when they changed the Raisin Bran box.\nScene: Amy\u2019s apartment. \nProfessor Proton (on youtube): This, uh, this is something interesting boys and girls. After an owl eats, he spits up part of his meal that he can\u2019t digest, in the form of a pellet. Is, isn\u2019t that a hoot? We\u2019ll be right back after I fire my writers. (Owl hoots) Oh, shut up.\nAmy: Watching your old friend?\nSheldon: Hmm. Yes. Look at him, Amy. It\u2019s such a shame. Struck down in the prime of my life.\nAmy: Do you want me to go to the funeral with you?\nSheldon: Oh, I\u2019m not going to the funeral.\nAmy: Why not?\nSheldon: All those people blowing their noses. You can\u2019t tell the sick from the sad. Mm. I\u2019ll be at home celebrating Star Wars Day, as planned.\nAmy: Are you sure you don\u2019t want to go say good-bye?\nSheldon: Amy, mourning the inevitable is a complete waste of time.\nAmy: And watching a bunch of goofy space movies you\u2019ve seen hundreds of times isn\u2019t?\nSheldon: If we were in a physical relationship, you just lost sex tonight.\nScene: The apartment.\nPenny: Hey, guys.\nRaj: Hey, Penny. Happy Star Wars Day.\nPenny: Okay.\nRaj: Can I make you breakfast? Admiral Ackbar\u2019s Snack Bar is open for business.\nPenny: No, thanks. Leonard and I are just going to the funeral.\nHoward: You sure. Not even coffee? We have R2-Decaf. Maybe a nice Cafe Au Leia?\nRaj: And if you\u2019re not in the mood for coffee I can always make you a Chai Tea-3PO.\nPenny: Oh, I get it, like C3PO. What happened to me?\nRaj: Hey, uh, Sheldon, you want anything?\nSheldon: Uh, no, thank you.\nHoward: You\u2019re being so quiet. Are you upset or are you just rebooting?\nSheldon: I\u2019m fine.\nPenny: Sweetie, are you sure you don\u2019t want to come with us to the funeral?\nSheldon: Oh, I appreciate the offer, but Arthur is gone and there\u2019s nothing I can do about it. When Darth Vader struck down Obi-Wan, did Luke cry like a baby and go to his funeral?\nPenny: No, he blew up the Death Star. Why do I know this?\nSheldon: Arthur Jeffries was a scientist. I\u2019m sure he didn\u2019t care about silly superstitions like funerals. You know, if he were here, I think he\u2019d say enjoy Star Wars Day.\nLeonard: He was 84, he\u2019d say where\u2019s my pudding?\nRaj: Before you go, at least let me pack you some Attack of the Scones for the road.\nPenny: Oh, like Attack of the Clones. We are leaving right now.\nScene: Amy\u201ds apartment. \nAmy: Arthur passing away was harder on Sheldon than he\u2019s ready to admit. Really hoping this will cheer him up.\nBernadette: Me, too. Although, it might\u2019ve been thoughtless of us to bake a Death Star cake.\nAmy: No, it combines two of Sheldon\u2019s favorite things, chocolate chips and the ability to destroy a planet at the push of a button.\nBernadette: Well, anyway, it\u2019ll be a nice surprise for the boys. And Howie doesn\u2019t think I take his interests seriously, so hopefully this will keep him fooled for a while.\nAmy: Okay, let\u2019s get the fondant and start decorating.\nBernadette: This is pretty cool. You don\u2019t see too many spherical cakes.\nAmy: I wonder why that is.\nScene: The funeral.\nPenny: I have a confession to make.\nLeonard: Hmm?\nPenny: I\u2019ve never been to a funeral before.\nLeonard: Really?\nPenny: I just never knew anyone that died. I had a pet pig when I was a kid. I mean, when he died, we didn\u2019t have a funeral, we had a barbecue.\nLeonard: Yeah, we won\u2019t be eating Arthur tonight.\nPenny: I didn\u2019t know him very well, but I still really liked him. It\u2019s weird that he\u2019s just gone.\nLeonard: I know.\nPenny: I feel like I want to cry.\nLeonard: Oh that\u2019s, that\u2019s fine. Go ahead.\nPenny: I can\u2019t do it with you staring at me.\nLeonard: Sorry.\nPenny: No, I\u2019m dry. You\u2019re a big crybaby, you start, I\u2019ll join in.\nLeonard: I am not a crybaby.\nPenny: Toy Story 3?\nLeonard: The toys were holding hands in a furnace. Look, Arthur lived a full life. And he inspired a lot of people. Sure, he, he was my childhood hero, but the fact that I got to work with him, side by side, before he died was, it was, it was a gift.\nPenny: It was a gift. Thank you for being the emotional one in this relationship.\nLeonard: I got your back.\nPenny: Yeah.\nScene: The apartment. \nSheldon: Okay, here we go. Episode I: The Phantom Menace.\nRaj: Ugh, let\u2019s get this over with.\nHoward: Since we all agree Episode I isn\u2019t our favourite, maybe we just skip it this time.\nSheldon: Howard, I think you of all people should avoid espousing the principle that if something is not our favourite we should just get rid of it.\nRaj: You know, I heard of this way of watching the movies called the Machete Order, where you watch Episodes IV and V, then skip Episode I, watch II and III as a flashback, and then finish with VI.\nHoward: Okay, so you\u2019d lose most of Jar Jar, all the trade route talk and the boring senate hearings, which are like watching C-SPAN with monsters.\nSheldon: Get rid of the trade route part? Then how would Palpatine get Chancellor Valorum kicked out of office? How would he get himself elected? How? Can we get through one holiday without you saying something ridiculous?\nRaj: It was just a suggestion.\nSheldon: Well, you know what else was just a suggestion? Why don\u2019t we change the Raisin Bran box? Hmm? And you know who got hurt by that? Every single person who eats breakfast.\nRaj: Wow.\nHoward: I think he\u2019s taking this Professor Proton thing pretty hard.\nRaj: Should we try to console him?\nHoward: Or should we respect his privacy in this moment of grief?\nRaj: By staying here and watching the movie.\nHoward: That\u2019s what good friends would do.\nScene: Later.\nHoward: Well, at least without Sheldon here, we got to start with Episode IV.\nRaj: Mm, true. I do feel guilty about him.\nHoward: Me, too.\nRaj: Maybe we should see how he\u2019s doing.\nHoward: Yeah.\nRaj: But after the cantina scene.\nHoward: Obviously.\nScene: Sheldon, dreaming he is in the living room of the apartment on his laptop.\nSheldon: Look at Arthur, cracking up at a joke I told him. I\u2019ll never hear that laugh again.\nArthur: You never heard it that time.\nSheldon: Arthur. I thought you were dead.\nArthur: I am. Oh, it, it\u2019s fantastic. I mean this, this is the longest that I\u2019ve gone without running into a men\u2019s room in, in, in years.\nSheldon: Why are you here?\nArthur: I don\u2019t know. I was, I was hoping I was going to haunt my ex-wife.\nSheldon: I know why. You\u2019ve come to me because you\u2019re my Obi-Wan.\nArthur: I\u2019m, I\u2019m not, I\u2019m not familiar with that. Is, is, is that an, an Internet?\nSheldon: Wow. Uh, you\u2019re dead, so I\u2019m going to let that slide. Obi-Wan Kenobi is a character from Star Wars. After his physical demise, he comes to Luke Skywalker as his mentor in spirit form.\nArthur: Well, that, that clears that up.\nSheldon: You must be here to give me advice.\nArthur: Well, this, this is weird. Most, most of my robes open in, in the back.\nSheldon: Those are your Jedi robes.\nArthur: Oh, wait. What, what, what is, what is this?\nSheldon: Be careful with that.\nArthur: Oh. Oh. Oh, neato. I\u2019m, uh, I\u2019m going to need a Band-Aid.\nScene: The funeral.\nLeonard: So, what did you think of your first funeral?\nPenny: Well, I don\u2019t want to be a jerk, but it was kind of a bummer.\nLeonard: Yeah, well, when I die, you can rent a bounce house.\nPenny: You think about dying?\nLeonard: Mm. Well, I think more about if I\u2019d have any regrets.\nPenny: What would you regret?\nLeonard: Mm, you know, that I didn\u2019t travel more, take more risks, learn another language.\nPenny: You know Klingon.\nLeonard: That\u2019s true.\nPenny: No, I meant that as a regret.\nLeonard: I just thought of one more.\nPenny: What\u2019s that?\nLeonard: I regret not saying yes when you asked me to marry you.\nPenny: Well, it just wasn\u2019t the right time.\nLeonard: Yeah.\nPenny: And this is also not the right time. Do not propose.\nLeonard: What?\nPenny: I know that face. That\u2019s your propose face.\nLeonard: I was not gonna propose. It\u2019s already two to one.\nPenny: What\u2019s two to one?\nLeonard: I proposed twice, you proposed once. Two to one.\nPenny: Oh, my. It\u2019s not a contest.\nLeonard: I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re upset about. I\u2019m the one who\u2019s losing.\nPenny: Okay. Fine. Would you feel better if I propose so you could turn me down again?\nLeonard: Yeah, I think I would.\nPenny: Okay. Leonard, will you marry me?\nLeonard: Hmm.\nPenny: No, don\u2019t you dare. You reject me right now and tie things up.\nLeonard: It\u2019s just such a big decision. I don\u2019t want to have any regrets.\nScene: Amy\u2019s apartment.\nAmy: Did you ever watch Professor Proton when you were a kid?\nBernadette: No. My dad controlled the TV, so unless someone was a Texas Ranger, Jake or the Fatman, we didn\u2019t see it.\nAmy: I never watched him, either, but he seems to be the reason that Sheldon got interested in science.\nBernadette: Not me. I got into science \u2019cause I was always the smallest kid in school, so I thought if I became a scientist, I could invent a formula that made me taller.\nAmy: That\u2019s cute.\nBernadette: Yeah, I thought it was working for a while, but then I found out my brother was just lowering the pencil marks on the door frame. How about you?\nAmy: Oh, I guess it must have been back when I was in the Girl Sprouts.\nBernadette: Girl Sprouts?\nAmy: My mom made it up as an alternative to the Girl Scouts. She didn\u2019t want me selling cookies on some street corner like a whore.\nBernadette: How did that get you into science?\nAmy: Oh, I went to the library and took out a book on biology to see what whores did.\nScene: Leonard\u2019s car.\nLeonard: On the one hand, if I say yes\u2026\nPenny: This isn\u2019t funny anymore. Just say no so we\u2019re done with this. Will you marry me or not?\nLeonard: Ooh, interesting. Did you just propose to me again?\nPenny: No.\nLeonard: Really? Because I just heard will you marry me? That\u2019s two proposals, one day. Sounds like someone wants to spend the rest of her life telling people how to spell the name Hofstadter.\nPenny: You know what? Fine. Do whatever you want.\nLeonard: Hey. Penny, don\u2019t get upset. Here. I love you, but, no, I will not marry you.\nPenny: Thank you.\nLeonard: Now, about that second proposal. On the one hand\u2026\nScene: Sheldon\u2019s dream.\nArthur: Where, where, where are we?\nSheldon: This is the swampland of Dagobah. It\u2019s where Luke was trained in the ways of the Jedi.\nArthur: Oh. Too bad. I thought it was Florida.\nSheldon: When Obi-Wan came to Luke on this very spot, he gave him all sorts of helpful advice. So, um, what do you got for me?\nArthur: Um, always, get, get a prenup.\nSheldon: That\u2019s it? I thought there\u2019d be more of a reason why you\u2019re here.\nArthur: Well, why, why do you think I\u2019m here?\nSheldon: I suppose it has something to do with your recent passing.\nArthur: Is, is this the, the first time you\u2019ve lost, you know, someone close to you?\nSheldon: Oh, no. No. I\u2019ve already had to say good-bye to 11 Dr. Whos.\nArthur: Yeah, I\u2019ve, I\u2019ve outlived a few of my doctors, too.\nSheldon: Of course, my grandfather died when I was five. My father died when I was 14.\nArthur: I\u2019m, I\u2019m sorry about that.\nSheldon: And now you\u2019re gone, too. It\u2019s like all the men I\u2019ve looked up to have gone away.\nArthur: Well, you know, it\u2019s, it\u2019s okay to, to be sad about them. Just, just make sure, you know, you appreciate those who, who are still there for you.\nSheldon: But I do appreciate them.\nArthur: Well, then, what am I doing in a swamp dressed like Friar Tuck? Appreciate them, Sheldon. (Sheldon is woken up by a knocking on his bedroom door.)\nLeonard: Hey, buddy. Heard you\u2019re having a rough day. You all right?\nSheldon: I\u2019m okay. How was the funeral?\nLeonard: It was nice, you know. A lot of people showed up, told some great stories about him. Did you know that Arthur\u2019s son is a high school sci\u2026? (Sheldon hugs him) Hey, the guys are about to start Jedi. You want to go watch?\nSheldon: I do. After I make them go back and watch one through five first.\nLeonard: Sheldon, that, that\u2019ll take us all night.\nSheldon: That\u2019s true. Oh, it\u2019s a good thing I had a nap.\nScene: The apartment. \nHoward: Boy, some of the physical comedy with Jar Jar is a little tough to watch.\nLeonard: At least they toned him down in the second one.\nPenny: Yeah, he is pretty stupid.\nRaj: Hey, we can say it. You can\u2019t.\nAmy: Hey, guys.\nBernadette: Happy Star Wars Day.\nSheldon: Wow. A Death Star cake.\nAmy: Yeah. We were hoping it might cheer you up.\nBernadette: And even though it meant we had to miss the movies, we could still be part of the fun.\nHoward: Well, you didn\u2019t miss anything. We just started over.\nBernadette: Son of a bitch.\nScene: The same, everyone is falling asleep.\nSheldon: You\u2019re back.\nArthur: Yeah, apparently, um, I\u2019m here whenever, when, whenever you need me.\nSheldon: That\u2019s nice.\nArthur: May, maybe for you.\nSheldon: Why do I need you now?\nArthur: Well, as near as I could tell, you, you fell asleep watching Star Wars, and now you\u2019re, you\u2019re dreaming you\u2019re watching Star Wars.\nSheldon: So?\nArthur: I mean, don\u2019t, don\u2019t you see a problem there? I mean, how, how you\u2019re spending your limited time on Earth?\nSheldon: Not at all.\nArthur: Okay, good luck to you.\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "7_9": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: The math is all there. It\u2019s not real.\nPenny: Yes, it is.\nSheldon: Yeah,uh, look, it is scientifically impossible for a person to tip a cow. Even you, with your stocky build and lumberjack shoulders, you couldn\u2019t do it.\nRaj: It\u2019s horrible. Why would you push a cow over? They\u2019re sacred.\nPenny: Oh, stop it. I\u2019ve seen you eat, like, a million hamburgers.\nRaj: Hey, an animal can be both sacred and delicious.\nPenny: Look, I\u2019m telling you I\u2019ve done it, okay? I clearly remember the cow standing up and then the cow on its side.\nLeonard: Were you drunk?\nPenny: I was 16 in Nebraska. What do you think?\nLeonard: I think you\u2019re the one who fell over.\nPenny: That would explain why the sky was also on its side.\nHoward: Hey.\nPenny: Howard. Cow tipping. Real or not?\nHoward: Mmm. I\u2019m gonna say not. That\u2019s just based on me trying to roll my mom over when she\u2019s snoring. Speaking of that big side of beef, uh, she\u2019s invited all of you to Thanksgiving at her house.\nSheldon: Mmm. You know, I\u2019ve been told that a bald refusal of an invitation is rude and one must instead offer up a polite excuse, so I\u2019d love to go, but, unfortunately, that sounds awful.\nHoward: Come on, it\u2019ll be fun.\nPenny: Uh, we were actually gonna do it here.\nHoward: Please? Bernadette\u2019s bringing her dad \u2019cause her mom\u2019s out of town, and I never have anything to say to that guy.\nSheldon: Oh, since you put it that way, I\u2019d love to go, but that sounds even more awful.\nLeonard: It\u2019d actually be nice to not hear Sheldon complain about my cooking all day.\nSheldon: Uh, excuse me, but every year you prepare a terrible meal and every year I criticize it. Do our traditions mean nothing to you?\nLeonard: I want to go.\nPenny: Yeah, me, too.\nRaj: I\u2019m in.\nHoward: Sheldon.\nSheldon: Ugh, fine, I\u2019ll go. But if her food is delicious, Thanksgiving is ruined, and it\u2019s on you.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Do we really have to go to Mrs. Wolowitz\u2019s house?\nAmy: We do. And I expect you to be on your best behaviour.\nSheldon: Now I know how the African slaves felt. Being dragged from their homes to labour under the yoke of the white man.\nAmy: Are you honestly comparing Thanksgiving dinner at Wolowitz\u2019s mom\u2019s with one of the greatest tragedies in the history of mankind?\nSheldon: Yes.\nPenny: Sheldon, you can have a nice Thanksgiving anywhere. I spent one in Vegas.\nLeonard: You did?\nPenny: Yeah, back when I was dating Zack. It was actually more fun than I thought. We gambled, we went to one of those cheesy wedding chapels, we had a really good turkey dinner. Which was surprising, since we were at a strip club.\nLeonard: Wait, you went to a chapel?\nPenny: Yeah. \nLeonard: Why? \nPenny: We had one of those silly fake weddings.\nLeonard: Penny, you know those are real, right?\nPenny: No, they\u2019re not.\nLeonard: Yeah, they are.\nPenny: No, they\u2019re not.\nLeonard: Yeah, they are.\nSheldon: He\u2019s right.\nAmy: They\u2019re real.\nPenny: But it didn\u2019t seem real.\nSheldon: Let me ask you a question. At any point, was Las Vegas on its side?\nScene: Mrs Wolowitz\u2019s house.\nBernadette: Hi, Dad.\nMike: Hi, honey.\nBernadette: Oh, you brought beer for everybody.\nMike: Uh, okay, yeah, it\u2019s for everybody. I really just wanted to have a nice, quiet day at home and watch the game.\nBernadette: You can have a quiet day and watch the game here.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Howard, the medicine\u2019s not working.\nHoward (off): You just took it. At least let it reach your first stomach. (entering) Hey, Mike. Let me help you out, there.\nMike: Thanks. What\u2019s wrong with your mom?\nHoward: Oh, her gout\u2019s flaring up. Turns out an apple pie a day does not keep the doctor away.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): How can one little toe hurt so bad? \nHoward: Maybe because that little piggy is being crushed by the barn. She should quiet down soon. I gave her enough pain meds to choke a, well, her.\nBernadette: I guess we\u2019re gonna have to do all the cooking.\nHoward: I have a better idea.\nBernadette: If you think you\u2019re gonna make me do all this by myself, you\u2019re crazy.\nHoward: I was gonna make Raj do it all by himself.\nBernadette: Oh, well, that\u2019s a great idea.\nScene: Leonard\u2019s car. \nAmy: No traffic, we\u2019re sailing.\nSheldon: Yes. Like we\u2019re on a ship. Coming from Africa to America.\nAmy: Sheldon, that\u2019s completely inappropriate. You can\u2019t keep comparing yourself to a slave.\nSheldon: Yes, Miss Amy.\nLeonard: I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re married to that idiot.\nPenny: Ugh, would you stop? We just did it as a goof.\nLeonard: Well, a goof or not, you\u2019re actually married. You need to get this taken care of.\nPenny: I will. Why are you making this such a big deal?\nSheldon: Oh, oh, oh, I have a reason. It could be because you said yes to marrying Zack, but every time Leonard\u2019s proposed, he\u2019s gotten a resounding no. Yeah, that\u2019s just off the top of my head.\nPenny: So how do I undo this?\nLeonard: I\u2019m hoping you can get an annulment. It\u2019s just like it never happened.\nPenny: Great, well, what do I have to do?\nAmy: It says here you can get an annulment if any of the following conditions are met. Were you unable to consummate the marriage?\nSheldon: Hah!Penny? Next.\nAmy: Is there any evidence of fraud, bigamy, want of understanding?\nPenny: Want of understanding? What does that even mean?\nAmy: Ding, ding, ding. We have a winner.\nScene: Mrs Wolowitz\u2019s kitchen.\nBernadette: Thanks for saving the day.\nRaj: Ah, no problem. It wouldn\u2019t be Thanksgiving without an Indian providing the food. Uh, now, where does your mom keep the Crisco?\nHoward: Um, I don\u2019t know. Probably in a wad in her cheek.\nBernadette: I\u2019ll help Raj in here. Why don\u2019t you go keep my dad company?\nHoward: He doesn\u2019t want me in there. I\u2019m the creepy little guy who has sex with his daughter.\nBernadette: Don\u2019t be silly, he loves you.\nHoward: Does he?\nBernadette: Okay, he cares about you a lot.\nHoward: Really?\nScene: The living room.\nBernadette: I do crap for you all the time. Get out there.\nHoward: So your wife\u2019s in Arizona with the grandkids?\nMike: Uh-huh.\nHoward: You know, my mom\u2019s been to Arizona. She rode one of those mules down in the Grand Canyon. Long story short, they had to shoot it. \u2018Cause she\u2019s so fat. I\u2019ll get the door while you finish laughing. Hey, guys.\nAmy: Happy Thanksgiving.\nSheldon: It smells wonderful. Is anyone slaving away in the kitchen? Because I, too, know\u2026\nAmy: Sheldon.\nPenny: Here. Thank you for having us.\nHoward: What\u2019s with you?\nLeonard: Oh, she\u2019s mad at me because she just found out she\u2019s married to Zack.\nHoward: Really? That dumb-ass she used to date? That\u2019s hysterical.\nPenny: I can\u2019t believe I felt bad for opening this in the car.\nScene: The kitchen.\nAmy: You need any help?\nRaj: Uh, yeah, can you, uh, reach that, uh, gravy boat up there?\nAmy: Uh, sure.\nRaj: Great. That makes one of you. Okay, we have a lot to do and not much time to do it. Bernadette, you\u2019re on corn, gravy and yam detail. Amy, you\u2019re on rolls, cranberries and making sure Bernadette stays away from the marshmallows. That\u2019s right, I see you. Okay, if you have any questions, I\u2019ll be over here basting my ass off. Focus is key.\nAmy: Did you guys know Penny married Zack three years ago?\nTogether: What?\nScene: The living room.\nHoward: You ever play football?\nMike: A little in college. You?\nHoward: No. But I did get tackled in the hallway once. The whole school cheered.\nLeonard: Okay, I found the, uh, court papers that you and Zack need to fill out. I\u2019ll print them when we get home.\nPenny: Fine.\nLeonard: And we can just put this whole thing behind us.\nPenny: Are you done?\nLeonard: What?\nPenny: Look, I get it, I screwed up. Is this all we\u2019re gonna talk about the rest of the day?\nLeonard: Why are you mad at me? You\u2019re the one that did the stupid thing. I\u2019m just trying to fix it.\nPenny: Ugh, I need some air.\nLeonard: Wuh, Penny.\nSheldon: I don\u2019t know the first thing about women, but I would not follow her.\nMike: Listen to Stretch.\nLeonard: How am I the bad guy? She\u2019s the one who married someone else. I\u2019m the victim.\nHoward: Sounds like Zack\u2019s the victim. You\u2019re sleeping with his wife.\nMike: I\u2019ve kept my marriage together for 35 years. Can I weigh in here?\nLeonard: Sure.\nMike: I\u2019m trying to watch the game. Shut up. Oh, how do you not make a first down there?\nSheldon: They passed against a nickel defence. They should have run it off-tackle.\nMike: How the hell do you know that?\nSheldon: My father loved football. He always made me watch it before I was allowed to do my homework.\nPenny: Well, you\u2019ll be happy to know I just spoke to Zack and he\u2019s willing to sign the court papers. He\u2019s on his way here now.\nLeonard: Wait, you invited him here?\nPenny: Yeah. \nMike: I\u2019m getting ready to weigh in again.\nLeonard: Come on.\nMike: What do you think they ought to do now?\nSheldon: I would throw a quick slant to a wideout, given that the defence is showing blitz.\nHoward: Oh, I love a good blitz, especially with sour cream. Get it? \u2018Cause it sounds like blintz.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Did someone say blintz?\nScene: The dining room.\nLeonard: I just don\u2019t understand why you invited him here today.\nPenny: Because you wouldn\u2019t shut up about it. When I called him, he had nothing to do, so I just thought it would\u2026\nRaj: Hey, guys, I\u2019m trying to cook in here.\nPenny: Oh, sorry. We\u2019ll keep it down.\nRaj: No, no, speak up. I\u2019m about to use the blender, and I don\u2019t want to miss anything.\nLeonard: Well, you might have to cook for one more because she invited Zack.\nBernadette: What?\nAmy: Ooh!\nRaj: My, my. The plot, like my gravy, thickens.\nScene: The living room.\nSheldon: I don\u2019t care for your mother\u2019s bathroom. There\u2019s not an angle to do one\u2019s business without a clown figurine staring at you.\nHoward: That\u2019s why I sit.\nMike: Yeah, that\u2019s why. You remember the Thanksgiving game when it snowed in Dallas?\nSheldon: 1993. Leon Lett blew the game in the final seconds and the Dolphins emerged victorious. Then I finally got to do my calculus.\nMike: I was so pissed, I wanted to shoot my TV.\nSheldon: So was my dad. And then he did.\nHoward: Anyone need a beer?\nMike: Yeah.\nHoward: Thank God.\nMike: So, does your dad still live in Texas?\nSheldon: No. He died when I was 14.\nMike: I\u2019m sorry to hear that.\nSheldon: So was the man who owned the local liquor store. He cried and cried.\nHoward: Here you go.\nMike: Oh, thanks. So, if your dad died when you were 14, you were never old enough to have a beer with the man.\nSheldon: No, sir. He did try to give me one for my high school graduation, but I was 11 and my mom said no.\nMike: Well, you\u2019re having one with me.\nSheldon: All right.\nMike: To your dad.\nHoward: I never had a beer with my dad, either.\nSheldon: Do you mind? We\u2019re having a moment here.\nScene: The kitchen.\nAmy: I can\u2019t believe Penny\u2019s married to Zack.\nRaj: Wonder what she saw in that guy.\nBernadette: I don\u2019t know. He\u2019s sweet, he\u2019s tall, handsome. \nAmy: Broad shoulders, good hair.\nRaj: Hmm. Wonder what she sees in Leonard.\nBernadette: How\u2019s it going out there?\nHoward: Sheldon and your dad are bonding and completely ignoring me.\nAmy: I know how you feel. Sheldon ignored me for a week when he got that Roomba vacuum. I kick it when he\u2019s not looking.\nBernadette: What are they doing?\nHoward: They\u2019re drinking beer and watching football. \nBernadette: So why don\u2019t you do that with them?\nHoward: They don\u2019t want me.\nBernadette: What do you mean?\nHoward: Well, Sheldon started talking about how his dad isn\u2019t alive any more, and they were toasting, and I tried to tell them about how sad I was when my dad abandoned\u2026\nAmy: Zack\u2019s here!\nRaj: Stir the gravy. \nBernadette: Sorry. I really want to hear how sad you are. I\u2019ll be back in like five, ten minutes.\nScene: The dining room.\nLeonard: Sorry she made you come over here on a holiday.\nZack: It\u2019s all right. I didn\u2019t have anything going on. Plus, Penny told me we\u2019re married, and Thanksgiving\u2019s a time to be with family.\nPenny: Yeah, okay, great. Can we just get this over with?\nLeonard: Yeah, uh, you guys have to sign here and here. On Monday, we\u2019ll file for the annulment, and this marriage will be over.\nPenny: Okay.\nZack: I don\u2019t know if I want to sign it.\nRaj, Bernadette and Amy: Ooh.\nLeonard: Why won\u2019t you sign it?\nZack: I just think splitting up can be rough on kids.\nPenny: We don\u2019t have any kids.\nZack: Are you sure? \u2018Cause you didn\u2019t know we were married until this morning.\nPenny: Okay, look, Zack, come on. You know neither of us thought this was real. I mean, we were married by an Elvis impersonator.\nZack: Of course it was an impersonator. We could never afford a real Elvis.\nLeonard: You married him instead of me? Good call. Sign the papers.\nPenny: Hang on. You know what? You have been a jerk about this all day. You always do this, whenever I mess up, you\u2019re right there to make me feel even worse about it.\nLeonard: That is not true.\nPenny: Yeah, we could\u2019ve waited till Monday, signed the papers, this all would have been over.\nLeonard: You\u2019re the one who invited him here.\nPenny: Oh, there you go again, just another mistake you\u2019re throwing in my face.\nZack: Not cool, bro. I\u2019m starting to think you\u2019re not the kind of guy I want dating my wife.\nLeonard: Yeah, well, she\u2019s not gonna be your wife for long.\nZack: Oh, no. Are you dying?\nPenny: I\u2019m about to. Sign the paper.\nZack: Know what they say, happy wife, happy life. Let\u2019s eat.\nScene: The living room.\nSheldon (burping): Two, three, eight, four, six. (Normal) That\u2019s all I can do without throwing up.\nMike: That is not what I expected when you said you were gonna burp pie.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Did somebody say pie?\nMike: I don\u2019t know what\u2019s scarier, the bathroom clowns or the woman that put them there.\nSheldon: All I know is you can only fit one of her in a car. And there\u2019s the clown that came out of her. I really didn\u2019t want to come here, but this is shaping up to be one of the best Thanksgivings I\u2019ve had in a long time.\nMike: Me, too.\nBernadette: Hey. Howie says you\u2019ve been making fun of him all day. Now, both of you apologize right now.\nSheldon: She\u2019s so tiny. It\u2019s funny when she\u2019s mad.\nAmy: All right, mister, I think you owe Howard and Bernadette an apology.\nSheldon: Perhaps you\u2019re right. I\u2019m sorry for my behaviour. I\u2019ve had alcohol, and it\u2019s caused me to be inappropriate.\nBernadette: It\u2019s okay.\nHoward: Don\u2019t worry about it.\nAmy: Thank you.\nSheldon: Ain\u2019t she great? \nMike: Mmm.\nAmy: Sheldon.\nSheldon: Now, how\u2019s about you get us a couple of beers?\nScene: The dining room.\nBernadette: Thanks again for cooking.\nAmy: Yeah, everything was delicious.\nRaj: Well, I couldn\u2019t have done it without my two favourite girls. Martha Stewart and Rachael Ray.\nMike: Hey, Sheldon, what do you say we go outside and throw around the old pigskin?\nSheldon: This is a Jewish house. I don\u2019t think they have pigskin.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Did someone say pigskin?\nPenny: Hey, I\u2019m sorry about today. And I promise, next time I get married, it won\u2019t be a joke. It\u2019ll be for love. Or money.\nLeonard: I\u2019m sorry, too.\nZack: Don\u2019t be. It\u2019s my fault. I was a terrible husband. I was never around.\nMike: I know I\u2019m hard on you, but you\u2019re not the worst son-in-law in the world.\nHoward: Mike, that\u2019s the nicest thing you\u2019ve ever said to me.\nMike: Well, I\u2019m drunk.\nSheldon: I just vomited on a lot of clowns.\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "4_5": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: All I\u2019m saying is, if they took all the money they spent trying to make a decent Hulk movie, they could probably just make an actual Hulk.\nSheldon: That is apt and amusing. I think I shall share that with Amy Farrah Fowler. She\u2019ll appreciate the witticism.\nLeonard: Thank you.\nSheldon: It\u2019ll also help improve her initial impression of you.\nLeonard: So what\u2019s going on with you two?\nSheldon: Well, the status is as it always was. She\u2019s a girl. She\u2019s a friend. She is not my, please forgive me for doing this, girlfriend.\nLeonard: Right, right. So you\u2019re still just texting and emailing? You don\u2019t feel any need to hang out with her, you know, be in the same room?\nSheldon: Leonard, you are my best friend. I\u2019ve known you for seven years, and I can barely tolerate sitting on the couch with you. Imagine my attitude regarding prolonged physical proximity to Amy Farrah Fowler.\nLeonard: Got it.\nSheldon: I sense judgment on your part.\nLeonard: No, no. Maybe a little.\nSheldon: May I suggest that your criticism is based on jealousy.\nLeonard: Jealousy? What do I have to be jealous of?\nSheldon: I have a functioning and satisfying relationship with a female. You have none.\nLeonard: Oh, right. That.\nSheldon: Jealousy is an ugly green-eyed monster, not unlike the Hulk, who, by the way, also has a girlfriend. In this iteration, Jennifer Connelly, whom you may recall as the girlfriend of Russell Crowe in A Beautiful Mind, a feel-good romp if there ever was one.\nLeonard: I\u2019m not jealous.\nSheldon: Hu-u-urgh! Leonard not jealous.\nCredits sequence. \n \nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: You know, it just occurred to me, if there are an infinite number of parallel universes, in one of them, there\u2019s probably a Sheldon who doesn\u2019t believe parallel universes exist.\nLeonard: Probably. What\u2019s your point?\nSheldon: No point. It\u2019s just one of the things that makes one of the mes chuckle. What makes you chuckle, Leonard?\nLeonard: Hmm, recently? Not much.\nSheldon: Is it because of the conflict that arises from your desperate need to pair-bond with a woman, and the apparent collective decision of all womankind to deny you that opportunity?\nLeonard: Um, shut up.\nSheldon: You know, when my grandfather died, and Meemaw was alone, my mom arranged for her to visit a centre three times a week where she could socialize with other lonely people. It\u2019s very nice. They discuss current events, play bridge, get a hot meal.\nLeonard: That sounds lovely.\nSheldon: It is if you like bridge. Do you like bridge, Leonard?\nLeonard: Sheldon, I\u2019m just not dating someone right now. I don\u2019t need to go to a senior centre.\nSheldon: Meemaw resisted at first, but now she loves it.\nLeonard: Fine. If I don\u2019t meet someone soon, you can put me in a home.\nSheldon: It\u2019s not a home. It\u2019s a senior centre.\u00a0 We\u2019d never put Meemaw in a home!\nScene: The comic book store.\nLeonard: Hey, guys.\nHoward: Hey.\nRaj: Hey.\nSheldon: All right, I\u2019ll bow to social pressure. Hey!\nHoward (phone rings): Excuse me. That\u2019s my girlfriend, Bernadette. I assigned her her own ringtone, Bernadette by The Four Tops. Hello, Bernadette.\nRaj: When I call him, his phone plays Brown Eyed Girl. Which, now that I think about it, is not so good.\nLeonard: You realize he\u2019s just rubbing our noses in the fact that he has a girlfriend, and we don\u2019t.\nRai: You mean, you don\u2019t.\nLeonard: You have a girlfriend? How could you have a girlfriend? You can\u2019t even speak to women.\nRaj: Two words, deaf chick. It doesn\u2019t matter if I can\u2019t talk, because she can\u2019t hear me.\nLeonard: What?\nRaj: That\u2019s what she said.\nLeonard: Great. You have a girlfriend, Howard\u2019s got a girlfriend, Sheldon\u2019s got a girl\u2026\nSheldon: No, no, no, no!\nLeonard: \u2026who\u2019s a friend.\nSheldon: Thank you.\nLeonard: What about you, Stuart? You have a girlfriend yet?\nStuart: Oh, yeah. Yeah. I met her at Comic-Con, the one place in the world where saying I own a comic bookstore is an actual pickup line.\nLeonard: Oh. Well, good for you.\nStuart: Not really. She\u2019s horrible. When she wants to have sex, she puts on her plus-size Wonder Woman costume and shouts who wants to take a ride in my invisible plane?\nLeonard: Why don\u2019t you just break up with her?\nStuart: No, no, I can\u2019t.\nLeonard: Why not?\nStuart: \u2018Cause then I\u2019d be alone, like you.\nRaj: Dude, why don\u2019t you just invoke your girlfriend pact with Wolowitz?\nLeonard: Because I don\u2019t need his girlfriend to set me up with one of her girlfriends. I\u2019m perfectly capable of finding a girl on my own.\nRaj: Oh, Leonard, you remind me of the funny old story about a man who walks into a women\u2019s correctional institution with a stack of paperwork that will allow the female convicts to go free.\nLeonard: You\u2019re saying I couldn\u2019t get laid in a women\u2019s prison with a handful of pardons.\nRaj: Are you going to let me tell the story or not?\nScene: The apartment. Leonard is stretched face down on the sofa.\nSheldon: Leonard? Are you sleeping?\nLeonard: No.\nSheldon: Are you ill?\nLeonard: No.\nSheldon: Are you still depressed because you\u2019re alone, and no one loves you?\nLeonard: I don\u2019t know. Maybe.\nSheldon: I want you to know that I\u2019m genuinely concerned about your well-being.\nLeonard: Thank you.\nSheldon: You\u2019re welcome. But it\u2019s still no reason to have your feet in my spot.\nAmy (on webcam): May I offer an observation?\nLeonard: What the hell? How long has she been here?\nSheldon: Since we got home from the comic bookstore.\nLeonard: That was two hours ago.\nSheldon: As per your suggestion, we\u2019re hanging out. Quite frankly, I don\u2019t see what all the hoopla\u2019s about. Go on, Amy.\nAmy: From a neurobiological standpoint, Leonard, you may be alone because your psychological state is causing an actual pheromone-based stink of desperation.\nSheldon: Did you know that, Leonard?\nLeonard: No.\nSheldon: I did.\nAmy: I understand that some people find mates in social gathering places such as bars or taverns. Have you tried a bar or tavern?\nLeonard: No, I\u2019m not gonna try to pick up a woman in a bar.\nSheldon: Wise decision. You see, Amy, success at a bar is based on classic male attributes such as height, strength, attractiveness, the ability to hold one\u2019s liquor and throw darts, separately or together. Leonard has none of these attributes, right, Leonard?\nLeonard: Right.\nAmy: That\u2019s not true of all bars. Juice bars, for example.\nSheldon: Oh! Good point, Amy. Yeah, building on your premise, Leonard could frequent sushi bars, salad bars, oyster bars, the Apple Genius Bar, what are you doing?\nLeonard (exiting the apartment): Keep going. I\u2019m listening.\nAmy: That was rude.\nSheldon: He does it all the time. He\u2019s a cornucopia of social awkwardness.\nAmy: Cornucopia. What a mellifluous word.\nSheldon: Let\u2019s make that our word of the day.\nAmy: Agreed. And we\u2019ll use mellifluous tomorrow.\nSheldon: Well, I have to void my bladder. It was nice spending this time with you.\nAmy: Wait. I have a request.\nSheldon: Yes?\nAmy: I\u2019d like you to meet my mother.\nSheldon: I see. Can I get back to you on that?\nAmy: Certainly. Good night.\nSheldon: Good night. (Closing laptop, and running down stairs in panic) Leonard, Leonard, Leonard,\nLeonard, Leonard, Leonard, Leonard, Leonard, Leonard, Leonard, Leonard, Leonard, Leonard, Leonard, Leonard, Leonard, Leonard, Leonard, Leonard.\nLeonard: Yeah, what?\nSheldon: Amy Farrah Fowler has asked me to meet her mother.\nLeonard: Yeah. So?\nSheldon: What does that mean?\nLeonard: Well, you know how you\u2019re always saying that Amy is a girl who\u2019s your friend, and not your girlfriend?\nSheldon: Uh-huh.\nLeonard: You can\u2019t say that anymore.\nSheldon: Wait. What?\nLeonard: Look, she obviously wants to take your relationship to the next level.\nSheldon: I don\u2019t want the next level. I like this level. Fix it for me!\nLeonard: Me? Well, how am I supposed to fix it?\nSheldon: Simple! You want a girlfriend, Amy wants to be someone\u2019s girlfriend. Take her off my hands. I give you my blessing.\nLeonard: That is insane.\nSheldon: You\u2019re right. It would never work. Amy finds you tedious.\nLeonard: Okay, good luck.\nSheldon: Wait! What am I supposed to do?\nLeonard: Well, have you considered telling her how you feel?\nSheldon: Leonard, I\u2019m a physicist, not a hippie.\nLeonard: All right, well, let me see if I can explain your situation using physics. What would you be if you were attached to another object by an inclined plane wrapped helically around an axis?\nSheldon: Screwed.\nLeonard: There you go.\nSheldon: Amy\u2019s right. He is tedious.\nScene: Outside Howard\u2019s house. Leonard rings bell.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Howard, get the door!\nHoward (off): Why can\u2019t you get it?\nMrs Wolowitz (off): You know I\u2019m doing a bowel cleanse for my colonoscopy! I\u2019m like an upside-down volcano here.\nHoward: Oh, hey. I hope you didn\u2019t hear that.\nLeonard: The volcano thing? No.\nHoward: What\u2019s with the T-shirt? You working at the Apple store now?\nLeonard: No, it\u2019s just something I threw on.\nHoward: I know all your shirts. That\u2019s not one of them. You were pretending to work at the Genius Bar to pick up women, weren\u2019t you?\nLeonard: Yeah. Turns out, they guard the iPods, but they don\u2019t guard the shirts.\nHoward: So, how\u2019d it go?\nLeonard: It was going well. I was showing this super hot girl how to boot up in Safe Mode. The manager got suspicious, and, well, long story short, they really do have a little jail in the mall.\nHoward: Just FYI, don\u2019t try to go back with a fake moustache. I mean, they may not really be geniuses, but they see right through that.\nLeonard: I want to invoke the girlfriend pact, Howard.\nHoward: You that desperate?\nLeonard: No, I just, I want what you have. You know, I want a woman in my life.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Holy Moses, how much liquid can be in one tukus?\nLeonard: To be clear, I meant like Bernadette, not your mother.\nHoward: Yeah, I know what you mean.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: Well, I\u2019m off to meet Bernadette\u2019s friend. How do I look?\nSheldon: As if one of the plants from Invasion of the Body Snatchers duplicated you in every way, only with an absurd amount of hair gel.\nLeonard: What are you working on?\nSheldon: I\u2019m removing my digital footprint from the Internet so Amy Farrah Fowler can\u2019t find me and compel me to meet her mother.\nLeonard: Ah, you\u2019re going off the grid.\nSheldon: Exactly.\nLeonard: The old Unabomber approach. Kudos.\nSheldon: Thank you. I\u2019ve also sent Amy a relationship termination notice and changed my cell phone number and e-mail address.\nLeonard: What if she just comes over?\nSheldon: She\u2019ll get lost. We no longer live at 2311 Los Robles. We now live at 311 Los Robles.\nLeonard: You changed the address on the building? What about mail?\nSheldon: Oh, no worries, I explained my predicament to our letter carrier. He was sympathetic. His exact words were, Got your back, Jack. Bitches be crazy.\nLeonard (there is a knock on the door): Who is it?\nAmy (off): Amy Farrah Fowler.\nSheldon: Darn! She found me!\nLeonard: She\u2019s been here before.\nSheldon: The only flaw in an otherwise perfect plan. Now, get my back, Jack.\nLeonard: What do you want to do?\nSheldon: Tell her I\u2019m not here.\nLeonard: Okay, where are you?\nSheldon: I don\u2019t know. You\u2019ll have to devise a scenario that plausibly explains my absence, keeping in mind that the key to a good lie lies in the details.\nLeonard: Hi, Amy. Sheldon\u2019s not here.\nAmy: All right. (Leaves)\nSheldon: Way to go on the details.\nScene: A restaurant.\nLeonard: Thanks again for doing this, Bernadette.\nBernadette: Oh, I take pacts very seriously. One time at my lab, a petri dish of genetically modified super-virus went missing. That day we made a pinky swear never to admit we crossed Ebola with the common cold.\nHoward: Why the hell would you cross Ebola with the common cold?\nBernadette: We never did. That would be a terrible, terrible thing.\nGirl (arriving): Hi. Sorry I\u2019m late, I was at the gym. Spin class. Worked up quite a sweat.\nBernadette: Joy, this is Leonard. Leonard, this is Joy.\nLeonard: Hi.\nJoy: Hi. You don\u2019t look like a genius. Go ahead, say something smart.\nLeonard: Uh\u2026\nJoy: Aah! Time\u2019s up. Just kidding. First thing you need to know about me, I\u2019m hilarious.\nLeonard: Yeah. So, Bernadette tells me she knows you from self-defence classes?\nJoy: Yeah. Israeli Krav Maga. Lots of fun. Basically, a hundred different ways to rip a guy\u2019s nuts off.\nLeonard: Wow. Wouldn\u2019t think there\u2019d be that many.\nJoy: Number 42!\nLeonard: Whoa!\nBernadette: Isn\u2019t she a pip?\nScene: The stairwell.\nSheldon (rhythmically, while walking down the stairs): Proxima Centauri\u2019s the nearest star. The celestial bodies that follow are Alpha Centauri A, Toli, Barnard\u2019s Star, Wolf 359, Lalande 21185, Sirius A, Sirius B, BL-Ceti, UV-Ceti, Ross 154, Ross 248, Epsilon Eridani, Lac-9352, Ross 128, Procyon A, oh, darn, that\u2019s wrong! (Heads back up stairs) EZ Aquarii A, EZ Aquarii B, EZ Aquarii C, Procyon A. Those are the stars that are nearest to me. Tra-la-la and fiddle-dee-dee. (Sees Amy standing in lobby) Oh, dear. They really do be crazy.\nScene: The restaurant. \nJoy (burping): This lobster\u2019s good on the way down and the way up.\nLeonard: Should be, it\u2019s thirty dollars a pound.\nJoy: Hey, this is a date, right?\nLeonard: Yep, it is.\nJoy: 73!\nLeonard: Whoa!\nJoy: Excuse me, I have to go to the little girls\u2019 room and take a wicked whiz.\nBernadette: I\u2019ll go with you.\nJoy: Fair warning, I had the asparagus. My pee is gonna stink up the place.\nHoward: I think she likes you.\nScene: The stairwell. Amy is sitting on the bottom step.\nSheldon (wearing a heavy coat and false nose and glasses): EZ Aquarii B, EZ Aquarii C, excuse me, madam.\nAmy: Sheldon?\nSheldon: Rats!\nAmy: I believe a misunderstanding may have occurred when I asked you to meet my mother.\nSheldon: No misunderstanding. I\u2019ve learned what that request actually means, and I don\u2019t want to be joined to another object by an inclined plane wrapped helically around an axis.\nAmy: In what way are you screwed? All I want to do is present you as my boyfriend to my mother so she\u2019ll be satisfied that I\u2019m in a relationship.\nSheldon: So we\u2019d be perpetrating a ruse?\nAmy: Precisely.\nSheldon: And you haven\u2019t fallen hopelessly in love with me?\nAmy: Don\u2019t be absurd. I find the notion of romantic love to be an unnecessary cultural construct that adds no value to human relationships.\nSheldon: Amy Farrah Fowler, that\u2019s the most pragmatic thing anyone has ever said to me.\nAmy: I trust this clarification allows us to return to boy-slash-friend-slash-girl-slash-friend status.\nSheldon: Of course. Would you like to join me for Chinese food?\nAmy: Sheldon, please, you\u2019re suffocating me.\nSheldon: My apologies. Good night, Amy.\nAmy: Good night, Sheldon.\nScene: The restaurant. \nHoward: Come on, just give her a chance. Maybe she\u2019ll grow on you.\nLeonard: Or maybe she\u2019ll finally succeed in ripping my nuts off. There are still 93 ways she hasn\u2019t tried yet. Look, Howard, I appreciate the effort, but this is, like, the worst date of my life.\nHoward: Seriously? I was once robbed by a pre-op transsexual I met on J-Date, and that didn\u2019t even crack my top ten.\nLeonard: I guess the difference is, I have some self-respect.\nHoward: Not that I\u2019ve ever seen.\nLeonard: It\u2019s relatively new. I just know that I\u2019m not gonna spend time with someone I don\u2019t like simply to have a girlfriend. I\u2019m okay on my own.\nJoy: Good news, I made lots of room for dessert.\nLeonard: Look, uh, Joy, it was nice to meet you, but\u2026\nJoy: Yeah, you, too. Hey, you got anything for next weekend? I need a date for my cousin\u2019s wedding.\nLeonard: You\u2019re asking me out?\nJoy: Yeah. And it\u2019s an open bar, so I\u2019ll probably be giving it away.\nLeonard: I look forward to it.\nScene: The apartment. \nMrs Fowler (on webcam): It\u2019s nice to meet you, too, Sheldon. I honestly didn\u2019t believe Amy when she told me she had a boyfriend.\nSheldon: I assure you I am quite real and I\u2019m having regular intercourse with your daughter.\nMrs Fowler: What?\nSheldon: Oh, yes. We\u2019re like wild animals in heat. It\u2019s a wonder neither of us has been hurt.\nMrs Fowler: Amy, what is he saying?\nAmy: You wanted me to have a boyfriend, Mother. Well, here he is. Have to sign off now. My hunger for Sheldon is stirring in my loins.\nSheldon: Oh, yes, it\u2019s time for me to make love to your daughter\u2019s vagina.\nMrs Fowler: Oh!\nAmy: Thank you, Sheldon, that went very well.\nSheldon: Agreed. Amy, I find myself wondering if we should actually engage in coitus at least one time in our relationship. Bazinga. Bedtime. Please show yourself out.\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "3_8": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: A camp site.\nHoward: How much time do we have?\nLeonard: Uh, t-minus five hours, 37 minutes to onset of meteor shower.\nRaj: Okay, our position is 34.48 degrees north, 118.31 west. That means the azimuth should be 168.22 degrees relative to magnetic north with an elevation of 49.93.\nHoward: Anything yet?\nLeonard: Uh, we have a signal, but there\u2019s no frame lock.\nHoward: Hang on, how about now?\nRaj: We did it. We have the west coast feed of HBO.\nHoward: Ooh, Real Sex.\nRaj: Big deal.

While my colleagues are off observing the Leonid meteor shower, I have remained behind to complete my paper on the decays of highly excited massive string states. Although my research is going well I do miss the warmth of human companionship. (He laughs)\n \nCredits sequence.\n \nScene: The apartment.\n \nSheldon: And good evening to you, Siam Palace. This is Sheldon Cooper. Yeah, I\u2019m going to be dining alone this evening, so I\u2019ll be reducing my usual order. I\u2019d like to start with one quarter of the assorted appetizers plate and, uh, one half of the golden treasure for two. Oh, for heaven\u2019s sake, in the mid-18th century, King Rama IV of Siam divided a huge empire amongst the colonial powers of Europe in order to preserve his throne. Surely, you, his cultural descendant, can handle pad thai and dumplings.\nPenny (voice off): Sheldon help!\nSheldon: I need to go, but you keep in mind that my sharply worded comments on yelp.com recently took down a local muffin store.

Don\u2019t you dare knock.\nSheldon: Hello.\nPenny: I slipped in the shower, and I think I dislocated my shoulder.\nSheldon: Not surprising. You have no safety mat or adhesive stickers to allow for purchase on a surface with a low coefficient of static friction.\nPenny: What?\nSheldon: Tubs are slippery.\nPenny: I know. I slipped.\nSheldon: I have a series of whimsical duck stickers on the bottom of my tub.\nPenny: Yeah, okay, whatever. Will you just turn the water off and help me up?\nSheldon: They\u2019re holding umbrellas.\nPenny: What?\nSheldon: The ducks in my tub.\nPenny: Uh-huh.\nSheldon: They\u2019re whimsical because ducks have neither the need for, nor the ability to use umbrellas.\nPenny: Oh, my god. I got to go to the emergency room.\nSheldon: Well, assuming you\u2019re correct that your right humerus is no longer seated in the glenoid socket, I would certainly think so.\nPenny: Okay, can you drive me?\nSheldon: I don\u2019t drive.\nPenny: Well, I can\u2019t drive!\nSheldon: Well, it seems we\u2019ve reached an impasse.\nPenny: Ow.\nSheldon: But I could call you a cab or an ambulance.\nPenny: No, no, no, I can\u2019t wait that long, you got to help me, please.\nSheldon: All right. Let it never be said that Sheldon Lee Cooper ignored the pleas of a damsel in distress.\nPenny: No one\u2019s saying that. Let\u2019s go.\nSheldon: Well, it does seem rather ironic that for want of 99-cent adhesive ducks, we both might die in a fiery car crash.\nScene: The camp site.\n \nLeonard: I wish Penny didn\u2019t have to work, she loves camping.\nRaj: Yeah, that would have been great. You and Penny having sex in the tent while I sit out here and watch Howard hump a cactus.\nHoward: Okay, the best I can tell, there are eight other campsites nearby. Mostly science nerds like us, but just over yon ridge are two not unattractive middle school teachers who reek of desperation.\nRaj: Wow. Wonderful. How old are they?\nHoward: Oh I don\u2019t know, 50, 55.\nRaj: Oh, menopause, nature\u2019s birth control.\nLeonard: Come on, you guys can\u2019t be that hard up.\nHoward: I am.\nRaj: Yeah, me, too.\nHoward: Look, they gave me homemade cookies.\nLeonard: Of course, they did. That\u2019s what grandmothers do.\nRaj: So, what are we waiting for?\nHoward: Relax, I said we\u2019d stop by a little later after they have their nap.\nRaj: Good idea. They\u2019ll be refreshed.\nHoward: Cookie?\nRaj: Yeah, thank you. Mmmm.\nLeonard: Mmmm, not bad.\nRaj: Yeah, very tasty. Well, so tell me more about these teachers.\nHoward: Not much to tell. They had a VW Microbus and were wearing tie-dyed Grateful Dead shirts.\nRaj: Huh. Mmm. Good cookies.\nScene: Penny\u2019s bedroom.\nSheldon: I see no organizational system in here whatsoever. Which panties do you wear on Mondays?\nPenny: I don\u2019t need panties, I just need shorts and a shirt.\nSheldon: My mother always told me one should wear clean underpants in case one is in an accident.\nPenny: One was already in an accident.\nSheldon: That doesn\u2019t mean one won\u2019t be in another, especially if I\u2019m driving.\nPenny: Clothes, Sheldon. I need clothes!\nSheldon: Okay, here.\nPenny: Seriously? Those shorts with that top?\nSheldon: All right.\nPenny: No\u2026 No\u2026 Oh, that\u2019s cute.\nSheldon: We should have you checked for a concussion.\nPenny: Okay, now, you got to help me put these on.\nSheldon: All right.\nPenny: But don\u2019t look.\nSheldon: Don\u2019t look?\nPenny: I don\u2019t want you to see me naked.\nSheldon: Oh. Well, that\u2019s understandable. You may be interested to know that a prohibition against looking is well established in heroic mythology. Uh, Lot and his wife, Perseus and Medusa, Orpheus and Eurydice.\nPenny: Yeah, great.\nSheldon: They always look. It never ends well.\nPenny: Ok, now you gotta help me get my arm into the sleeve.\nSheldon: Ok.\nPenny: Is that my arm?\nSheldon: It doesn\u2019t feel like an arm.\nPenny: Then, maybe you should let it go.\nSheldon: All righty.\nScene: The camp site. \nLeonard: Stars are pretty, aren\u2019t they?\nHoward: Up above the world so high, like little diamonds in the sky.\nRaj: That\u2019s beautiful, dude. You should\u2026 You should write that down before someone steals it.\nHoward: So, when do the meteors get here?\nRaj: The meteors don\u2019t get here, the earth is moving into their path.\nLeonard: I can feel it. I can feel the earth moving. It\u2019s moving too fast. Raj, slow it down.\nRaj: Okay, how\u2019s that?\nLeonard: Better. Thanks.\nHoward: Stars are pretty, aren\u2019t they?\nLeonard: What\u2019s so funny?\nRaj: It\u2019s your American accent. Everything you say sounds stupid. (With an American accent) Stars are pretty, aren\u2019t they?\nScene: Penny\u2019s car.\nSheldon: For the record, I should let you know this is my first time driving an actual motor vehicle.\nPenny: You have your learner\u2019s permit, right?\nSheldon: Yes, and I have logged a considerable number of hours on a simulator.\nPenny: Good.\nSheldon: Didn\u2019t work out well.\nPenny: All right, can we please go?\nSheldon: One moment. According to my driver\u2019s ed book, a side mirror is properly adjusted when a portion of the is driver\u2019s door handle is visible in the lower right corner. There\u2019s the handle. Oh, no, too far, bringing it back. Optimized. Now, where is the switch to adjust the passenger side mirror?\nPenny: It\u2019s right there.\nSheldon: Where is the passenger side mirror?\nPenny: In a parking lot in Hollywood. Now, can we please go?\nSheldon: Yes. As soon as I adjust my seat. Whee! Oh, dear. I\u2019m going to have to start again.\nScene: The camp site. \n \nRaj: If I could speak the language of rabbits, they would be amazed, and I would be their king.\nLeonard: I hate my name. It has nerd in it. Len nerd.\nHoward: I lost my virginity to my cousin Jeanie.\nRaj: I would be kind to my rabbit subjects. At first.\nLeonard: You know what\u2019s a cool name? Angelo. That has angel and jell-o in it.\nHoward: It was my Uncle Murray\u2019s funeral. We were all back at my Aunt Barbara\u2019s house. Our eyes locked over the pickled herring. We never meant for it to happen.\nRaj: One day, I hold a great ball for the President of France, but the rabbits, they hate me and don\u2019t come. I am embarrassed, so I eat all the lettuce in the world and make them watch.\nLeonard: People could call me Angie. Yo, Angie, how\u2019s it goin\u2019?\nHoward: To this day, I can\u2019t look at pickled herring without being aroused and ashamed. Oh, cousin Jeanie.\nScene: Penny\u2019s car.\nPenny: Could you please drive a little faster?\nSheldon: Oh, I think we\u2019re going sufficiently fast. What\u2019s that?\nPenny: Nothing. The engine does that sometimes.\nSheldon: That can\u2019t be nothing, the check engine light is on. We need to find a service station.\nPenny: No. The light has been on since I bought the car.\nSheldon: All the more reason to consult with a mechanic before it explodes.\nPenny: It\u2019s not going to explode, just keep driving. Warp speed ahead, Mr. Spock.\nSheldon: Mr. Spock did not pilot the Enterprise. He was the science officer, and I guarantee you that if he ever saw the Enterprise\u2019s check engine light blinking, he would pull the ship over immediately.\nPenny: Oh, god, I\u2019m gonna lose the arm.\nSheldon: Oh, oh, red light, release accelerator and slowly apply the brake. Nailed it. While we have a moment, may I ask you a question?\nPenny: What?\nSheldon: Why do you have the Chinese character for soup tattooed on your right buttock?\nPenny: It\u2019s not soup, it\u2019s courage.\nSheldon: No, it isn\u2019t. But I suppose it does take courage to demonstrate that kind of commitment to soup.\nPenny: How did you see it? You said you wouldn\u2019t look.\nSheldon: Sorry. As I told you, the hero always peeks.\nScene: The camp site. \nHoward: Anything?\nLeonard: No. That was the last pudding cup.\nHoward: No! What about Slim Jims?\nLeonard: That\u2019s what he used to eat his pudding, remember?\nRaj: Right! That was so good! Sweety and meaty at the same time.\nHoward: Wait. Wait, wait. So you\u2019re saying we\u2019re out of food?\nLeonard: The only thing in here are blue ice packs.\nRaj: I know they\u2019re poison, but they look like big, yummy otter pops.\nLeonard: Oh, god, I am so hungry.\nHoward: Me too. Check and see if we have any more pudding.\nLeonard: Okay.\nScene: The hospital waiting room.\nSheldon: All right, there\u2019s no need to bark at me. According to the inexplicably irritable nurse behind the desk, you\u2019ll be seen after the man who claims to be having a heart attack, but appears to be well enough to play Doodle Jump on his iPhone. We have to fill these out. Describe illness or injury.\nPenny: I dislocated my shoulder.\nSheldon: All right. And how did the accident occur?\nPenny: You ready know that.\nSheldon: Cause of accident, lack of adhesive ducks. Okay, medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with diabetes?\nPenny: No.\nSheldon: Kidney disease?\nPenny: No.\nSheldon: Migraines?\nPenny: Getting one.\nSheldon: Are you currently pregnant?\nPenny: No.\nSheldon: Are you sure? You look a bit puffy.\nPenny: Change migraine to yes.\nSheldon: When was your last menstrual period?\nPenny: Oh, next question.\nSheldon: I\u2019ll put, in progress. Okay, moving to psychiatric disorders, list all major behavioural diagnoses, e.g. depression, anxiety, etcetera.\nPenny: Oh, my god, what the hell does this have to do with my stupid shoulder?\nSheldon: Episodes of sub psychotic rage.\nPenny: Ass.\nSheldon: Possible Tourette\u2019s. All right, moles, lesions or other skin conditions. Soup tattoo on right buttock.\nPenny: Hey, Sheldon, Sheldon, look, I am scared and in a lot of pain. Could you please just take a break from being you for just a minute and try being, I don\u2019t know, comforting?\nSheldon: I\u2019m sorry. There, there. Everything\u2019s going to be fine. Sheldon\u2019s here.\nPenny: Thanks. That\u2019s much better.\nScene: The camp site.\nRaj: Oh, I\u2019m so hungry!\nLeonard: Will you shut up? We\u2019re all hungry.\nHoward: Okay, our objective is the boy scout campsite to the east. Easy target. Big doughy scout master, couple of cubs, most webelos.\nLeonard: What kind of score are we looking at?\nHoward: Hot dogs, buns, s\u2019mores, I mean, it\u2019s a freaking 7-11.\nLeonard: All right, everyone grab flashlights.\nHoward: Oh, my god, could it be? Yes! My mother put an I love you brisket in my backpack.\nLeonard: Quick, get forks.\nHoward: You don\u2019t need forks. It\u2019s so tender, it falls apart in your hands.\nRaj: He\u2019s right.\nLeonard: I feel like we\u2019re forgetting something important.\nRaj: Me, too. But what? (Behind them, the meteor shower has begun)\nHoward: Maybe a tupperware bowl of roasted potatoes and carrots?\nLeonard and Raj together: Yes! Yes!\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment.\nSheldon: Now remember, you were given powerful pain medication and a muscle relaxer, so, uh, don\u2019t operate heavy machinery. Try not to choke on your own drool.\nPenny: Wait. You have to help me get into bed. Sheldon has to get me into bed. Bet you never thought I\u2019d say that.\nSheldon: Yes. The charm of your drug addled candour knows no bounds.\nPenny: You know, people think you\u2019re this weird robot man who\u2019s so annoying all the time, and you totally are, but then it\u2019s like that movie Wall-E at the end. You\u2019re so full of love, and you can save a plant and get fat people out of the floaty chairs.\nSheldon: That\u2019s a fairly laboured metaphor, but I appreciate the sentiment behind it.\nPenny: Sing \u201cSoft Kitty\u201d to me.\nSheldon: \u201cSoft Kitty\u201d is for when you\u2019re sick. You\u2019re not sick.\nPenny: Injured and drugged is a kind of sick.\nSheldon (singing): Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur\u2026\nPenny: Wait, wait. Let\u2019s sing it as a round. I\u2019ll start. Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur\u2026 See that\u2019s where you come in. I\u2019ll start over. Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur\u2026 I\u2019ve got all night, Sheldon. Soft kitty, warm kitty\u2026 (Sheldon joins in with the round) little ball of fur, happy kitty, sleepy kitty, purr, purr, purr.\nScene: The camp site. Raj is telling a ghost story with the torch on his face.\nRaj: \u2026And the next morning when he woke up, he rolled over and realized\u2026 duh-duh-duh! \u2026she was his cousin.\nHoward: That\u2019s still not funny.\nRaj (imitating him): That\u2019s still not funny.\nHoward: And she was my second cousin.\nRaj (imitating him): And she was my second cousin.\nHoward: You\u2019re a real douche.\nRaj: Who cares? You slept with your cousin.\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "7_1": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: On the deck of a ship on the North Sea, in the middle of a storm. Leonard is on a sat-phone.\nLeonard: Sheldon, it\u2019s not a great time, what do you want?\nSheldon (in the apartment): Hello to you, too. I\u2019m sorry, but this is important.\nLeonard: What is it?\nSheldon: Back to the Future II was in the Back to the Future III case, and Back to the Future III was, get this, in the Back to the Future II case.\nLeonard: So?\nSheldon: So, did you do that, or am I in the house with an intruder?\nLeonard: Sheldon, I got to go inside. It\u2019s getting rough out here.\nSheldon: You\u2019re dodging the question, I knew it was you. What was that?\nLeonard: What was what?\nSheldon: This isn\u2019t a very good connection, but it sounded like someone just released a kraken.\nLeonard: Okay, I\u2019m hanging up now. You know there\u2019s no such thing as a k\u2026 (Leonard is attacked and dragged into the sea by a huge tentacle. Sheldon wakes up in bed.)\nSheldon: No!\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment door.\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. \nPenny: What\u2019s the matter?\nSheldon: Um, well, I was worried that you might be missing Leonard. And that might be causing you to have bad dreams, like the kind you\u2019d get if you watched Clash of the Titans right before you went to bed.\nPenny: Sweetie, did you have a bad dream?\nSheldon: To be honest, I did.\nPenny: Aw.\nSheldon: Back to the Future II was in the Back to the Future III case. Leonard did it.\nPenny: Good night.\nSheldon: No, wait. Perhaps I should sleep here so you don\u2019t miss Leonard as much, uh, \u2019cause you\u2019re being kind of a baby about it.\nPenny: You know what? That would make me feel better. Thank you.\nSheldon: You\u2019re welcome. Good night.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The cafeteria. \nRaj: I think you\u2019d be pleased to hear that this morning in the parking garage I saw this oil stain on the ground that was shaped just like my ex-girlfriend, Lucy, and I didn\u2019t get upset at all.\nHoward: I\u2019m proud of you.\nRaj: Well, you should be, \u2019cause she was looking good.\nSheldon: Dear Lord, you\u2019re an astronomer. Although you may have earthly woes, get your mind back on the stars. Gee, even the lowly dung beetle chooses to plot its course by using the Milky Way.\nRaj: Is that true?\nSheldon: Everything I say is true. Now, of course, the dung beetle also enjoys eating faeces, living in faeces and making little balls out of faeces, so, you know, pick and choose which aspects of its lifestyle you want to embrace.\nHoward: Come on, you can talk to girls now. It shouldn\u2019t be hard for you to meet someone new.\nRaj: How can I meet someone new when everywhere I look, I see Lucy\u2019s face? Tell me you don\u2019t see her smile in the crust of this chicken pot pie.\nHoward: Oh, will you stop it. Now, listen to me, there\u2019s a welcome party for incoming post-docs tonight. Go to it and meet someone who isn\u2019t made of grease or pie.\nRaj: You think you\u2019re so cool because your wife is a person?\nHoward: Look, Bernie\u2019s at a neuroscience conference with Amy, I\u2019ll go with you.\nRaj: You would do that for me?\nHoward: Of course. You\u2019re my friend. I want you to be happy.\nRaj: Thanks. Oh, Sheldon, since Amy\u2019s out of town, would you like to join us?\nSheldon: I want you to be happy, too, but not enough to do anything about it.\nScene: A hotel room.\nBernadette (on phone): Howie, stop. I can\u2019t talk like that. Amy\u2019s right here.\nAmy (on phone): Sheldon, stop. For the last time, I will not bring home bed bugs. \nBernadette: The hotel\u2019s nice. There\u2019s a pool, a gym, the bar looks like fun. \nAmy: Because I looked in the bed, and there are no bugs.\nBernadette: Aw, I love you, too. If I don\u2019t talk to you before you go to sleep, I\u2019ll meet you in dreamland.\nAmy: Good night. No, I will not consider sleeping in my garment bag.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Penny, did you ever wonder how Starfleet captains\u2026\nPenny: No.\nSheldon: Well, now that I\u2019ve piqued your interest, welcome to the exciting world of 3D chess.\nPenny: Why don\u2019t you just admit you only want to play this game because you always play it with Leonard and you miss him?\nSheldon: You overestimate his significance in my life.\nPenny: Mmm.\nSheldon: Do I miss how he makes a face on my toaster waffle with syrup? No. Do I miss the way he fixes the zipper on my jacket when it gets stuck? I don\u2019t think so. Do I miss how we say good night to each other through the walls of our bedroom using Morse code? (Taps out No in morse code on the table)\nPenny: Okay, I get it, I get it. You are an emotionless robot.\nSheldon: Well, I try.\nPenny: All right, let\u2019s just get this stupid game over with.\nSheldon: Great. I\u2019ll go first.\nPenny: Okay.\nSheldon: By the way, how are you with zippers?\nPenny: Why?\nSheldon: Well, I really need to go to the bathroom, and this one\u2019s gone all cattywampus.\nScene: The mixer party. \nRaj: Wow, your work on jellyfish neural nets sounds so interesting. \nGirl: It is. You can download my paper off the university server.\nRaj: I will. You can download my paper on the Van Allen Belts from the university server as well.\nGirl: I will.\nRaj: All right.\nHoward: How\u2019d it go?\nRaj: Well, if you like dry, factual statements interspersed with painful moments of silence, it was bananas.\nHoward: Check it out. Mrs. Davis from Human Resources is here. She\u2019s probably on the lookout for sexual harassment.\nRaj: Oh, great. There go my chances of being sexually harassed.\nHoward: I heard her husband left her for a hot, young undergrad.\nRaj: That\u2019s so much better than the old, ugly ones.\nMrs Davis: Mr. Wolowitz, Dr. Koothrappali. \nHoward: Mrs. Davis, nice to see you. \nRaj: You know, I recently read a fascinating article on infidelity among penguins.\nMrs Davis: Okay.\nRaj: So if the fact that your husband left you makes you feel unattractive, just remember, penguins get cheated on, and they\u2019re adorable.\nHoward: It was better when you couldn\u2019t talk to women.\nScene: The hotel bar.\nBernadette: I was thinking of going to the lecture on posterior cingulate cortex lesions in the formation of autobiographical memory.\nAmy: Oh, brain lesions are fascinating. Unless they\u2019re yours, then they\u2019re a drag.\nBernadette: To the advancement of science.\nAmy: And to the sick and dying who make it possible.\nBernadette: This is fun, we never really get to talk shop with Penny around. We usually just end up talking about boys.\nAmy: Which is fine, but it\u2019s nice to mix it up with a little intellectual conversation.\nWaiter: From the two gentlemen at the bar.\nAmy: Oh, my gosh, boys bought us drinks, boys bought us drinks. Thank you, thank you, thank you so much.\nBernadette: Be cool.\nAmy: You be cool. Guys are hitting on us, and not just to get to Penny.\nBernadette: You\u2019re right. Thank you.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Ooh. Bad move.\nPenny: Really? Why?\nSheldon: My queen can now take your rook from below.\nPenny: So that means I lose, right? It\u2019s over?\nSheldon: If I make this move, but I won\u2019t because we\u2019re having too much fun.\nPenny: Okay, let\u2019s take a break. \nSheldon: We\u2019re all out of alcohol.\nPenny: I wasn\u2019t going to get alcohol. Gosh, I wonder what Leonard\u2019s doing right now. I miss him so much.\nSheldon: Well, if you\u2019d like, we could call him. I mean that you could call him. As I\u2019ve explained, the absence of my friends does not cause me pain. As rock and roll bad boy Paul Simon once said, I am a rock, I am an i-i-i-island.\nPenny: I\u2019m calling him.\nSheldon: Oh, goodie, put him on speaker phone.\nLeonard (on board boat, at a party, dancing): Excuse me, ladies, my pants are buzzing. North Sea, how can I kelp you?\nPenny: Leonard?\nLeonard: Penny? Hey, it\u2019s Penny. Everybody say hi to Penny.\nEverybody: Hi, Penny!\nPenny: Wow, it sounds like you\u2019re having a good time.\nLeonard: Best time of my life. \nSheldon: Isn\u2019t it five thirty in the morning there?\nLeonard: Is it? Hey, everybody, it\u2019s five thirty in the morning!\nPenny: Uh, okay, well, we were just calling you because we were missing you.\nRandom voice: Iceberg!\nLeonard: Uh-oh, hang on.\nSheldon: Are you in danger?\nLeonard: No, it\u2019s a drinking game. Whenever we see an iceberg, we take a shot!\nEverybody: Berg! Berg! Berg! Berg! Berg! Berg!\nPenny: Leonard, Leonard? I cannot believe we were missing that jerk.\nSheldon: You were.\nScene: The hotel bar.\nAmy: So what happened? How\u2019d it go?\nBernadette: It\u2019s fine. I thanked them again and let them know we\u2019re not available.\nAmy: So I can drink this without having to give up the goodies?\nBernadette: Yes, it\u2019s all cool. Although, if you wanted to talk to one of them, no one would blame you.\nAmy: And why would no one blame me?\nBernadette: I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m saying.\nAmy: Well, it sounds like you\u2019re saying that I could do better than Sheldon.\nBernadette: Boy, these drinks are strong. Hoo, mama, I\u2019m gonna be huggin\u2019 the toilet tonight.\nAmy: No, tell me, I want to know what you meant by that.\nBernadette: I just meant that you\u2019re not married and your boyfriend\u2019s kind of, Sheldon.\nAmy: And your husband is extremely Howard. What\u2019s your point?\nBernadette: Sorry. I have no point. That was a stupid thing to say. Can we please just go back to having a nice time?\nAmy: We could, but unfortunately my brain is lesion-free and I remember that rotten thing you just said about my sweet baboo.\nBernadette: Come on. I apologize. Can we please just let it go?\nAmy: Sure.\nBernadette: Thanks.\nAmy: Your husband\u2019s weird and his clothes are ridiculous.\nScene: The apartment.\nPenny: I can\u2019t believe it. All this time I\u2019ve been doing nothing but sit around and miss that guy. And you know what the worst part is?\nSheldon: That you\u2019re having to process your emotional pain without vodka?\nPenny: No. Yeah. But you know what the second-worst part is? He does not miss me at all.\nSheldon: Allow me to comfort you. At least you\u2019ve got your health.\nPenny: Really? That, that\u2019s it? That\u2019s comforting?\nSheldon: Um, uh, in a hundred years, you\u2019ll both be dead and it won\u2019t matter?\nPenny: No. Come on, you\u2019re supposed to say, of course he misses you, the only reason he\u2019s partying is to cover up his pain.\nSheldon: Oh, no, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s true at all.\nPenny: This is ridiculous. Why am I upset just because he\u2019s off having a good time?\nSheldon: Well, perhaps you\u2019re obsessively picturing him engaged in drunken coitus with another woman. Is that it? Did I get it right?\nPenny: Okay, that, that\u2019s great. You can stop trying to make me feel better now.\nSheldon: Actually, I can\u2019t. Before Leonard left, he made me promise that I\u2019d take care of you.\nPenny: He did?\nSheldon: Yes.\nPenny: Oh, that\u2019s really sweet.\nSheldon: Plus, if I do a good job, he said he\u2019d bring me back a sailor\u2019s cap.\nPenny: Well, now I miss him even more.\nSheldon: Well, if it\u2019s any consolation, I\u2019m sure Leonard\u2019s tormented every moment he\u2019s away from your warm embrace and cherry lips.\nPenny: Thanks.\nSheldon: Oh, seriously?\nScene: The mixer.\nRaj: Uh, excuse me, Mrs. Davis?\nMrs Davis: What?\nRaj: I\u2019d like to apologize for being insensitive. And for possibly making penguins seem like jerks, because 99% of them are stand-up guys.\nMrs Davis: Forget about it.\nRaj: You know, you, you and I, you and I have a lot in common.\nMrs Davis: Is that right?\nRaj: Oh, yes, I, I too am in the throes of heartbreak. Okay, fine, I\u2019ll tell you about it.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Here is a hot beverage to comfort you. It\u2019s in a to-go cup. Make of that what you will.\nPenny: Come on. It\u2019s still early. Let\u2019s do something.\nSheldon: Well, I have been toying around with an idea for 4D chess.\nPenny: How about we just talk?\nSheldon: All right. In 4D chess\u2026\nPenny: No. Come on, let\u2019s talk about our lives. Tell me something about you I don\u2019t know.\nSheldon: I own nine pairs of pants.\nPenny: Okay, that, that\u2019s a good start, but I was thinking maybe something a little more personal.\nSheldon: I see. I own nine pairs of underpants.\nPenny: How about I go first?\nSheldon: But I don\u2019t want to know how many underpants you own. Although, based on the floor of your bedroom, I\u2019d say it\u2019s a thousand.\nPenny: Okay, look, here\u2019s something people do not know about me. When I first moved out to L.A., I did a topless scene in a low-budget horror movie about a killer gorilla. Ugh! After I did it, I felt so ashamed. Thankfully, that thing never came out.\nSheldon: I\u2019ve seen that. Yeah. Serial Apeist. Howard found it online the day we met you.\nPenny: Oh, God.\nSheldon: And it was literally the moment you walked out the door. But I see the type of personal revelations you\u2019re going for. Okay, here\u2019s one I thought I\u2019d take to the grave.\nPenny: Okay.\nSheldon: Hmm. A while back, YouTube changed its user interface from a star-based rating system to a thumbs-up rating system. I tell people I\u2019m okay with it, but I\u2019m really not.\nPenny: That\u2019s your big revelation?\nSheldon: Yes. Whew, I feel ten pounds lighter.\nPenny: Okay, you know what? I give up. I\u2019m going to bed.\nSheldon: Here\u2019s something else you don\u2019t know about me. You just hurt my feelings.\nPenny: What did I do?\nSheldon: I opened up and shared something deeply upsetting to me, and you treated it as if it were nothing.\nPenny: I, I didn\u2019t think it was a big deal.\nSheldon: It is to me; that\u2019s the point.\nPenny: Sheldon, you are right. I\u2019m really sorry. I should\u2019ve known better.\nSheldon: Your apology is accepted.\nPenny: Thank you. How about a hug?\nSheldon: How about a hearty handshake?\nPenny: Come on.\nSheldon: Now I know how you felt getting mauled by that sex-crazed gorilla.\nScene: The hotel room.\nBernadette: Good night.\nAmy: Mm-hmm. It was rather flattering to have strangers send us drinks.\nBernadette: Yeah, that felt nice.\nAmy: Maybe tomorrow morning we put on some hot pants and see if we can score us some free omelettes.\nBernadette: So, hypothetically, if, if we were to have gone with them, which one would you have picked?\nAmy: I think I would have gone with the short one with the goofy haircut.\nBernadette: Oh, good, \u2019cause I liked the tall thin one. He seemed intelligent, kind of a loner, maybe a little sexually inexperienced, like I\u2019d have to teach him a thing or two.\nAmy: Not my guy. I caught him staring at my rack. It\u2019d be nice to be with a man who wants to know what\u2019s underneath my cardigan. FYI, it\u2019s another cardigan.\nBernadette: Your short sexed-up guy kind of sounds like Howard.\nAmy: Your brainy virgin kind of sounds like Sheldon.\nBoth: Good night.\nScene: The mixer.\nMrs Davis: All right, Dr. Koothrappali, it\u2019s been nice talking to you, but I need to go home and relieve my babysitter.\nRaj: Yeah, I can relate to being a single parent. I have a dog.\nMrs Davis: Yeah, it\u2019s exactly the same thing. Good night.\nRaj: Mrs. Davis, I, uh, I must confess, I came here tonight in a futile attempt to pick up some lonely postdoc, but instead I got to connect with you at a human level. That\u2019s a much better evening. You\u2019re a lovely person.\nMrs Davis: Are you hitting on me?\nRaj: No, no, no, that would be crazy. I mean, if I were hitting on you, you\u2019d know it \u2019cause you\u2019d feel uncomfortable and a little sad for me.\nMrs Davis: You\u2019re sweet. Good night, Dr. Koothrappali.\nRaj: Good night.\nHoward: Looks like she accepted your apology.\nRaj: And then some. I think we had a moment.\nHoward: Oh, please, you did not have a moment.\nRaj: Who died and made you king of moments?\nHoward: Okay, fine. Let\u2019s say there was a moment.\nRaj: There was.\nHoward: There wasn\u2019t. But, but even if there was, what are you gonna do about it?\nRaj: I will slowly seduce her until she falls helpless into my bed, hungry for the pleasure only I can give her.\nHoward: So nothing.\nRaj: No, not a thing.\nScene: A bathroom shower.\nPenny (acting): Ah, I\u2019m so glad the police finally caught that psychotic genetically engineered ape.\nLeonard (on ship): That is my girlfriend.

People order cheesecake, and I bring it to them.\nLeonard: So, you sort of act as a carbohydrate delivery system.\nPenny: Yeah, call it whatever you want, I get minimum wage. Yeah, anyways, I was wondering if you could help me out with something, I was\u2026.\nLeonard: Yes.\nPenny: Oh. Okay, great, I\u2019m having some furniture delivered tomorrow, and I may not be here, so\u2026. (apartment door opens, Sheldon, Raj and Howard appear) Oh! Hel\u2026hello!\nHoward: (speaks a phrase in Russian).\nPenny: I\u2019m sorry?\nHoward: Haven\u2019t you ever been told how beautiful you are in flawless Russian?\nPenny: No, I haven\u2019t.\nHoward: Get used to it.\nPenny: Yeah, I probably won\u2019t, but\u2026 Hey Sheldon.\nSheldon: Hi.\nPenny: Hey Raj! (Raj looks uncomfortable) Still not talking to me, huh?\nSheldon: Don\u2019t take it personally, it\u2019s his pathology, he can\u2019t talk to women.\nHoward: He can\u2019t talk to attractive women, or in your case a cheesecake\u2013scented Goddess!\nLeonard: So, there\u2019s gonna be some furniture delivered?\nPenny: Yeah, yeah, if it gets here and I\u2019m not here tomorrow could you just sign for it and have them put it in my apartment.\nLeonard: Yeah, no problem.\nPenny: Great, here\u2019s my spare key. Thank you.\nLeonard: Penny, wait.\nPenny: Yeah?\nLeonard: Um, if you don\u2019t have any other plans, do you want to join us for Thai food and a Superman movie marathon?\nPenny: A marathon? Wow, how many Superman movies are there?\nSheldon: You\u2019re kidding, right?\nPenny: Yeah, I do like the one where Lois Lane falls from the helicopter and Superman swooshes down and catches her, which one was that? \nLeonard,Sheldon and Howard together: One. (Raj raises one finger). \nSheldon: You realise that scene was rife with scientific inaccuracy.\nPenny: Yes, I know, men can\u2019t fly.\nSheldon: Oh no, let\u2019s assume that they can. Lois Lane is falling, accelerating at an initial rate of 32 feet per second per second. Superman swoops down to save her by reaching out two arms of steel. Miss Lane, who is now travelling at approximately 120 miles per hour, hits them, and is immediately sliced into three equal pieces. \nLeonard: Unless, Superman matches her speed and decelerates. \nSheldon: In what space, sir, in what space? She\u2019s two feet above the ground. Frankly, if he really loved her, he\u2019d let her hit the pavement. It would be a more merciful death.\nLeonard: Excuse me, your entire argument is predicated on the assumption that Superman\u2019s flight is a feat of strength.\nSheldon: Are you listening to yourself, it is well established that Superman\u2019s flight is a feat of strength, it is an extension of his ability to leap tall buildings, an ability he derives from Earth\u2019s yellow Sun.\nHoward: Yeah, and you don\u2019t have a problem with that, how does he fly at night.\nSheldon: Uh, a combination of the moon\u2019s solar reflection and the energy storage capacity of Kryptonian skin cells.\nPenny: I\u2019m just going to go wash up.\nLeonard: I have 26 hundred comic books in there, I challenge you to find a single reference to Kryptonian skin cells.\nSheldon: Challenge accepted. (Tries door.) We\u2019re locked out.\nRaj: Also, the pretty girl left.\nCredit sequence.\nScene: Ground floor hallway of the apartment building. Leonard is signing for the delivery.\nLeonard: Okay, her apartment\u2019s on the fourth floor but the elevator\u2019s broken so you\u2019re going to have to (delivery man leaves) oh, you\u2019re just going to be done, okay, cool, thanks. I guess we\u2019ll just bring it up ourselves.\nSheldon: I hardly think so. \nLeonard: Why not?\nSheldon: Well, we don\u2019t have a dolly, or lifting belts, or any measurable upper body strength.\nLeonard: We don\u2019t need strength, we\u2019re physicists. We are the intellectual descendents of Archimedes. Give me a fulcrum and a lever and I can move the Earth, it\u2019s just a matter\u2026 (starts to move package) I don\u2019t have this\u2026 I don\u2019t have this I don\u2019t have this.\nSheldon: Archimedes would be so proud.\nLeonard: Do you have any ideas?\nSheldon: Yes, but they all involve a green lantern and a power ring.\nTime shift, Leonard and Sheldon are now lowering the package onto the bottom of the stairs.\nLeonard: Easy, easy (package falls) Okay! Now we\u2019ve got an inclined plane. The force required to lift is reduced by the sine of the angle of the stairs, call it thirty degrees, so about half. \nSheldon: Exactly half.\nLeonard (snarkily): Exactly half. Let\u2019s push. Okay, see, it\u2019s moving, this is easy, all in the math. \nSheldon: What\u2019s your formula for the corner.\nLeonard: What? Oh, okay, uh, okay, yeah, no problem, just come up here and help me pull and turn.\n(Sheldon heads up the stairs. The package slides back down to the bottom.)\nSheldon: Ah, gravity, thou art a heartless bitch.\nTime shift, they now have the package on an upstairs hallway, not their own.\nSheldon: You do understand that our efforts here will in no way increase the odds of you having sexual congress with this woman?\nLeonard: Men do things for women without expecting sex.\nSheldon: Yeah, those are men who just had sex.\nLeonard: I\u2019m doing this to be a good neighbour. In any case, there\u2019s no way it could lower the odds.\nQuick cut to the hallway of their floor, they are nearing the top of the staircase.\nLeonard: Almost there, almost there, almost there. (Lets go of package, it starts to slip down)\nSheldon: No we\u2019re not, no we\u2019re not, no we\u2019re not.\nScene: Inside Penny\u2019s apartment. They are laying the package down on the floor.\nSheldon: Watch your fingers. Watch your fingers. Oh God, my fingers!\nLeonard: You okay?\nSheldon: No, it hurt\u2026 (looking around) Great Caesar\u2019s Ghost, look at this place?\nLeonard: So Penny\u2019s a little messy.\nSheldon: A little messy? The Mandelbrot set of complex numbers is a little messy, this is chaos. Excuse me, explain to me an organisational system where a tray of flatware on a couch is valid. I\u2019m just inferring that this is a couch, because the evidence suggests the coffee table\u2019s having a tiny garage sale. \nLeonard: Did it ever occur to you that not everyone has the compulsive need to sort, organise and label the entire world around them?\nSheldon: No.\nLeonard: Well they don\u2019t. Hard as it may be for you to believe, most people don\u2019t sort their breakfast cereal numerically by fibre content.\nSheldon: Excuse me, but I think we\u2019ve both found that helpful at times.\nLeonard: Come on, we should go.\nSheldon: Hang on.\nLeonard: What are you doing?\nSheldon: Straightening up.\nLeonard: Sheldon, this is not your home.\nSheldon: This is not anyone\u2019s home, this is a swirling vortex of entropy.\nLeonard: When the transvestite lived here, you didn\u2019t care how he kept the place.\nSheldon: Because it was immaculate, I mean, you open that man\u2019s closet, it was left to right, evening gowns, cocktail dresses, then his police uniforms.\nLeonard: What were you doing in his closet?\nSheldon: I helped run some cable for a webcam.\nPenny (entering): Hey guys.\nLeonard: Oh, hey Penny, this just arrived, we just brought this up, just now.\nPenny: Great. Was it hard getting it up the stairs?\nSheldon: (sucks in breath)\nLeonard: No.\nSheldon: No?\nLeonard: No.\nSheldon: No.\nLeonard: Well, we\u2019ll get out of your hair.\nPenny: Oh, great, thank you again (she throws her jacket over the back of the sofa).\nSheldon: Penny, I just want you to know that, you don\u2019t have to live like this. I\u2019m here for you.\nPenny: What\u2019s he talking about?\nLeonard: It\u2019s a joke.\nPenny: I don\u2019t get it.\nLeonard: Yeah, he didn\u2019t tell it right.\nScene: Leonard\u2019s bedroom, he is asleep. Sound of door opening and closing somewhere else is heard. Leonard wakes, puts on his glasses and looks at the clock. It is 2:16.\nLeonard: Sheldon?\nScene: The living room. Leonard enters carrying a light sabre.\nLeonard: Sheldon? Hello? \n(Notices front door is open, turns off light sabre.)\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment, penny is sleeping, Sheldon is cleaning. Leonard enters.\nLeonard: Sheldon!\nSheldon: Sssshhhh! Penny\u2019s sleeping.\nLeonard: Are you insane, you can\u2019t just break into a woman\u2019s apartment in the middle of the night and clean.\nSheldon: I had no choice. I couldn\u2019t sleep knowing that just outside my bedroom was our living room, and just outside our living room was that hallway, and immediately adjacent to that hallway was\u2026 this.\nLeonard: Do you realise that if Penny wakes up, there is no reasonable explanation as to why we\u2019re here?\nSheldon: I just gave you a reasonable explanation.\nLeonard: No, no. You gave me an explanation, it\u2019s reasonableness will be determined by a jury of your peers.\nSheldon: Don\u2019t be ridiculous. I have no peers.\nLeonard: Sheldon, we have to get out of here.\n(Penny snores)\nSheldon: You might want to speak in a lower register.\nLeonard: What?\nSheldon: Evolution has made women sensitive to high pitched noises while they sleep, so that they\u2019ll be roused by a crying baby. If you want to avoid waking her, speak in a lower register.\nLeonard: That\u2019s ridiculous. (Penny snores again.)\nSheldon: No, (lowering his voice dramatically,) that\u2019s ridiculous.\nLeonard (doing likewise): Fine. I accept your premise, now please let\u2019s go.\nSheldon: I am not leaving until I\u2019m done.\nLeonard: O-o-o-oh! (Collapses against wall).\nSheldon: If you have time to lean, you have time to clean.\nLeonard: Oh, what the hell.\nScene: Sheldon and Leonard\u2019s living room, morning. Sheldon enters, singing to himself. \nSheldon: Morning.\nLeonard: Morning. \nSheldon: I have to say, I slept splendidly. Granted, not long, but just deeply and well.\nLeonard: I\u2019m not surprised. A well known folk cure for insomnia is to break into your neighbour\u2019s apartment and clean.\nSheldon: Sarcasm?\nLeonard: You think?\nSheldon: Granted, my methods may have been somewhat unorthodox, but I think the end result will be a measurable enhancement of Penny\u2019s quality of life.\nLeonard: You know what, you\u2019ve convinced me, maybe tonight we should sneak in and shampoo her carpet.\nSheldon: You don\u2019t think that crosses a line?\nLeonard: Yes! For God\u2019s sake, Sheldon, do I have to hold up a sarcasm sign every time I open my mouth.\nSheldon: You have a sarcasm sign?\nLeonard: No, I do not have a sarcasm sign.\nSheldon: Do you want some cereal. I\u2019m feeling so good today I\u2019m going to choose from the low fibre end of the shelf. Hello, Honey Puffs.\nPenny (voice off): Son of a Bitch!\nLeonard: Penny\u2019s up.\nPenny (voice off): You sick, geeky bastards!\nLeonard: How did she know it was us?\nSheldon: I may have left a suggested organisational schematic for her bedroom closet.\nPenny (voice off): Leonard!\nLeonard: God, this is going to be bad.\nSheldon: Goodbye, Honey Puffs, hello Big Bran.\nPenny (entering): You came into my apartment last night when I was sleeping?\nLeonard: Yes, but, only to clean.\nSheldon: Really more to organise, you\u2019re not actually dirty, per se.\nPenny: Give me back my key.\nLeonard: I\u2019m very, very sorry.\nPenny: Do you understand how creepy this is.\nLeonard: Oh, yes, we discussed it at length last night.\nPenny: In my apartment, while I was sleeping.\nSheldon: And snoring. And that\u2019s probably just a sinus infection, but it could be sleep apnoea, you might want to see an otolaryngologist. It\u2019s a throat doctor.\nPenny: And what kind of doctor removes shoes from asses?\nSheldon: Depending on the depth, that\u2019s either a proctologist or a general surgeon. (Leonard holds up a sign reading \u201cSarcasm\u201d) Oh!\nPenny: God!\nLeonard: Okay, look, no Penny, I think what you\u2019re feeling is perfectly valid, and maybe a little bit later today when you\u2019re feeling a little bit less, for lack of a better word, violated, maybe we could talk about this some more.\nPenny: Stay away from me.\nLeonard: Sure, that\u2019s another way to go.\nSheldon: Penny, Penny, just to clarify because there will be a discussion when you leave, is your objection solely to our presence in the apartment while you were sleeping, or do you also object to the imposition of a new organisational paradigm. (Penny stares in disbelief, then leaves.) Well that was a little non-responsive.\nLeonard: You are going to march yourself over there right now and apologise. (Sheldon laughs.) What\u2019s funny?\nSheldon: That wasn\u2019t sarcasm?\nLeonard: No.\nSheldon: Wooh, boy, you are all over the place this morning. (Knocks on Penny\u2019s door.) I have a masters and two PhD\u2019s, I should not have to do this.\nPenny (opening door): What?\nSheldon: I am truly sorry for what happened last night, I take full responsibility. And I hope that it won\u2019t colour your opinion of Leonard, who is not only a wonderful guy, but also, I hear, a gentle and thorough lover. (Penny closes door in his face.) I did what I could.\nScene: The stairwell. Raj is coming up the stairs, he meets Penny who is going down.\nPenny: Hey Raj. (Raj stands looking uncomfortable.) Hey, listen, I don\u2019t know if you heard about what happened last night with Leonard and Sheldon, but I\u2019m really upset about it, I mean they just, they let themselves into my place, and then they cleaned it, I mean can you even believe that? How weird is that?\nRaj (internally, while Penny continues to talk): Ooh, she\u2019s standing very close to me. Oh my, she does smell good. What is that, vanilla?\nPenny: You know, where I come from, someone comes into your house at night, you shoot, okay? And you don\u2019t shoot to wound. I mean, alright, my sister shot her husband, but it was an accident, they were drunk. What was I saying?\nRaj (internally): She\u2019s so chatty. Maybe my parents are right. Maybe I\u2019d be better off with an Indian girl. We\u2019d have the same cultural background, and my wife would sing to my children the same lullabies my mother sang to me. \nPenny: It\u2019s obvious that they meant well, but I\u2019m just, I\u2019m having a really rough time, like I said, I broke up with my boyfriend, and it\u2019s just freaking me out.\nRaj (internally sings an Indian lullaby.)\nPenny: I mean, just because most of the men I\u2019ve known in my life happen to be jerks, doesn\u2019t mean I should just assume Leonard and Sheldon are. Right?\nRaj (internally): She asked me a question. I should probably nod. (Does.)\nPenny: That\u2019s exactly what I thought. Thank you for listening. You\u2019re a doll. (She hugs him.)\nRaj (internally): Oh-oh. Turn your pelvis. (Does.)\nScene: Sheldon and Leonard\u2019s living room. Howard is there, playing on a dance video game. \nHoward (jumping off game mat): Grab a napkin, homie. You just got served. \nLeonard: It\u2019s fine. You win.\nHoward: What\u2019s his problem?\nSheldon: His imaginary girlfriend broke up with him.\nHoward: Been there.\nRaj (entering): Hello. Sorry I\u2019m late. But I was in the hallway, chatting up Penny.\nHoward: Really? You? Rajesh Koothrapali, spoke to Penny?\nRaj: Actually, I was less the chatter than the chattee.\nLeonard: What did she say? Is she still mad at me?\nRaj: Well, she was upset at first, but, probably because her sister shot somebody. Then there was something about you and\u2026 then she hugged me.\nHoward: She hugged you? How did she hug you? (Raj hugs Howard.) Is that her perfume I smell?\nRaj: intoxicating, isn\u2019t it?\nScene: The hallway, Leonard puts a note under Penny\u2019s door. It opens.\nPenny: Hi.\nLeonard: Oh.\nPenny: What\u2019s going on?\nLeonard: Um, here\u2019s the thing. (Reads from note.) Penny. Just as Oppenheimer came to regret his contributions to the first atomic bomb, so too I regret my participation in what was, at the very least, an error in judgement. The hallmark of the great human experiment is the willingness to recognise one\u2019s mistakes. Some mistakes, such as Madame Curie\u2019s discovery of Radium turned out to have great scientific potential even though she would later die a slow, painful death from radiation poisoning. Another example, from the field of ebola research\u2026.\nPenny: Leonard.\nLeonard: Yeah.\nPenny (hugs him): We\u2019re okay. (Kisses him on cheek. Closes door. Leonard looks happy, walks back across hallway and straight into the apartment door.)\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment. Sheldon and Leonard are trying to construct furniture.\nLeonard: Six two inch dowels.\nSheldon: Check.\nLeonard: One package, Phillips head screws.\nSheldon: Check.\nPenny: Guys, seriously, I grew up on a farm, okay, I rebuilt a tractor engine when I was like twelve, I think I can put together a cheap Swedish media centre. \nLeonard: No, please, we insist, it\u2019s the least we can do considering. \nSheldon: Considering what? How great this place looks?\nHoward (across room with Raj): Oh boy, I was afraid of this.\nLeonard: What?\nHoward: These instructions are a pictographic representation of the least imaginative way to assemble these components. This right here is why Sweden has no space program.\nPenny: Well, uh, it looked pretty good in the store.\nLeonard: It is an inefficient design, for example Penny has a flat screen TV, which means all the space behind it is wasted.\nSheldon: We could put her stereo back there.\nLeonard: And control it how?\nSheldon: Run an infra-red repeater, photocell here, emitter here, easy peasy. \nHoward (after Raj whispers in his ear): Good point, how you gonna cool it?\nPenny: Hey guys, I got this. \nSheldon: Hang on Penny. How about fans, here and here?\nLeonard: Also inefficient, and might be loud.\nHoward: How about liquid coolant? Maybe a little aquarium pump here, run some quarter inch PVC\u2026\nPenny: Guys, this is actually really simple.\nHoward: Hold on, honey, men at work. The PVC comes down here, maybe a little corrugated sheet metal as a radiator here.\nLeonard: Oh, really, show me where we put a drip tray, a sluice and an overflow reservoir?\nSheldon: And if water is involved we\u2019re going to have to ground the crap out of the thing. \nPenny: Guys, it\u2019s hot in here, I think I\u2019ll just take off all my clothes. \nLeonard: Oh, I\u2019ve got it. How about if we replace panels A, B and F and crossbar H with aircraft grade aluminium. \nSheldon: Right, then the entire thing\u2019s one big heat sink.\nHoward: Perfect, Leonard, why don\u2019t you and Sheldon go down to the junk yard and pick up about six square metres of scrap aluminium, Raj and I will run down to my lab and get the oxy-acetaline torch.\nLeonard: Meet back here in an hour?\nHoward: Done.\nLeonard: Got it. (They all leave).\nPenny: Okay, this place does look pretty good.\nTeleplay: Robert Cohen & Dave Goetsch\nStory: Chuck Lorre & Bill Prady\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "9_12": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: I\u2019m glad to see you made it safely. How\u2019s your hotel?\nAmy (on Skype): It\u2019s not the best Best Western I\u2019ve been to, but I\u2019d say it\u2019s the third best Best Western I\u2019ve been to.\nSheldon: I know how you feel. The Best Buy by my house is only the third best Best Buy. They have the best buys, but having the best buys isn\u2019t the only thing that makes a Best Buy the best Best Buy.\nAmy: What makes a best Best Buy the best Best Buy?\nSheldon: Mm, that\u2019s a great question. I like when they\u2019re next to a Chipotle.\nAmy: Okay, well, I should unpack.\nSheldon: All right. Enjoy the neurobiology conference.\nAmy: I will. I wish you were here.\nSheldon: At a neurobiology conference? What a mean thing to say.\nAmy: Okay, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re not here?\nSheldon: Aw, you always know just what to say after I tell you what to say.\nAmy: Good-bye, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Bye. Oh, good news, gentlemen. Amy\u2019s at a conference this weekend, which means I\u2019m available to be entertained, hmm. As today\u2019s youth might put it, who wants to get their Sheld-on?\nHoward: Bernie and I are getting the house ready for the remodel. We could always use an extra pair of hands.\nSheldon: That sounds awful. Raj?\nRaj: Uh, I\u2019ve got time booked in the telescope room all weekend scanning for rogue planets. You\u2019re more than welcome to join me.\nSheldon: That\u2019s the one to beat. Leonard?\nLeonard: Oh, if anything, I\u2019m trying to get my Sheld-off.\nSheldon: Well, then it looks like we have a winner. Congratulations.\nRaj: Well, I should warn you, it\u2019s just looking at data for hours and hours on a computer screen.\nSheldon: Uh, stop selling it, kid. You won.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The apartment.\nPenny: Hey.\nLeonard: Hey.\nRaj: Hello.\nHoward: Hi.\nLeonard: How was your day?\nPenny: Oh, not good. Still couldn\u2019t get in to see Dr. Gallo.\nSheldon: A doctor? Well, I hope you\u2019re not contagious. I\u2019ve got a weekend in the telescope room I\u2019ve been excited about for almost three minutes.\nPenny: I\u2019m not sick. It\u2019s for work. There\u2019s this doctor who refuses to see any sales reps. I\u2019ve been trying to get in for months.\nLeonard: Well, did you try wearing the shirt I said was inappropriate for work?\nPenny: Well, the doctor\u2019s a woman, but yes, because you never know.\nHoward: What kind of doctor is she?\nPenny: Um, a psychiatrist. Why?\nHoward: Well, what if you make an appointment as a patient? Then you\u2019ll get to talk to her.\nPenny: Yeah, they already know I\u2019m a pharmaceutical sales rep.\nRaj: Oh. What if Leonard made an appointment and tried to lay some groundwork for you?\nPenny: That\u2019s interesting.\nLeonard: I\u2019m not gonna make a fake appointment with a psychiatrist. What would I say is wrong with me?\nRaj: Low self-esteem.\nHoward: Social anxiety.\nSheldon: Sexual insecurity.\nLeonard: None of that is true.\nPenny: Uh, denial. See, sweetie, the list goes on and on.\nLeonard: That\u2019s just crazy. How would my going in there even help you?\nPenny: I don\u2019t know. You could talk to her, and maybe if it comes up, you could ask if she\u2019s heard about the drug.\nLeonard: What if I get caught?\nHoward: Fear of failure.\nRaj: Lack of confidence.\nSheldon: Kind of a wuss.\nLeonard: Fine, I\u2019ll do it. But not because of them, because I love you.\nPenny: Thank you.\nRaj: Pushover.\nHoward: Spineless.\nSheldon: Still hasn\u2019t bought milk even though I told him two days ago.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s bedroom.\nHoward: That was incredible.\nBernadette: It was. I just wish Stuart wasn\u2019t around so we didn\u2019t have to be so quiet.\nHoward: I know. It\u2019s not like he returns the favour when he watches his Japanese porn cartoons.\nStuart (knocking): You guys got a minute, or are you still cuddling?\nHoward: What is it, Stuart?\nStuart: Can I come in?\nHoward: Hang on. Should I send him away?\nBernadette: No, it\u2019s okay.\nStuart: Thanks, Bernie.\nHoward: What\u2019s up?\nStuart: Uh, well, I know the remodel is coming up, so I thought I\u2019d make it easy on you guys and find my own place.\nHoward: Wow. I thought I was done getting lucky tonight.\nBernadette: So, when are you thinking of moving?\nStuart: Uh, actually, I already found an apartment, so in a couple of days.\nBernadette: Oh. Okay. Sorry to see you go?\nStuart: Okay, well, thank you guys for everything. I, I really appreciate it.\nBernadette: : You\u2019re very welcome.\nStuart: Hmm.\nHoward: What?\nStuart: Hmm, I just have never been in this room while you\u2019re awake.\nScene: The telescope room.\nSheldon: What are you doing?\nRaj: Uh, making sure the telescope\u2019s camera is white-field balanced.\nSheldon: Hmm. What are you doing now?\nRaj: Still making sure the telescope\u2019s camera is white-field balanced.\nSheldon: Oh, I see. How about now?\nRaj: Now I\u2019m making sure the telescope\u2019s camera is white-field balanced and wishing you had a colouring book.\nSheldon: Well, I can be helpful. Give me something to do. You know, my father took me to work once, and in ten minutes I figured out who\u2019d been stealing from the cash register. It was my father. Yeah, Dad lost his job, but Mr. Hinckley gave me a Fudgsicle.\nRaj: Fine, you want something to do? There\u2019s about six months of data on this hard drive. Why don\u2019t you go through it and see if you can spot any patterns or anomalies.\nSheldon: Yep, I\u2019m on it. Hey, look at that, an Indian guy outsourcing a computer job to a white fella.\nRaj: Yeah, okay, whatever it takes to keep you busy for a few hours.\nSheldon: Found one.\nRaj: No, you didn\u2019t. There are millions of data points there.\nSheldon: But, look, an optical transient.\nRaj: Yeah, maybe that is something. How did you find that?\nSheldon: It wasn\u2019t difficult. You know how when you see prime numbers, they appear red, but when they\u2019re twin primes, they\u2019re pink and smell like gasoline?\nRaj: No.\nSheldon: Oh. I guess I\u2019m a special boy. You know, sometimes when a boy is special, he gets a Fudgsicle. Which, by the way, tastes like the speed of light.\nScene: Dr Gallo\u2019s office.\nLeonard: Thank you for seeing me on such short notice.\nDr Gallo: Ah, it\u2019s my pleasure. I\u2019m curious, are you related to Dr. Beverly Hofstadter?\nLeonard: Uh, she\u2019s my mother. You know her?\nDr Gallo: No, not personally, but I have read all of her books.\nLeonard: Well, then you know her better than I do.\nDr Gallo: Well, I\u2019m not so sure about that. But I can tell you I do not agree with her theories on child rearing at all.\nLeonard: Really? Any chance you find them cold, cruel and unsuitable for innocent little boys who just want to be happy?\nDr Gallo: Well, I didn\u2019t want to say it.\nLeonard: No, no, say it. Sing it. Rent a plane, write it in the sky.\nDr Gallo: Sounds like you\u2019re holding on to quite a bit of anger towards her.\nLeonard: Oh, no, I, I\u2019ve worked through a lot of that stuff, I\u2019m better now.\nDr Gallo: Mm. Good for you.\nLeonard: Do you know she never let me celebrate my birthday because being born was her achievement, not mine?\nDr Gallo: That\u2019s heartbreaking.\nLeonard: Right? To this day, I send her a card every year with a little money in it.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s house.\nHoward: You know, once we get the house back to ourselves, we can be romantic in any room we want.\nBernadette: Great. I can finally show you where the laundry room is.\nStuart: Boy, who would\u2019ve thought when you asked me to move in and help take care of your mom, I\u2019d still be here two years later?\nHoward: No one.\nBernadette: Nobody thought that.\nStuart: Well, that\u2019s it.\nBernadette: I guess so.\nStuart: This is weird.\nHoward: Yeah. A grown man moving into his own apartment. Crazy times. See ya.\nBernadette: Ignore him. He\u2019s just using humour to express how happy he is.\nStuart: It\u2019s okay. I know he loves me.\nBernadette: Sure he does. Well, let us know when you\u2019re all settled in.\nStuart: I will. And I really can\u2019t thank you guys enough.\nBernadette: Our pleasure.\nStuart: Bye.\nBernadette: Goodbye.\nHoward: He\u2019s gone. Let\u2019s start in the garage.\nScene: The telescope room.\nRaj: Okay, so once we receive the next image and compare it to the ones we\u2019ve already collected, we\u2019ll know what it is that we found.\nSheldon: Ooh, perhaps it\u2019s a Heliosheath scintillation.\nRaj: It could be a trans-Neptunian object.\nSheldon: Maybe it\u2019s a new planet.\nRaj: Unlikely, but it could be a dwarf planet.\nSheldon: Well, as long as it has a healthy gravity and all its moons, I\u2019ll be happy.\nRaj: Okay, the final image is coming in. And the object we discovered is\u2026\nSheldon: Come on, Daddy needs a livable planet he can rule with an iron fist.\nRaj: A medium-sized asteroid.\nSheldon: That\u2019s it? How common. That\u2019s the chicken fingers on the menu of space.\nRaj: I kind of like chicken fingers.\nSheldon: Yeah, me, too. I was stuck for a metaphor.\nRaj: Come on, a medium-sized asteroid is still an interesting discovery.\nSheldon: I suppose it could end up on a collision course with Earth and destroy life as we know it.\nRaj: You dream different than me.\nSheldon: It is kind of cute.\nRaj: Yeah, it is. And you know we get to name it.\nSheldon: We better choose a name no one can make fun of. Sir Frederick William Herschel didn\u2019t do Uranus any favours.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: Hi.\nPenny: Hey, how\u2019d it go?\nLeonard: Oh, great. Dr. Gallo is terrific. You know, I, I\u2019ve always been insecure that no one cares about what I have to say, but she made me see\u2026\nPenny: Yeah, no one cares. Did you help me out or not?\nLeonard: Okay, now, what I\u2019m hearing is that you feel that I sometimes take too long to express myself, and you wish I\u2019d be more succinct.\nPenny: You\u2019re only hearing that because I cannot roll my eyes any louder.\nLeonard: All right, well, after we talked about my issues with my mother, nothing too deep, just how she ruined my life, I told her about you and your drug. She said she\u2019d be happy to meet you.\nPenny: Really? Oh, you\u2019re the best husband ever.\nLeonard: So you\u2019ll go to the Doctor Who convention with me next week?\nPenny: I guess.\nLeonard: Oh, I actually did hear your eyes roll that time.\nScene: Stuarts former bedroom in Howard and Bernadette\u2019s house.\nBernadette: Boy, when was the last time Stuart cleaned this place?\nHoward: No kidding. Oh, okay, I\u2019m about to suck something up. What do you think this object sounds like?\nBernadette: Howie, I don\u2019t want to play Lego, Toenail or Pill anymore. So, what do you think we should do with this room?\nHoward: Well, I was thinking a home theatre or a gaming room, you know, like a man cave.\nBernadette: Why can\u2019t it be a woman cave?\nHoward: As long as it has a home theatre, a video game system and you\u2019re not allowed in it, you can call it whatever you want.\nBernadette: I\u2019m being serious.\nHoward: Well, what do you think we should do?\nBernadette: I don\u2019t know, maybe a home office or, oh look. The teddy bear Stuart won the night we took him to the fair.\nHoward: Oh. He was so excited.\nBernadette: Yeah. You know, no matter how hard they tried, they could not guess his age.\nHoward: I\u2019ll give it to him next time I see him.\nBernadette: Have you heard from him since he left?\nHoward: No. You\u2019d think he would\u2019ve called once he got settled in.\nBernadette: Hmm. Maybe he\u2019s busy.\nHoward: Too busy to call? He wasn\u2019t too busy to binge-watch Hot in Cleveland with my Hulu password. What is happening? Are we missing him?\nBernadette: No, that\u2019s not what this feeling is. Is it?\nHoward: Of course not. He drove us crazy. Like when you were gonna make that pie and Stuart ate all the blueberries.\nBernadette: And he tried to deny it, but his teeth were all purple.\nHoward: That was pretty cute.\nBernadette: Yeah. Ew, we are missing him!\nScene: The apartment.\nRaj: So I was thinking, maybe we can come up with a name for the asteroid by combining our names.\nSheldon: That\u2019s a great idea. I\u2019ve got it. We\u2019ll call it Cooper.\nRaj: How is that both our names?\nSheldon: Koo from Koothrappali and per from Cooper.\nRaj: Yeah, s-so it\u2019s, like, Kooper with a K?\nSheldon: Nah, you\u2019re right, that\u2019s dumb.\nLeonard: Hey.\nSheldon: Oh, Leonard, great news. We discovered a medium-sized asteroid together.\nLeonard: Wow, that\u2019s amazing. I\u2019m in a pretty great mood today myself.\nSheldon: Okay. Guess we\u2019re gonna talk about you now.\nLeonard: Well, we are, because Dr. Gallo made me realize that I\u2019m a worthwhile person and that my feelings matter.\nRaj: I learned that for free from a cat poster, but good for you.\nSheldon: Okay, back to me. I discovered an asteroid, and now I get to name it.\nRaj: Wait, what happened to us?\nSheldon: Now, this isn\u2019t about us, this is about what\u2019s best for the asteroid.\nLeonard: Well, what are you thinking of naming it?\nSheldon: I haven\u2019t settled on anything yet.\nRaj: We haven\u2019t settled on anything yet.\nSheldon: All right, way to go, Cat Poster. You hang in there.\nLeonard: You know what\u2019d be nice? Name it after your girlfriends. Show them how much you care.\nRaj: That is a great idea.\nSheldon: It\u2019s perfect. It appears romantic, but it\u2019s really just a rock in space that gets me out of Valentine\u2019s Day forever.\nRaj: So, uh, what were you thinking? Combine their names?\nSheldon: I like it. Yeah, we\u2019ll take the A-M from Amy and, uh, the Y from Emily.\nRaj: That\u2019s just Amy.\nSheldon: Exactly. See how well we work together?\nScene Dr Gallo\u2019s office. \nPenny: And in double-blind studies, Placinex proved extremely effective in treating all kinds of anxiety. Actually, funny story, the boys in the lab were worried about getting FDA approval for Placinex. They started taking it, stopped worrying.\nDr Gallo: Got it.\nPenny: Uh, do you have any questions?\nDr Gallo: Just one.\nPenny: Mm-hmm?\nDr Gallo: When you made your husband pretend to be a patient so you could get access to me, what were you thinking there?\nPenny: I just meant a question about the drug.\nDr Gallo: Yeah, I know what you meant. Let\u2019s put that aside for a minute and talk about why you married Leonard.\nPenny: I don\u2019t wanna.\nDr Gallo: Here is a man raised by an overbearing woman who completely dominated every aspect of his formative years. Do you think he\u2019s perpetuating that relationship by seeking out a partner like you?\nPenny: You know, I used to wear tank tops a lot. That was a big selling point.\nScene: The apartment.\nAmy (on Skype): Hi, Sheldon. What\u2019s up?\nSheldon: Good news. You\u2019re an asteroid.\nAmy: Uh, please tell me what to say next.\nSheldon: Perhaps I should explain. While working with Koothrappali, we discovered an asteroid, and I named it after you.\nAmy: Oh. Sheldon, thank you. That\u2019s so romantic. But what about Rajesh? He was okay with you choosing the name?\nSheldon: Well, it took a little negotiating, but I wore him down. Uh, we get the asteroid, and if you and I have children, they all have to be named Rajesh.\nAmy: All of them?\nSheldon: Even the girls.\nAmy: Okay, I think I know what to say now.\nScene: Dr Gallo\u2019s office. \nPenny: How can I not sound like his mother when our entire bedroom is filled with Star Wars toys? I mean, have you ever had sex with a stuffed Wookiee watching you?\nDr Gallo: I went to college in the \u201970s. It was a hairier time. I\u2019m gonna say yes.\nPenny: You know, if anything, he\u2019s turning me into his mother. Before I did pharmaceutical sales, I was an actress. You know, I was pretty good. You know, girl-next-door type, but hot. Doable.\nDr Gallo: Hmm.\nPenny: And not only am I Leonard\u2019s mother, but we have this man-child living with us named Sheldon.\nDr Gallo: Oh, Leonard talked a lot about him. I wasn\u2019t sure if he was real.\nPenny: Yeah, he\u2019s as real as the fine I get when I use too much toilet paper.\nDr Gallo: Wow, you really do have a lot on your plate.\nPenny: I do. You know, Leonard\u2019s right. Talking to you is really helping.\nDr Gallo: Oh, I\u2019m glad. You know, you might also benefit from a prescription for anxiety.\nPenny: Okay, if you think it\u2019ll help. Oh, just don\u2019t make it Placinex. I do not need sudden fits of homicidal rage.\nScene: The apartment.\nAmy (on Skype): I miss you.\nSheldon: I miss you as well.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s house.\nHoward: I can\u2019t believe I miss Stuart.\nScene: Dr Gallo\u2019s office.\nPenny: I guess I just miss when life was simpler.\nScene: A street. Leonard is skipping ropes with some young girls. \nGirls: Go, Leonard! Go, Leonard! Go, Leonard! Go, Leonard!\nLeonard: Remember, girls, you decide what makes you happy, not your emotionally withholding mothers.\nGirls: Go, Leonard! Go, Leonard! Go, Leonard! Go, Leonard! Go, Leonard!\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s bedroom. Howard and Bernadette are asleep.\nStuart: I really miss this.\n\u00a0\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "7_4": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: So what\u2019d you think?\nAmy: It was good.\nSheldon: That\u2019s it? Good\u201d\nAmy: I enjoyed it. When you told me I was going to be losing my virginity, I didn\u2019t think you meant showing me Raiders of the Lost Ark for the first time.\nSheldon: My apologies. I chose my words poorly. I should have said you were about to have your world rocked on my couch. Anyway, thank you for watching it. It\u2019s one of my all-time favourites.\nAmy: It was very entertaining despite the glaring story problem.\nSheldon: Story problem? You, oh, Amy, what a dewy-eyed moon-calf you are. Raiders of the Lost Ark is the love child of Steven Spielberg and George Lucas, two of the most gifted filmmakers of our generation. I\u2019ve watched it 36 times, except for the snake scene and the face-melting scene, which I can only watch when it\u2019s still light out, but, I defy you to find a story problem. Here\u2019s my jaw, drop it.\nAmy: All right. Indiana Jones plays no role in the outcome of the story. If he weren\u2019t in the film, it would turn out exactly the same.\nSheldon: Oh, I see your confusion. You don\u2019t understand. Indiana Jones was the one in the hat with the whip.\nAmy: No, I do, and if he weren\u2019t in the movie, the Nazis would have still found the ark, taken it to the island, opened it up and all died, just like they did. Let me close that for ya.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The foyer.\nLeonard: Hey.\nPenny: Hi. I thought you went to the comic book store on Wednesdays.\nLeonard: Yeah, but Sheldon and Amy were having date night and they don\u2019t need me there to make it awkward. They have each other for that. So, how was school?\nPenny: Oh, good. Check it out, The Disappointing Child by Beverly Hofstadter.\nLeonard: You bought my mom\u2019s book?\nPenny: Yeah. It\u2019s on the recommended reading list for my psychology class.\nLeonard: Oh, come on. Not that book. It, it\u2019s got, like, every horrible story from my childhood in it.\nPenny: Oh, cool. Are there pictures?\nLeonard: Seriously, please find another book.\nPenny: Oh, come on. Why? How bad could it be?\nLeonard: There, there\u2019s chapters about potty training, and bed-wetting and masturbation. Basically, if something came out of me, she wrote about it. You know what? Do whatever you want, just don\u2019t talk to me about it.\nPenny: Not even the chapter on the breast-feeding crisis?\nLeonard: It was not a crisis. Apparently, I favoured the left one, she got a little lopsided.\nPenny: Oh, my God, you still go left.\nScene: The cafeteria.\nRaj: Which celebrity would you say I look like the most?\nHoward: Halle Berry. Why?\nRaj: Stuart and I are putting dating profiles online, and it\u2019s one of the questions. And thank you, I\u2019d kill for that woman\u2019s bone structure.\nLeonard: Why are you reading Pride and Prejudice?\nSheldon: I\u2019ll tell you why. Amy ruined Raiders of the Lost Ark for me, so now I\u2019m trying to find something beloved to her and ruin that.\nHoward: Because her life wasn\u2019t enough?\nRaj: Wait, how can, how can anyone ruin Raiders? It\u2019s perfect.\nSheldon: Yeah, except for the fact that Indiana Jones is completely irrelevant to the story. With or without him, the Nazis find the ark, open it and die.\nAll: Aw!\nHoward: Hey, wait a minute. No, the Nazis were digging in the wrong place. The only reason they got the ark was because Indy found it first.\nLeonard: Actually, they were only digging in the wrong place because Indy had the medallion. Without him, they would have had the medallion and dug in the right place.\nAll: Aw!\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment.\nPenny: Okay, I know you don\u2019t want to talk about it, but can I just ask you one question about your mom\u2019s book?\nLeonard: No.\nPenny: I just want to know why a five-year-old boy puts on his mom\u2019s make-up and wears balloon boobies.\nLeonard: They weren\u2019t boobies, they were muscles. And the make-up was green. I was pretending to be The Hulk.\nPenny: You were wearing her bra.\nLeonard: That was to keep my muscles from sagging. Can we please stop talking about this?\nPenny: Okay, okay. But you know, as a student of psychology who got a check-plus on her first homework assignment, I think, sometimes, it\u2019s good to open up about these things.\nLeonard: Okay, fine. Do you want to know why I dressed like The Hulk? Because I was always mad at my mom and I wanted to smash my way out of that house.\nPenny: Well, why were you so angry?\nLeonard: Gee, I don\u2019t know. Maybe it\u2019s because I was always the subject of her little experiments. Did you get to the chapter where she staged the Easter egg hunt with no eggs to see how long I\u2019d keep looking? The answer, by the way, June.\nPenny: Sweetie, I\u2019m so sorry. I wish there was something I could do to make you feel better.\nLeonard: I do, too, but there\u2019s not.\nPenny: Really? Are you sure about that?\nLeonard: Of course, who am I to argue with a check-plus student? Just warning you, I\u2019m gonna go right. Don\u2019t make a big deal out of it.\nScene: Raj\u2019s apartment.\nStuart: Is make-up really necessary?\nRaj: Well, when someone looks at your dating profile, the first thing they see is your picture. I just want to make sure you look fun and full of life and not like a body they just pulled out of the river. All right, here we go, and smile. Okay, uh-uh, that one\u2019s in the bank. How about this? Turn away, and then turn back into it. But when you do, imagine the camera is the girl you want to meet.\nStuart: You got it.\nRaj: Okay, uh, let\u2019s try it again. Uh, but this time, pretend the girl you want to meet doesn\u2019t want to hurt you.\nStuart: I don\u2019t think I can give you that.\nRaj: Come on. One more time. Yeah, it\u2019s, it\u2019s a little blurry, but I think that works in your favour. Do you want a beer?\nStuart: Sure. Hey, have you finished writing your profile yet?\nRaj: Almost. Oh, what did you put as the one-word description of yourself?\nStuart: I put unobjectionable. But now that I hear it out loud, it just seems like I\u2019m being cocky. What did you put for your best feature?\nRaj: My parents\u2019 money. Uh, what did you put for your best feature?\nStuart: I put: not applicable.\nRaj: Come on, dude, you\u2019re being too hard on yourself. You\u2019ve got a lot of good stuff going on.\nStuart: Really? Like what?\nRaj: Well, okay, you\u2019re a, you\u2019re a talented artist, you own your own business.\nStuart: Neither of those things have ever helped me meet a woman.\nRaj: Okay, well, can we imply that you\u2019re well-endowed?\nStuart: I do have one oddly long testicle.\nRaj: Okay, now you\u2019re talking like a winner!\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: Whatcha doin\u2019?\nSheldon: Oh, it turns out Amy\u2019s beloved Pride and Prejudice is a flawless masterpiece. He\u2019s got too much pride, she\u2019s got too much prejudice, it just works.\nLeonard: So you\u2019re looking to ruin something for her in the funny pages?\nSheldon: Amy has a fondness for the comic strip Marmaduke.\nLeonard: Mm-hmm. And?\nSheldon: And I think I\u2019ve got it. Consider, a family possesses a dog that is so large and poorly disciplined, he causes nothing but problems. Why do they keep him?\nLeonard: Maybe they fell in love with him as a puppy and didn\u2019t know how big he was gonna be.\nSheldon: Of course. You know, why couldn\u2019t she just like Ziggy? Yeah? That thing\u2019s riddled with plot holes.\nLeonard: Sorry, buddy.\nSheldon: Ooh, I think she\u2019s a fan of Garfield as well. Oh, darn it, now so am I.\nLeonard: I\u2019ll see you later. I gotta go watch a stupid football game with Penny.\nSheldon: Wait, hang on. You\u2019ve spent time with Amy. Can you think of anything she\u2019s fond of that has a bunch of flaws she hasn\u2019t noticed?\nLeonard: I gotta go.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment. \nLeonard: You ready to go?\nPenny: Yep. Hey, and maybe this time you don\u2019t try and talk sports with the guys.\nLeonard: Some sports bar. It\u2019s like they never even heard of Quidditch. Do we really have to go?\nPenny: Oh, come on. Every time we\u2019re about to hang out with my friends, you don\u2019t want to. It\u2019s like, It\u2019s too loud, or the bathroom\u2019s too dirty, or they put a chicken wing in my ear. I mean\u2026\nLeonard: Well, you\u2019re, you\u2019re right. Let\u2019s just go.\nPenny: Hey, what\u2019s going on with you?\nLeonard: Nothing, I\u2019m fine.\nPenny: All right, hang on. is this still about your mom\u2019s book?\nLeonard: No. Not everything is about my mom. \nPenny: \u2018Cause if you\u2019re still upset about that, we don\u2019t have to go.\nLeonard: Except this is totally about my mom.\nPenny: I\u2019m so sorry. I never should have read that book. You know what? You want to just get dinner and watch the game here?\nLeonard: That sounds nice. Yeah.\nPenny: Okay.\nLeonard: Or, you know, we could get take-out and watch the Blu-ray extended version of The Hobbit movie with commentary track. On account of how sad I am about my mom.\nScene: Leonard\u2019s lab.\nHoward: Leonard, you ready for lunch?\nLeonard: One sec. Hey. Sorry.\nHoward: Hi, Penny.\nPenny: Hi. All right, sweetie. You hang in there today.\nLeonard: I\u2019ll try, but I might be sad again tonight.\nPenny: Okay.\nHoward: Wow. Sex at work?\nLeonard: Leave it alone. That\u2019s my girlfriend.\nHoward: Sorry. \nLeonard: Who just had sex with me at work.\nHoward: Damn. How\u2019d you swing that?\nLeonard: Well, whenever I talk about how awful my mom was, Penny will do anything to make me feel better.\nHoward: Seriously?\nLeonard: Look, I mean, I\u2019m not proud of it, but it does work. I got her to watch a six-part documentary on Monty Python. Even I was bored, I just wanted to see if she\u2019d make it to the end.\nHoward: You sound kind of proud of it.\nLeonard: I am, I\u2019m really proud.\nScene: The apartment.\nAmy (on webcam): Hello, Sheldon. Is everything okay?\nSheldon: Yes. Why?\nAmy: Well, the last time you made an unscheduled video-chat, there was a curly fry in your regular fries and you thought someone might be trying to slip you a mickey.\nSheldon: April 13, a dark night, indeed.\nAmy: So what can I do for you?\nSheldon: I\u2019m calling to invite you to a spontaneous date night tomorrow evening.\nAmy: Really?\nSheldon: Yes. You were kind enough to watch Raiders of the Lost Ark with me. So I\u2019d like to return the favour by inviting you to watch an episode of your favourite childhood television series, Little House on the Prairie.\nAmy: That sounds lovely. Why are you rubbing your hands together?\nSheldon: Um, I\u2019m putting on lotion. Are you in or not?\nAmy: Of course I\u2019m in.\nSheldon: Excellent. Then I shall see you tomorrow. Good night, Dr. Fowler.\nAmy: Good night, Dr. Cooper.\nSheldon: Good night, indeed. What a rube. Why would I put on lotion when I have such soft hands?\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s apartment.\nBernadette: You were really quiet during dinner. Is everything okay?\nHoward: Yeah. I guess I was just thinking about my mom, and how sad my childhood was.\nBernadette: Yeah, I bet it sucked. I\u2019m gonna take a bath, you do the dishes.\nHoward: How about I take a bath with you and see what happens.\nBernadette: Here\u2019s what\u2019s gonna happen. I\u2019m gonna take a bath, and you\u2019re gonna do the dishes.\nHoward: That\u2019s it? No compassion?\nBernadette: Aw, poor Howie. We good? I\u2019m gonna take a bath.\nHoward: Bernie\u2026\nBernadette: God, what is going on with you? \nHoward: I\u2019m sharing my pain.\nBernadette: And I\u2019m not buying it. Try again.\nHoward: I\u2019m learning to be a man in a culture where it\u2019s increasingly difficult to know how?\nBermadette: Strike two.\nHoward: I\u2019m copying Leonard. When he does this to Penny, they have sex and watch Monty Python.\nBernadette: Howard.\nHoward: I know. It was dumb, I shouldn\u2019t have done it. And it\u2019s making me feel sad. So sad. You know, why don\u2019t you take a bath? I\u2019ll do the dishes.\nScene: Raj\u2019s apartment.\nRaj: Three, two, one. \nStuart: That\u2019s it. Our dating profiles are live on the Internet.\nRaj: Attention all shoppers, my business is open for business!\nStuart: That\u2019s right, ladies. For all you know, I\u2019m confident and fun to be around.\nRaj: Oh, cool, it tells you when someone\u2019s reading your profile. Jenny309. I hope that\u2019s not her weight. \nStuart: If it is, I\u2019ll take her. Ooh, I got one, too. The ladies are coming to us. Oh, man, if I\u2019d started this years ago, I\u2019d be divorced two or three times by now.\nRaj: What? Another one. You know, it, it\u2019s weird. When they\u2019re reading your profile, does it, does it make you feel exposed? Like they see you naked?\nStuart: Well, they\u2019re not running away screaming, so, no.\nScene: The apartment. \nAmy: I love Little House. It made me want to live on a farm so much I tried to milk my cat. That tangy bowl of Cheerios was not worth the stitches.\nSheldon: Well, you sit back, relax and enjoy a beloved childhood memory. You see that cabin there? I read they were illegally squatting on Indian land. Yeah. Personally, I think what we did to the Native Americans was wrong, but this is your favourite show, not mine. Oh, look at little Laura Ingalls, eating that peanut butter sandwich. Peanut butter? Huh? That\u2019s strange, since peanut butter wasn\u2019t introduced until the early 1900s. If I knew this show was about time travel, I would have watched it much sooner.\nAmy: You\u2019re trying to get back at me for what I said about Raiders of the Lost Ark.\nSheldon: That\u2019s silly. Almost as silly as Dr. Baker having a telephone, since telephones only existed in large cities at that time. This is more like Little House on the Preposterous.\nAmy: Sheldon, we\u2019re in a relationship. When you get angry, just tell me. You don\u2019t need to seek revenge.\nSheldon: Are you sure? Every time my dad stayed out all night, my mom would put hamster poop in his chewing tobacco.\nAmy: Well, that\u2019s not how we\u2019re going to do it.\nSheldon: Fine. I\u2019m mad at you. Not only did you ruin Raiders for me, you may have ruined the whole franchise. Except for the fourth one, which was bad before you got your mitts on it.\nAmy: I shouldn\u2019t have said it. I\u2019m sorry.\nSheldon: Thank you.\nAmy: Do you feel better?\nSheldon: Yes. But not as good as I\u2019m going to when I tell you that your precious Garfield has no reason to hate Mondays. He\u2019s a cat. He doesn\u2019t have a job.\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment.\nLeonard: Hey, I was just\u2026 what is happening?\nPenny: Oh, just a little treat. I know you\u2019ve been feeling really bad about your mom lately.\nLeonard: Oh, oh, I have. So bad.\nPenny: And I wanted to make you feel better, so I planned something very special for you.\nLeonard: Uh-huh, I can already feel it working.\nMrs Hofstadter (on webcam): Hello, Leonard.\nLeonard: Mom?\nMrs Hofstadter: I understand you have been whining about my parenting in order to emotionally manipulate your girlfriend. \nLeonard: I\u2026 uh\u2026\nPenny: Bernadette told me everything. Now you don\u2019t get the left or the right.\nMrs Hofstadter: Let\u2019s discuss why you continue to involve me in your sex life.\nLeonard: Oh, please, Mommy. No, Mommy.\nMrs Hofstadter: When you were six years old, you walked in on me and your father naked. I was swatting his bottom with your brand new Ping Pong paddle.\nLeonard: I didn\u2019t dream that?\nMrs Hofstadter: How did that make you feel?\nLeonard: Penny, come back. I\u2019m sad for real now.\nScene: Raj\u2019s apartment. \nRaj: In the last two hours, 162 women have read our profiles. How many of them have sent us messages?\nStuart: Combined?\nRaj: Yes.\nStuart: Zero.\nRaj: Dude, this is, this is brutal. \nStuart: I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever felt so rejected. And I had a rescue dog who ran back to the pound.\nRaj: This is the worst. If we\u2019re gonna get shot down, we might as well just go to a bar and do it old school.\nStuart: And make them look us in the eye.\nRaj: Yeah, anything is better than this.\nScene: A bar. \nRaj: Hello.\nGirl: Not interested.\nRaj: I was wrong. This is worse.\nScene: The apartment. \nHoward: Wait, wait, if it wasn\u2019t for Indiana Jones, the ark would never have ended up at the warehouse. \nSheldon: That\u2019s true. He collected and delivered the ark to the proper authorities for filing.\nRaj: Like a hero.\nAll: Yeah!\nLeonard: Although, technically, Indy was supposed to take the ark to a museum to be studied. He couldn\u2019t even get that done.\nAll: Aw!\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "6_11": "\n\t\t\t\tScene: Penny\u2019s apartment.\nPenny: Okay, now holding sides of hearth in position, lower mantelpiece assembly onto top tabs.\nLeonard: Look at that, I built a fireplace with my own two hands.\nPenny: You\u2019re so butch.\nLeonard: Aw, I got a little paper cut.\nPenny: Of course you did. Your hands are softer than veal.\nLeonard: Oh, before I forget, Saturday I\u2019m planning a little Dungeons and Dragons night with the guys.\nPenny: Really? That\u2019s how you\u2019re gonna spend your Saturday night?\nLeonard: Oh, come on, I hardly ever get a chance to play anymore.\nPenny: Oh, you poor thing. Is having a real-life girlfriend who has sex with you getting in the way of your board games?\nLeonard: Little bit, yeah.\nScene: The apartment.\nAmy: Oh, great! I\u2019ve always wanted to play Dungeons and Dragons.\nSheldon: Yeah, oh, I\u2019m sorry. I should\u2019ve mentioned this earlier. You\u2019re not invited.\nAmy: Why not?\nSheldon: Amy, from time to time, we men need to break free from the shackles of civility and get in touch with our primal animalistic selves.\nAmy: By rolling dice and playing make-believe with little figurines?\nSheldon: Yeah, like a bunch of savages.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s apartment. Bernadette is on the webcam.\nBernadette: Saturday night? But I\u2019ve been working late all week. That was gonna be our night.\nHoward: But I have to go. We play as a group. If-if I\u2019m not there, then everyone will blame you. They\u2019ll be all, Bernadette ruined everything. She\u2019s the worst. So, you see? I have to play Dungeons and Dragons for the marriage.\nBernadette: You\u2019re an idiot.\nHoward: I\u2019m your idiot. Forever.\nScene: Raj\u2019s apartment.\nRaj: So, listen, I know we talked about getting a bite to eat in Silver Lake, and then seeing the Christmas lights in Griffith Park, but Leonard\u2019s talking about a big D and D game at his place.\nStuart: Saturday night just went from crazy to epic. Woo-hoo!\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: All right, Sheldon, to start our quest you need to open this little Christmas gift I got you.\nSheldon: A Christmas gift? You know I don\u2019t enjoy Christmas.\nStuart: What\u2019s wrong with Christmas?\nSheldon: Oh, where to begin? Trees indoors. Overuse of the words \u2019tis and \u2019twas. And the absurd custom of one stocking. Everyone knows socks belong in pairs. Who uses one sock?\nHoward:Pirate with a peg leg?\nSheldon: Actually that helps, thank you.\nLeonard: Would you just look inside?\nSheldon: Oh, a scroll. I like scrolls. They\u2019re my third favourite system of transmitting the written word. After stone tablets and skywriting. You have all been summoned to join a thrilling Dungeons and Dragons adventure. Your quest begins in a secret northern village of elves who have all been massacred. I like where this is heading. Your task is to rescue their leader from a dungeon of ogres. Oh, that\u2019s a saucy twist. That leader\u2019s name, Santa Claus. No, no, no.\nLeonard: It\u2019s actually ho, ho, ho, but you\u2019ll get the hang of it. Thought it\u2019d be fun to make a quest with a holiday theme.\nSheldon: Fun? Mixing Dungeons and Dragons with Christmas is like making a sandwich of grape jelly, the best-tasting jelly, and petroleum jelly, the worst-tasting jelly.\nLeonard: Okay, here we go. You find yourselves in the smoking remains of Santa\u2019s village. Clearly, a great battle has taken place.\nRaj: Oh, man, the first monster I see, I\u2019m gonna sneak up behind him, whip out my wand, and shoot my magic all over his ass.\nStuart: Do you hear yourself when you say these things?\nLeonard: Okay, there are ogre tracks and a trail of broken candy canes in the snow. Sheldon, what do you do?\nSheldon: I signal my contempt for your cruel plan to shove Christmas joy down my throat by making a gesture that says get a load of this guy.\nLeonard: Fine. Howard, what do you do?\nHoward: I follow the ogre tracks, checking for secret doors along the way.\nLeonard: And you discover a secret door leading to a dark corridor.\nHoward: Okay, guys, let\u2019s make a plan, spell casters in the back, warriors in the front.\nRaj: No, screw that noise, I\u2019m going in. Hang on, Santa, I\u2019m coming for you.\nLeonard: Okay, you run into a room full of weapons, hit a trip wire, a cannon blows your face off, you die, you\u2019re out of the game.\nRaj: But, a cannon? Am I really out of the game?\nSheldon: Lucky.\nLeonard: Okay, come on, moving on.\nRaj: Wait, doesn\u2019t anyone have a rod of resurrection? Because if you\u2019ve got one, I need it bad. Get in here with your rod and give it to me.\nStuart: Okay, you need to say these things in your head before you say them out loud.\nPenny (entering): Hey, guys. I don\u2019t mean to interrupt your little game, but I thought you\u2019d like to see what you\u2019re missing out on. So, Bernadette? Bernadette\u2019s wearing leopard-print pumps and a rack-tastic red dress from Forever 21. And there\u2019s Amy, showing all kinds of ankle. In an outfit I\u2019m assuming is from Forever 63. And I, myself am wearing a little number that got me out of two speeding tickets and jury duty.\nSheldon: I know they\u2019re making a rhetorical point, I just don\u2019t know what it is.\nPenny: See you, boys. We are going drinking.\nRaj: Uh, wait, can I come with you? My character died.\nBernadette: Sorry, Raj, it\u2019s girls\u2019 night out.\nAmy: Maybe another time.\nLeonard: Okay\u2026\nPenny: Come on.\nRaj: Ooh! Girls\u2019 night, girls\u2019 night! Ooh! Ooh!\nStuart: How does he not hear that?\nScene: A bar.\nAmy: So, what\u2019s the plan? Are we gonna teach our fellas a lesson by getting stinking drunk, luring strange men into the bathroom, and turning the toilet stall into a temple of the senses?\nBernadette: No!\nPenny: No!\nAmy: Geez, who\u2019s Forever 63 now?\nRaj: Can we get another bottle of champagne for the table? Don\u2019t worry. It\u2019s my treat.\nAmy: Thanks.\nPenny: Wow, you should come to girls\u2019 night more often. And not just because if you weren\u2019t here, this would be a can of Pabst.\nRaj: My pleasure, nothing makes me happier than the chance to spoil a lady. Just ask my dog. My vet says if I give her any more foie gras, she\u2019s going to die of gout.\nBernadette: Hey, let\u2019s help Raj meet a girl tonight.\nRaj: No, no, no, I\u2019m fine.\nPenny: Okay, wait, are we talking one-night stand or do we want to get him into a relationship?\nAmy: Let\u2019s get him laid!\nRaj: Stop it. You\u2019re ruining girls\u2019 night.\nPenny: Raj, you\u2019re a great guy, you\u2019re in a bar full of single women, let us help you.\nBernadette: Yeah, you\u2019re a real catch. I know you\u2019re shy, but that doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t have someone wonderful in your life.\nRaj: That\u2019s sweet of you. But what can you do to help?\nBernadette: We\u2019ll nose around, see if we can find a nice girl, and then introduce you.\nRaj: Okay. Well, a couple of things. Don\u2019t tell them I come from money. I want them to love me for me. They must be insanely hot. Like, nines or tens.\nPenny: Nines or tens?\nRaj: Okay, an eight is acceptable if she\u2019s willing to bring another eight to the hot tub.\nBernadette: Bottom line, you\u2019ll take any woman who\u2019ll have you, right?\nRaj: In a New Delhi minute.\nScene: The apartment.\nStuart: I don\u2019t remember you buying these miniatures in my store.\nLeonard: Oh, uh, yeah. I got \u2019em on Amazon.\nStuart: Sure. I get it. Why support a friend when you can support a multinational conglomerate that is crushing the life out of that friend?\nLeonard: I know, but when I shop online, I can do it on the toilet.\nStuart: Have you seen my store? The whole place is a toilet.\nHoward: Can we please move this along?\nLeonard: Yeah, sorry. Uh, you come to the end of the tunnel and find a large chest. What do you do? And, Howard, do not say, I feel up the large chest.\nHoward: Excuse me, I\u2019m a married man now. I wasn\u2019t going to say anything so juvenile.\nLeonard: Great. What do you do?\nHoward: I walk up to the large chest, bury my face in it and go \u201cblublublublublublublublu\u201d\nSheldon: I open the chest.\nLeonard: It\u2019s locked, but suddenly the door behind you slams shut and now the walls of the room start closing in.\nStuart: That\u2019s not good. My character and I both have claustrophobia.\nLeonard: Glowing letters appear on the chest that read, If squashed to death you wish not to be, sing of Svaty Vaclav and his victory.\nHoward: Who the hell is Svaty Vaclav?\nLeonard: Walls are getting closer.\nStuart: Oh, boy, happy place, happy place.\nSheldon: Wait, Svaty Vaclav was the Duke of Bohemia.\nLeonard: You\u2019re ten seconds away from getting crushed. Nine, eight.\nHoward: What are we supposed to do?\nLeonard: Seven, six.\nSheldon: Wait, wait. Svaty Vaclav is better known as Good King Wenceslas from the beloved Victorian Christmas carol.\nHoward: Never heard of it. Must be the one Christmas song not written by a Jewish guy.\nLeonard: Three, two.\nStuart: Somebody sing the damn song.\nSheldon: Good King Wenceslas looked out, on the feast of Stephen. When the snow lay \u2019round about, deep and crisp and even\nLeonard: The walls are getting slower.\nSheldon: Brightly shone the moon that night, though the frost was cruel. When a poor man came in sight gathering winter fuel.\nLeonard:The walls stop. You\u2019re safe.\nHoward: That was amazing, Sheldon.\nStuart: How did you know that?\nSheldon: It was simple. I combined a well-known historical fact about Bohemia with the memory of my grandparents, Mee-Maw and Pop-Pop, singing Christmas carols while I sat in front of the fire and tried to build a high-energy particle accelerator out of Legos.\nLeonard: Okay, continuing our quest.\nSheldon: W-W-Wait. There\u2019s still four more verses. You don\u2019t sing a song and not finish it. Hither, page, and stand by me, if thou know\u2019st it, telling. Yonder peasant, who is he? Where and what his dwelling? Brightly shone the moon that night, though the frost\u2026\nScene: The bar. \nBernadette: Looks like he\u2019s doing pretty good.\nPenny: Of course he is. Look, that girl just got dumped by her boyfriend. She\u2019s angry, she\u2019s drunk, and her favorite movie is Slumdog Millionaire. I mean.\nAmy: That is some low-hanging fruit.\nBernadette: Oh, here he comes.\nPenny: So, how\u2019d it go?\nRaj: Great. I bought her a couple of drinks, and she gave me her e-mail address.\nPenny: Ooh!\nBernadette: Jennifer at not-even-if-you-were-the-last-guy-on-earth dot loser.\nRaj: What?\nBernadette: I\u2019m sorry, Raj.\nRaj: Why can\u2019t I find someone? I\u2019m smart, I\u2019ve got a cool job, and my naturally bronzed complexion means I can pull off mustard yellow in a way most guys can\u2019t.\nPenny: Oh, honey, it\u2019s not you, it\u2019s them.\nRaj: No, it\u2019s not. She was too beautiful for me.\nBernadette: Why would you say that?\nRaj: It\u2019s true. I\u2019m always attracted to women I can\u2019t have. I do it all the time. I did the same thing with the two of you.\nAmy: The two of them? I don\u2019t understand.\nRaj: Well, uh, there was a time when I had a thing for Penny, and I thought she was into me, too, because she got drunk and naked and climbed into bed with me. But apparently I misread those signals.\nAmy: And you liked Bernadette also?\nRaj: That was before Penny. I make it a rule to only fall for one of my friends\u2019 girlfriends at a time. I\u2019m very old-fashioned that way.\nAmy: So at, uh, some point, you probably had a thing for me, too.\nRaj: No, not really.\nPenny: Oh, come on, Raj, not even a little bit?\nRaj: Not that I can think of.\nBernadette: Think harder.\nRaj: Nope. I guess the heart wants what the heart wants. Or in this case, doesn\u2019t, I mean, at all. What?\nScene: The apartment. Sheldon is still singing.\nSheldon: Ye who now will bless the poor, shall yourselves find blessing. Ba-da-bum.\nHoward: Done?\nSheldon: I think the word you\u2019re looking for is bravo.\nLeonard: Okay, you leave the room and find yourself standing before a pool of melted snowmen.\nSheldon: Melted snowmen? Are there carrots and lumps of coal in the water?\nLeonard: I don\u2019t know. What\u2019s the difference?\nSheldon: Well it\u2019s a game of the imagination, Leonard. Paint a picture.\nLeonard: Fine. You leave the room and find yourself standing before a pool of melted snowmen. There are carrots and lumps of coal in the water.\nSheldon: What happened to the top hats and the corncob pipes?\nLeonard: You see those, too.\nSheldon: Oh, it\u2019s like I\u2019m really there.\nStuart: I gotta tell you, this, this is the most holiday fun I\u2019ve had since my therapist changed my anxiety medication and I stopped caring about the blood in my stool.\nHoward: Good story.\nLeonard: What are you drinking there? A little eggnog?\nSheldon: Yes. What, is there a problem?\nLeonard: No, it\u2019s nice to see you enjoying a holiday beverage. Pretty Christmassy.\nSheldon: Since when is eggnog a Christmas drink? Eggs are available all year \u2019round. I\u2019ve been known to enjoy this poolside.\nLeonard: Come on, Sheldon. You know all the Christmas stories, and the carols, you\u2019ve got an eggnog moustache going on there. Just admit it. You\u2019re getting a little Yuletide spirit.\nSheldon: Oh, don\u2019t be silly. Christmas is a bunch of baloney created by the tinsel industry. Why is this so important to you?\nLeonard: Honestly, because I had enough crappy Christmases as a kid and I\u2019m tired of you sucking the joy out of them now.\nStuart: What was so bad about them?\nLeonard: I grew up in a house full of crazy academics. Instead of leaving Santa milk and cookies, we had to leave him a research paper. And in the morning, you could tell he\u2019d been there because the paper would be graded.\nSheldon: No wonder you love Christmas. That sounds amazing.\nLeonard: It wasn\u2019t amazing. I got a C-minus four years in a row.\nSheldon: Yeah, I\u2019m familiar with your work. C-minus was your gift.\nScene: The bar.\nRaj: Amy, I\u2019m really sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to upset you.\nAmy: It\u2019s fine. I\u2019m used to being the girl who never gets looked at twice. I didn\u2019t have my first kiss till I was 22, and the guy only did it so I\u2019d give him back his insulin.\nBernadette: Sometimes the pancreas wants what the pancreas wants.\nAmy: Forget it. I don\u2019t expect you guys to understand.\nRaj: I understand. In seventh grade, I played Spin the Bottle and it landed on Alina Shankar. She said if I came near her, she would break the bottle and cut me.\nAmy: You think that\u2019s bad? In college, I passed out at a frat party and woke up with more clothes on.\nRaj: Sometimes I get so lonely, I sit on my left hand until it goes numb, then I put it in my right hand and pretend I\u2019m holding hands with another person.\nAmy: I do that, too. Sometimes the left hand tries to cop a feel. And I let it.\nRaj: It\u2019s kind of nice to talk to someone who understands what it feels like to be alone.\nAmy: It is, isn\u2019t it?\nRaj: But you\u2019re not alone anymore. Now you\u2019ve got Sheldon.\nAmy: I do. And don\u2019t worry, someday you\u2019ll have somebody, too.\nRaj: Thank you. I hope she\u2019s half as lovely and amazing as you are.\nAmy: Thank you, Rajesh. He wants me, I\u2019m good. We can go now.\nRaj: Damn it.\nPenny: What?\nRaj: Now that I know she doesn\u2019t like me, I\u2019m kind of into her.\nScene: The apartment. Sheldon is writing numbers on a whiteboard.\nSheldon: All right. I think I cracked the code to lower the drawbridge.\nHoward: Great. Let\u2019s do it. (They pick up bells and play according to the numbers. The tune is Jingle Bells)\nLeonard: The drawbridge is lowering.\nStuart: My carpal tunnel\u2019s acting up.\nSheldon: Play through the pain.\nLeonard: You did it. The drawbridge is down. You cross the chasm and find yourself in a small dungeon room. And in the corner, chained to the wall, you see a bloodied and beaten Santa Claus. He says, ho, ho, help me.\nHoward: Yes, we found Santa. Christmas is saved. Don\u2019t ever tell my mother I said that.\nStuart: I take out my skeleton key and run to Santa to unchain him.\nSheldon: But first, I cast a spell of paralysis on Stuart and Howard.\nHoward: Wait, what are you doing?\nSheldon: You can\u2019t talk, you\u2019re paralyzed. I get right up in Santa\u2019s big, fat face and say, well, well, well, jolly old Saint Nick, we meet again. Yeah, I believe the last time we spoke was in the Baybrook Mall in Galveston, Texas, when I was five years old, isn\u2019t that right?\nLeonard: Uh, okay.\nSheldon: My mother dragged me there and she plopped me down on your lap and you asked me what I wanted for Christmas. And I told you, my Pop-Pop, because that was the year my grandfather died. I missed him and I wanted him back.\nLeonard: This is weird, right?\nSheldon: Pop-Pop was the only one in my family who encouraged me to pursue science. But you didn\u2019t bring him back, did you? No, instead, I got Lincoln Logs. Well, you can build a lot of neat things out of Lincoln Logs, but Pop-Pop ain\u2019t one of \u2019em. And now you\u2019re here asking me for something, to save you. Well, sorry, Mr. Kringle, but today\u2019s not your day. I\u2019m leaving you here to rot, and I hope the ogres feast on your bones. I take the skeleton key, and I toss it into the chasm, and on the way out, I give Santa a swift kick in his bowl full of jelly!\nLeonard: Okay. So Wolowitz and Stuart are paralyzed, Santa\u2019s dead, and I picked this over having sex with my girlfriend.\nScene: The apartment, late at night. \nSheldon: Santa?\nSanta: Oh, hello, Sheldon. You should be asleep.\nSheldon: Well, then, you shouldn\u2019t have jingle bells on your boots.\nSanta: Oh. I\u2019ve been wanting to talk to you. I\u2019m sorry I disappointed you when you were a little boy. I can do a lot of magical things, but unfortunately bringing your Pop-Pop back isn\u2019t one of them.\nSheldon: I understand.\nSanta: But I do have something special for you. Close your eyes.\nSheldon: Oh, I hope it\u2019s a train.\nSanta: Oh, it\u2019s better than a train.\nSheldon: Two trains?\nSanta: Better.\nSheldon: I\u2019m getting three trains.\nSanta: Okay, open \u2019em. (It\u2019s a cannon, pointed at Sheldon) This is for leaving me in the dungeon to be eaten alive by ogres!\nSheldon: Wait, uh, uh, hang on. In my defense\u2026\nSanta: Ho, ho, ho, ya big dork.

We just had Thai food. In that culture, the last morsel is called the krengjai piece, and it is reserved for the most important and valued member of the group.\nPenny: Thank you all for this high honour.\nSheldon: I\u2019ve seen pictures of your mother, keep eating.\nHoward: All right, honey, if we\u2019re gonna make the movie, we should go. (Raj stands) This may be hard for you to hear, but when I say honey, I mean my fianc\u00e9e. (Raj whispers to him) Yeah, well, now it means her.\nBernadette: It\u2019s okay if he wants to come.\nHoward: Fine. But next time, we get a sitter.\nPenny: All right, I got to go to work. I\u2019ll walk down with you.\nSheldon: Wait. Uh, which is closer to the new train store in Monrovia, the movie theatre or the Cheesecake Factory?\nHoward: Neither of them are close.\nSheldon: Oh, well, then I guess it doesn\u2019t matter which one of you drives me. Let\u2019s play a fun guessing game to see who gets to take me. All right, this four-letter word describes either a printer\u2019s type size or a compulsion to eat dirt.\nPenny: Okay, I\u2019m not driving him.\nSheldon: No, Penny, don\u2019t give up, you can get this.\nLeonard: Aren\u2019t you going with Sheldon?\nAmy: No, I have no interest in model trains, stores that sell them, nor their heartbreaking clientele.\nLeonard: Oh. Well, I have some work to do, so\u2026\nAmy: I can\u2019t imagine that would disturb me. Carry on.\nLeonard: Okay. Wouldn\u2019t you be more comfortable at home?\nAmy: Not really, no.\nLeonard: All righty then. Guess I\u2019ll just get started.\nAmy: Leonard, please. I don\u2019t need the running commentary.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The apartment. Amy is staring into space.\nLeonard: Amy?\nAmy: Yo.\nLeonard: You okay?\nAmy: Oh, sure.\nLeonard: I thought you were reading.\nAmy: I was. Now I\u2019m thinking about what I read. You all right, Leonard? You seem very uncomfortable.\nLeonard: I, I\u2019m fine.\nAmy: Should I go? I\u2019ve been told sometimes I overstay my welcome.\nLeonard: What, who told you that?\nAmy: Well, most recently my gynaecologist.\nLeonard: Well, you stay as long as you\u2019d like.\nAmy: I\u2019m glad to hear you say that, because I\u2019m having a wonderful time. Hmm, I said the same thing to my gynaecologist.\nScene: Raj\u2019s car.\nBernadette: What are you going to get at the train store, Sheldon?\nSheldon: Oh, I\u2019m not buying anything. They\u2019re having a lecture. H-O gauge railroading. Half the size of O-gauge, but twice the fun. Very controversial topic.\nHoward: Which side do you come down on?\nSheldon: I\u2019ll let you know after tonight. Unlike some people, I\u2019m going in with an open mind. Who am I kidding? Of course we all know it\u2019s O-gauge or no gauge.\nHoward: Can you believe grown men sit around and play with toy trains?\nBernadette: That\u2019s pretty big talk for a man with a closet full of magic tricks at his mother\u2019s house.\nHoward: First of all, they\u2019re not tricks, they\u2019re illusions. And, secondly, when we get married, they\u2019re all going up in the attic so you can have that closet for clothes.\nBernadette: Why would I keep clothes at your mother\u2019s house?\nHoward: Well, don\u2019t think of it that way. Once we move in, it\u2019ll be our house.\nBernadette: Is she moving out?\nHoward: Why would she move out? It\u2019s her house.\nBernadette: Hang on. You seriously think I\u2019m going to live with your mother?\nSheldon: Howard, I think I can help here. Yes, Bernadette, that\u2019s exactly what he thinks.\nHoward: Why not? It\u2019s a great house, plenty of room, and if we have kids, Mom\u2019s there to help. You know, when she tells the Three Little Pigs story, she actually has hair on her chinny-chin-chin.\nBernadette: I\u2019m not gonna live with your mother. Not now, not ever.\nHoward: Wow, someone obviously has some mommy issues.\nBernadette: Raj, take me home.\nHoward: Don\u2019t listen to her. Go to the movie theatre.\nBernadette: Take me home now.\nHoward: Movie theatre.\nRaj: Mmmmmm.\nSheldon: Okay, everybody calm down. There is a simple solution here. Raj, take me to the train store, and then I don\u2019t care what you people do.\nScene: The apartment.\nAmy: How was your shower?\nLeonard: It was good, good. Just out of curiosity, what time do you usually go to bed?\nAmy: Oh, I\u2019m up all night. I\u2019m like a possum. Boy, you were not liked in high school, were you?\nLeonard: Not really. Is that my yearbook?\nAmy: Mm-hmm. Dear Leonard, you\u2019re really good at science. Maybe one day you\u2019ll come up with a cure for being a dork.\nLeonard: Well, it wasn\u2019t spray-painting a lightning bolt on my briefcase, I can tell you that.\nAmy: If it makes you feel any better, the only person who signed my yearbook was my mother.\nLeonard: Aw.\nAmy: Dear Amy, self-respect and a hymen are better than friends and fun. Love, Mom.\nSheldon (entering): Well, you can add Jerry\u2019s Junction to the list of train stores Sheldon Cooper will never set foot in again.\nLeonard: Rough night, Casey Jones?\nSheldon: You don\u2019t know the half of it. It was billed as a lively give-and-take on the merits of model train sizes. But it was actually a set-up to intimidate weak-minded spineless rubes into buying H-O starter sets.\nLeonard: What\u2019s in the bag?\nSheldon: I don\u2019t want to talk about it. But it\u2019s not a spine,I\u2019ll tell you that.\nAmy: Well, I had a delightful evening, Leonard. We should do this again sometime.\nLeonard: Ah, sure. That\u2019d be nice.\nAmy: Glad to hear it. I need someone to accompany me to the wedding of Dr. Moranelli and Dr. Gustufson this Friday. They\u2019re kind of the Brad and Angelina of the primatology department.\nLeonard: Wouldn\u2019t you rather bring Sheldon?\nAmy: I would, but the last wedding we went to was a disaster. He behaved like a child the entire time.\nSheldon: Not my fault. You said there\u2019d be other scientists there my age.\nAmy: Doesn\u2019t matter. You\u2019re out, he\u2019s in. No date to the prom, two dates to a wedding. Hmm, how times change.\nSheldon: Ha-ha, you have to go to a wedding.\nScene: Outside Howard\u2019s house. Amy rings the bell.\nHoward (off): I\u2019ll get it!\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Could you get it?\nHoward (off): I said I\u2019m getting it!\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Fine, I\u2019ll get it!\nHoward: I got it! Oh, hi.\nBernadette: Hey. I don\u2019t want to fight. I was just surprised when you sprung the whole living-with-your-mom stuff on me.\nHoward: Yeah, well, I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t run it by you first.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): I don\u2019t know who you\u2019re talking to, but in or out! We don\u2019t need bugs!\nHoward: The bugs only come here because you\u2019re their queen! Listen, how about this. Before we make any kind of decision about where we live, we have a trial run. Stay here for a weekend, see what it\u2019s like.\nBernadette: And your mom would be okay with that?\nHoward: Sure she would. Ma, do you mind if Bernadette stays here this weekend?\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Hey, if she\u2019s willing to give the milk away for free, who am I to say no?\nHoward: See? She\u2019s good with it.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Frankly, after all your sleepovers with the little brown boy, a girl is a big relief!\nScene: The apartment. Sheldon is playing with his train set.\nSheldon: All this years, I\u2019ve been so wrong. The tinier the train, the more concentrated the fun.\nPenny: You\u2019re a brain scientist. Can you explain to me why a brilliant man likes playing with toy trains?\nAmy: Not without cutting his head open, no. How about making my eyes like Cleopatra?\nPenny: Really? For a wedding?\nAmy: Perhaps you\u2019re right. My cheekbones and beckoning pelvis already have a certain hello sailor quality to them.\nLeonard: Ready.\nPenny: Aw. So handsome. Like James Bond.\nSheldon: Better than James Bond, because he\u2019s tinier.\nAmy: I got you this to give to me.\nPenny: Oh, sweetie, guests don\u2019t normally wear corsages to a wedding. That\u2019s more of a prom thing.\nAmy: I never went to my prom. My mom paid my cousin to take me, but he just used the money to buy drugs.\nPenny: Put the corsage on her.\nLeonard: Amy, this is for you.\nAmy: When you\u2019re done copping a feel, that goes on my wrist.\nSheldon: All aboard! Woo-woo! It\u2019s official. I\u2019m an H-O trainiac.\nScene: Howard\u2019s bedroom.\nHoward: So, dinner went nice.\nBernadette: Yeah. Yeah, I guess. Does your mother always cut your meat for you?\nHoward: Only when it\u2019s fatty. Well, don\u2019t be jealous, babe. Someday you\u2019ll get to cut it for me.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Bernadette! I found the extra head for the Waterpik if you want to use it!\nBernadette: I\u2019m okay, Mrs. Wolowitz.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): You sure? I just squirted half a brisket outta my teeth!\nHoward: Hey, Ma, how about a little privacy?\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Oh, I know what that means! Hubba-hubba!\nBernadette: Oh, God.\nHoward: Relax, it\u2019ll be fine.\nBernadette: Okay.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Let me know when you\u2019re done canoodling! Mommy needs a foot rub!\nScene: The wedding.\nAmy: Would you like to dance?\nLeonard: No, thank you. I\u2019m really not much of a dancer.\nAmy: You\u2019re not exactly winning any trophies as a conversationalist, either.\nLeonard: I\u2019m sorry. The bride and groom seem happy.\nAmy: Why shouldn\u2019t they be? They have a feverish night of socially-approved copulation ahead of them. In some cultures, we\u2019d stand outside of their bedroom cheering as they achieved orgasm.\nLeonard: That sounds like a late night, and I have work in the morning, so\u2026\nAmy: Leonard, you may not have noticed, but I am being a delight here. And you\u2019re not holding up your end of the evening.\nLeonard: Oh, sorry. This wedding just reminds me of my kinda-sorta girlfriend 9,000 miles away.\nAmy: I have a kinda-sorta boyfriend who\u2019s playing with a model train right now, you don\u2019t hear me bitching about it. Leonard, a word of advice, moody self-obsession is only attractive in men who can play guitar and are considerably taller than you.\nLeonard: I\u2019m not moody. I\u2019m fun.\nAmy: You have any evidence to support that statement?\nLeonard: Well, hey, I\u2019m just as much fun as you are.\nAmy: Really? Are you willing to draw a moustache on your finger as a conversational icebreaker? I am.\nLeonard: Okay, fine, what do you suggest?\nAmy: We just had a lovely meal, the band is on fire, and you\u2019re sitting next to a beautiful woman wearing whorish makeup. Why don\u2019t we head outon the dance floor and see if I can sweat through these dress shields.\nLeonard: Once again, I, I\u2019m really not much of a dancer.\nAmy: Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll lead. (They do the Birdie Song dance)\nScene: Howard\u2019s bedroom. Howard is playing with a lightsabre.\nAmy: Howard?\nHoward: Ready for bed?\nBernadette: No. I need to brush my teeth, but your mother\u2019s been in the bathroom for, like, an hour.\nHoward: Oh. Yeah, she sometimes has problems doing her business. Hang on. Ma, give up! Tonight\u2019s not your night!\nMrs Wolowitz (off): You don\u2019t know that! I just sat down!\nHoward: Come on, take a break! Bernadette needs to brush her teeth!\nMrs Wolowitz (off): She can come in and brush her teeth! I\u2019m not embarrassed!\nHoward: Problem solved.\nBernadette: No, it\u2019s not. I\u2019m not going in there.\nHoward: Oh, come on, honey. She\u2019s just sitting in there reading a magazine. You can\u2019t see anything. I go in all the time.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Ha! The eagle has landed!\nHoward: And we have splashdown. Wait here, I\u2019m gonna go light a candle. And then we make passionate love.\nScene: The stairwell. Amy is helping Leonard up the stairs.\nAmy: There we go, last floor.\nLeonard: I just can\u2019t figure out what happened. I put my left leg in, I took my left leg out, I put my left leg in, and something just snapped.\nAmy: The hokey pokey is a young man\u2019s game.\nLeonard: I did have a great time. Thank you for reminding me it\u2019s okay to have fun once in a while.\nAmy: You\u2019re welcome.\nLeonard: And also for breaking the head off the ice swan so I could hold it against my pulled groin.\nAmy: I excel at spatial reasoning, and I had a hunch that the graceful slope of its neck would cradle your genitals nicely.\nLeonard: Well, okay. Again, thank you.\nAmy: And again, you\u2019re welcome.\nLeonard: Want to come in, have a cup of tea?\nAmy: No, thanks. I\u2019m gonna head home.\nLeonard: Okay. Well, good night.\nAmy: Good night. (Heads across corridor and knocks on Penny\u2019s door)\nPenny: Ames, hi. How was the wedding?\nAmy: Great. Until I accidentally made Leonard fall in love with me.\nPenny: Come in, let\u2019s talk. Do you want a glass of wine?\nAmy: Wine is one of the reasons I\u2019m in this fix. That and this dang pelvis.\nPenny: Okay, I\u2019m sorry, what exactly happened?\nAmy: The inevitable, he was lonely and vulnerable from missing his girlfriend, while I was charming, supportive and, let\u2019s face it, in this dress, the perfect combination of Madonna and whore.\nPenny: Oh, God, did he make a move on you?\nAmy: No, but it\u2019s only a matter of time. How could I have not seen this coming? Now I\u2019m gonna have to break the little sad sack\u2019s heart.\nPenny: Yeah, I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be okay.\nAmy: Oh, Penny, much as I would treasure knowing that the two of us had been defiled by the same man, Leonard just doesn\u2019t get my motor running.\nPenny: So, um, what are you gonna do? Do you want me to talk to Leonard, let him down easy?\nAmy: No. I\u2019ll let him have tonight. Then in the morning, I\u2019ll send him an e-mail letting him know this body is never gonna be his wonderland. I mean, frankly, you\u2019ve got a better shot than he does.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Leonard. Check it out. I bought an N-gauge locomotive. Half the size of H-O. Look, it fits in my mouth.\nLeonard: Sounds like you had a great night.\nSheldon: I did. How was yours?\nLeonard: Not bad. I had a lot more fun with Amy than I thought I would.\nSheldon: What exactly do you mean by that?\nLeonard: Well, it turns out she really knows how to help a guy loosen up and have a good time. Although, truth be told, my groin\u2019s a little worse for wear. (Sheldon hits him) Ow! Why did you do that?\nSheldon: To send a message. She is not for you.\nLeonard: What?\nSheldon: Not for you!\nScene: Howard\u2019s bedroom.\nBernadette: Good morning, handsome.\nHoward: Morning, Mom.\nBernadette: It\u2019s me.\nHoward: Yes, it is, and you\u2019re so pretty in the morning.\nBernadette: Your mom and I made you breakfast.\nHoward: Oh, wow. So you guys are getting along?\nBernadette: Yeah, I guess. We\u2019re very different people, Howard, so communication\u2019s a little tricky.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Does he like the pancakes?!\nBernadette (in a similar voice): He didn\u2019t try them yet!\nHoward: Is there any butter?\nBernadette: It\u2019s butter-flavoured syrup.\nHoward: Oh.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): So, what\u2019s the word?\nBernadette: He wants butter!\nMrs Wolowitz (off): It\u2019s butter-flavoured syrup\nBernadette: I just told him that!\nHoward: I don\u2019t need any butter.\nBernadette: If you want butter, I\u2019ll get you butter.\nHoward: Well, I guess I\u2019ll cut these by myself.\nLike this:Like Loading...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t"}
